<br>
 Her look serene does purest softness wear,<br>
 Her face exclaims her fairest of the fair.<br>
<br>
This lady borrows her name from her<br>
late keeper, who is now gone to the In-<br>
dia's, and left her to seek support on the<br>
wide common of independence; she is<br>
now just arrived at the zenith of perfec-<br>
tion, devoid of art and manners, as yet<br>
untutor'd by fashion, her charms have for<br>
their zest every addition youth and sim-<br>
plicity can add. She has beauty with-<br>
out pride, elegance without affectation,<br>
and innocence without dissimulation;<br>
and not knowing how long this train of<br>
perfections will last, we would advise<br>
our reader to make hay whilst the sun<br>
shines.</font></span></font></body>
