Miss Go-ld, No. 61, Well-street.
Every woman has not the same talents to please alike, yet, all have \
some peculiar to themselves; the one sings, another dances with a \
peculiar grace. One charms by her sense and sensibility; another \
catches the heart by mere simplicity. Miss Go\'97ld's particular \
advantage is a surprising fond humour which she displays in the most \
agreeable manner imaginable. A mistress of such a turn, must sure be \
very desirable, as nothing in the world can please equal to good \
humour, joined with beauty. This lady lives in very gay life, and \
receives visits only from the best, of whom she makes whatever she \
thinks proper, by help of her agreeable talent. She is but slim made, \
is not above twenty years old, has fine dark brown glossy hair and \
eyes.
