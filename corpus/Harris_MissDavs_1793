<body>Miss Dav&mdash;s, No. 28, Margaret-street, Oxford Market.<br>
<br>
Is a fine tall young woman, of about eighteen, has a fair complexion, <br>
and excellent features; her mouth is small, and looks when closed, <br>
like a rose when it begins to bud; her eyes, however, are no great <br>
advantage to her, as they are small and gray. She has the character <br>
of a spirited, spitefully-fond bed-fellow that will keep her spark to <br>
the mark of business as long as he has strength to follow his labour <br>
with any pleasure or ability. She is seldom guilty of those vices <br>
which have so frequently censured, and which defile the sex more then <br>
any other; we mean drinking and swearing. This, however, is not to be <br>
wondered at, when it is known, (which her company will easily <br>
discover,) that she has been excellently educated, and <br>
notwithstanding the unfortunate bent which the has taken, yet there <br>
are some of the stamina of the original virtues planted in her mind <br>
to be discovered, and which no practices will so eradicate as to <br>
render her vulgar or disagreeable.</body>
