Miss Dav\'97s, No. 28, Margaret-street, Oxford Market.\
\
Is a fine tall young woman, of about eighteen, has a fair complexion, \
and excellent features; her mouth is small, and looks when closed, \
like a rose when it begins to bud; her eyes, however, are no great \
advantage to her, as they are small and gray. She has the character \
of a spirited, spitefully-fond bed-fellow that will keep her spark to \
the mark of business as long as he has strength to follow his labour \
with any pleasure or ability. She is seldom guilty of those vices \
which have so frequently censured, and which defile the sex more then \
any other; we mean drinking and swearing. This, however, is not to be \
wondered at, when it is known, (which her company will easily \
discover,) that she has been excellently educated, and \
notwithstanding the unfortunate bent which the has taken, yet there \
are some of the stamina of the original virtues planted in her mind \
to be discovered, and which no practices will so eradicate as to \
render her vulgar or disagreeable.\
