 Anne Street East_<br>
<br>
 Fool! not to know that love endures no tie,<br>
 And Jove but laughs at lovers perjury.<br>
<br>
 This lady is a native of Devonshire,<br>
and has only been _one_ of _us_ four months;<br>
she is of a fine fair complexion, love<br>
tinctured cerulean eyes, fine teeth, and<br>
genteel good figure; a charming partner<br>
in a dance, a eery good companion by<br>
the fire side, and dearly loves an agreeable<br>
friend and a chearful glass; many a<br>
_man_ of war hath been her willing prisoner,<br>
and paid a proper ransom; her port is<br>
said to be well guarded by a light brown<br>
_chevaux-de-freize_, and parted from _Bum-<br>
bay_ by a very small pleasant isthmus.<br>
The entry is rather straight; but when<br>
once in, their is very good _riding_; and<br>
when they have paid _port customs_, they<br>
are suffered to slip out very easily, though<br>
generally followed by a salute from _Crown-<br>
point_, which hastens their departure by<br>
causing the floodgates to open com-<br>
modiously. She is so brave, that she is<br>
ever ready for an engagement; cares not<br>
how soon she comes to _close quarters_, and<br>
loves to fight _yard arm_ and _yard arm_, and<br>
be briskly _boarded_; she is best pleased<br>
when her opponent is _well armed_, and<br>
Would despise any warrior, who had not<br>
_two_ stout _balls_ to block up her _covered<br>
way_, and did not carry metal enough to<br>
leave _two pounds_ behind him.</font></span></font></body>
