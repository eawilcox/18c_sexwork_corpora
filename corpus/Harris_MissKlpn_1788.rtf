<br>
 Those formal lovers be for ever curst,<br>
 Who fetter'd free-born love with honour first;<br>
 Who through fantastic laws, are virtue's fools,<br>
 And against nature, will be slaves to rules.<br>
<br>
 We cannot pretend to say where this<br>
curious oddity lives, that being a cir-<br>
cumstance she carefully conceals; and<br>
what is more extraordinary, she never<br>
can be prevailed on to go into taverns or<br>
other houses with a gentleman. To<br>
what purpose then (some reader may say)<br>
is she inserted here, if she will not go<br>
into a house to dispense her favors, nor<br>
is it known where she is to be found? A<br>
little patience, good sir, and you will be<br>
informed where she is to be found, and<br>
how to procure her favours. If you<br>
walk on the right hand side of the way,<br>
from the corner of Cheapside along St.<br>
Paul's Church-Yard, and thence to the<br>
bottom of Ludgate-Hill, just after sun-<br>
set, and meet with a beautiful woman<br>
about twenty, tall and finely shaped,<br>
with fine black eyes, and hair of the same<br>
hue, that floats in curls down her back,<br>
and worn without powder, and a be-<br>
witching dimple in each cheek, you may<br>
give a shrewd guess you have found Miss<br>
K--lp--n. Her dress is in general silk,<br>
sometimes a pale blue, but oftener a<br>
black, and a large white sattin cloak,<br>
trimmed and lined with rich brown fur;<br>
her head is in general bedecked with a<br>
blue beaver, with a profusion of white<br>
feathers; and if on accosting her, you<br>
are as much dazzled with her wit, her<br>
smart repartees, and her delicate agree-<br>
able raillery, as with her person and<br>
dress, you may be then absolutely certain<br>
it is the lady.----But you may say, when<br>
found, of what service is it, when she<br>
will neither take you home with her,<br>
nor go into any house With you? A little<br>
more patience, sir, if you plase, though<br>
she refuses to go into any _house_ with you,<br>
are there not hackney coaches on every<br>
stand? we have not said she will deny<br>
entering one of them with you; that is<br>
if she likes your person and conversation.<br>
And here let us add, no frothy coxcomb,<br>
no male adonis, conceited of his own<br>
dear person, no shoe stringed effeminate<br>
puppy, no insipid empty chatterer, can<br>
hope to succeed with her.<br>
<br>
 If, reader, thou art neither of these,<br>
and should meet with, and please Miss<br>
K--p--n, she will take as length'ned<br>
a ride with you as you please; and if<br>
you have the prudence to draw up<br>
the blinds, she Will be as free as you please,<br>
and you may enjoy her charms, _Jehu_ like,<br>
as long as you can. She is framed for<br>
love, and will melt like a snow ball in the<br>
sun. She will embrace you with un-<br>
feigned rapture, open _all_ her charms to<br>
receive your manly tribute, and perhaps<br>
appoint another meeting.<br>
<br>
 We have rather enlarged on this lady,<br>
on account of the singularity of her dis-<br>
position; and what will add to your won-<br>
der is, that she never will receive any<br>
money, but take the offer as an affront.<br>
These circumstances make us conclude<br>
that K--lp--n, the name she has assumed<br>
sometimes, is not her real name, and<br>
that she is not a woman of the town, but<br>
some married city lady, who takes this<br>
method of getting home deficiencies sup-<br>
plied abroad, and, as she is cautious of<br>
her character, uses these precautions.<br>
By not going to any house, she avoids<br>
detection; by chusing none but those<br>
whose conversation is congenial to her<br>
own, she obliges none but men of sense<br>
and honour; and by he constantly re-<br>
fusing money, she demonstrates that love<br>
for love is her motto; that her love of<br>
the sport is her motive; perhaps she<br>
may have another reason for chusing a<br>
leathern conveniency as the scene of her<br>
delights. We have been told that the<br>
undulating motion of the coach, with<br>
the pretty little occasional jolts, con-<br>
tribute greatly to enhance the pleasure<br>
of the critical moment, if all matters are<br>
rightly placed. This she may have ex-<br>
perienced, and therefore as pleasure is<br>
her search, no wonder she prefers every<br>
delicate addition to the gross sum.<br>
