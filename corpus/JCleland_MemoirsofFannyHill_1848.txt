<br>
Madam,<br>
<br>
I sit down to give you an undeniable proof of my considering your<br>
desires as indispensable orders. Ungracious then as the task may be, I<br>
shall recall to view those scandalous stages of my life, out of which I<br>
emerged, at length, to the enjoyment of every blessing in the power of<br>
love, health and fortune to bestow; whilst yet in the flower of youth,<br>
and not too late to employ the leisure afforded me by great ease and<br>
affluence, to cultivate an understanding, naturally not a despicable<br>
one, and which had, even amidst the whirl of loose pleasures I had been<br>
tossed in, exerted more observation on the characters and manners of<br>
the world than what is common to those of my unhappy profession, who,<br>
looking on all though or reflection as their capital enemy, keep it at<br>
as great a distance as they can, or destroy it without mercy.<br>
<br>
Hating, as I mortally do, all long unnecessary prefaces, I shall give<br>
you good quarter in this, and use no farther apology, than to prepare<br>
you for seeing the loose part of my life, written with the same liberty<br>
that I led it.<br>
<br>
Truth! stark, naked truth, is the word; and I will not so much as take<br>
the pains to bestow the strip of a gauze wrapper on it, but paint<br>
situations such as they actually rose to me in nature, careless of<br>
violating those laws of decency that were never made for such<br>
unreserved intimacies as ours; and you have too much sense, too much<br>
knowledge of the originals, to sniff prudishly and out of character at<br>
the pictures of them. The greatest men, those of the first and most<br>
leading taste, will not scruple adorning their private closets with<br>
nudities, though, in compliance with vulgar prejudices, they may not<br>
think them decent decorations of the staircase, or salon.<br>
<br>
This, and enough, premised, I go souse into my personal history. My<br>
maiden name was Frances Hill. I was born at a small village near<br>
Liverpool, in Lancashire, of parents extremely poor, and, I piously<br>
believe, extremely honest.<br>
<br>
My father, who had received a maim on his limbs, that disabled him from<br>
following the more laborious branches of country drudgery, got, by<br>
making nets, a scanty subsistence, which was not much enlarged by my<br>
mother&rsquo;s keeping a little day-school for the girls in her neighborhood.<br>
They had had several children; but none lived to any age except myself,<br>
who had received from nature a constitution perfectly healthy.<br>
<br>
My education, till past fourteen, was no better than very vulgar:<br>
reading, or rather spelling, an illegible scrawl, and a little ordinary<br>
plain work, composed the whole system of it; and then all my foundation<br>
in virtue was no other than a total ignorance of vice, and the shy<br>
timidity general to our sex, in the tender age of life, when objects<br>
alarm or frighten more by their novelty than anything else. But then,<br>
this is a fear too often cured at the expense of innocence, when Miss,<br>
by degrees, begins no longer to look on a man as a creature of prey<br>
that will eat her.<br>
<br>
My poor mother had divided her time so entirely between her scholars<br>
and her little domestic cares, that she had spared very little to my<br>
instruction, having, from her own innocence from all ill, no hint or<br>
thought of guarding me against any.<br>
<br>
I was now entering on my fifteenth year, when the worst of ills befell<br>
me in the loss of my fond, tender parents, who were both carried off by<br>
the small-pox, within a few days of each other; my father dying first,<br>
and thereby by hastening the death of my mother: so that I was now left<br>
an unhappy friendless orphan (for my father&rsquo;s coming to settle there,<br>
was accidental, he being originally a Kentisrman). That cruel distemper<br>
which had proved so fatal to them, had indeed seized me, but with such<br>
mild and favourable symptoms, that I was presently out of danger, and<br>
what then I did not know the value of, was entirely unmarked I skip<br>
over here an account of the natural grief and affliction which I felt<br>
on this melancholy occasion. A little time, and the giddiness of that<br>
age, dissipated too soon my reflections on that irreparable loss; but<br>
nothing contributed more to reconcile me to it, than the notions that<br>
were immediately put into my head, of going to London, and looking out<br>
for a service, in which I was promised all assistance and advice from<br>
one Esther Davis, a young woman that had beer down to see her friends,<br>
and who, after the stay of a few days, was returned to her place.<br>
<br>
As I had now nobody left alive in the village, who had concern enough<br>
about what should become of me, to start any objections to this scheme,<br>
and the woman who took care of me after my parents&rsquo; death, rather<br>
encouraged me to pursue it, I soon came to a resolution of making this<br>
launch into the wide world, by repairing to London, in order to seek my<br>
fortune, a phrase which, by the bye, has ruined more adventurers of<br>
both sexes, from the country, than ever it made or advanced.<br>
<br>
Nor did Esther Davis a little comfort and inspirit me to venture with<br>
her, by piquing my childish curiosity with the fine sights that were to<br>
be seen in London: the Tombs, the Lions, the King, the Royal Family,<br>
the fine Plays and Operas, and, in short, all the diversions which fell<br>
within her sphere of life to come at; the detail of all which perfectly<br>
turned the little head of me.<br>
<br>
Nor can I remember, without laughing, the innocent admiration, not<br>
without a spice of envy, with which we poor girls, whose church-going<br>
clothes did not rise above dowlas shifts and stuff gowns, beplaced with<br>
silver: all which we imagined grew in London, and entered for a great<br>
deal into my determination of trying to come in for my share of them.<br>
<br>
The idea however of having the company of a towns-woman with her, was<br>
the trivial, and all the motives that engaged Esther to take charge of<br>
me during my journey to town, where she told me, after the manner and<br>
style, &ldquo;as how several maids out of the country had made themselves and<br>
all their kind for ever: that by preserving their virtue, some had<br>
taken so with their masters, that they had married them, and kept them<br>
coaches, and lived vastly grand and happy; and some, may-hap, came to<br>
be Duchesses; luck was all, and why not I, as well as another?&rdquo;; with<br>
other almanacs to this purpose, which set me a tip-toe to begin this<br>
promising journey, and to leave a place which, though my native one,<br>
contained no relations that I had reason to regret, and was grown<br>
insupportable to me, from the change of the tenderest usage into a cold<br>
air of charity, with which I was entertained, even at the only friend&rsquo;s<br>
house that I had the least expectation of care and protection from. She<br>
was, however, so just to me, as to manage the turning into money the<br>
little matters that remained to me after the debts and burial charges<br>
were allowed for, and, at my departure, put my whole fortune into my<br>
hands; which consisted of a very slender wardrobe, packed up in a very<br>
portable box, and eight guineas, with seventeen shillings in silver,<br>
stowed in a spring-pouch, which was a greater treasure than I ever had<br>
seen together, and which I could not conceive there was a possibility<br>
of running out; and indeed, I was so entirely taken up with the joy of<br>
seeing myself mistress of such an immence sum, that I gave very little<br>
attention to a world of good advice which was given me with it.<br>
<br>
Places, then, being taken for Esther and me in the Chester waggon, I<br>
pass over a very immaterial scene of leave-taking, at which I droped a<br>
few tears betwixt grief and joy; and, for the same reasons of<br>
insignificance, skip over all that happened to me on the road, such as<br>
the waggoner&rsquo;s looking liquorish on me, the schemes laid for me by some<br>
of the passengers, which were defeated by the valiance of my guardian<br>
Esther; who, to do her justice, took a motherly care of me, at the same<br>
time that she taxed me for the protection by making me bear all<br>
travelling charges, which I defrayed with the unmost cheerfulness, and<br>
thought myself much obliged to her into the bargain.<br>
<br>
She took indeed great care that we were not overrated, or imposed on,<br>
as well as of managing as frugally as possible; expensiveness was not<br>
her vice.<br>
<br>
It was pretty late in a summer evening when we reached the town, in our<br>
slow conveyance, though drawn by six at length. As we passed through<br>
the greatest streets that led to our inn, the noise, of the coaches,<br>
the hurry, the crowds of foot passengers, in short, the new scenery of<br>
the shops and houses, at once pleased and amazed me.<br>
<br>
But guess at my mortification and surprise when we came to the inn, and<br>
our things were landed and delivered to us, when my fellow traveller<br>
and protectress, Esther Davis, who had used me with the utmost<br>
tenderness during the journey, and prepared me by no preceedings signs<br>
for the stunning blow I was to receive, when I say, my only dependence<br>
and friend, in this strange place, all of a sudden assumed a strange<br>
and cool air towards me, as if she dreaded my becoming a burden to her.<br>
<br>
Instead, then, of proffering me the continuance of her assistance and<br>
good offices, which I relied upon, and never more wanted, she thought<br>
herself, it seems, abundantly acquitted of her engagements to me, by<br>
having brought me safe to my journey&rsquo;s end, and seeing nothing in her<br>
procedure towards me but what natural and in order, began to embrace me<br>
by the way of taking leave, whilst I was so confounded, so struck, that<br>
I had not spirit or sense enough so much as to mention my hopes or<br>
expectations from her experience, and knowledge of the place she had<br>
brought me to.<br>
<br>
Whilst I stood thus stupid and mute, which she doubtless attributed to<br>
nothing more than a concern at parting, this idea procured me perhaps a<br>
slight alleviation of it, in the following harangue: &ldquo;That now we were<br>
got safe to London, and that she was obliged to go to her place, she<br>
advised me by all means to get into one as soon as possible; that I<br>
need not fear getting one; there were more places than parish-churches;<br>
that she advised me to go to an intelligence office; that if she heard<br>
of any thing stirring, she would find me out and let me know; that in<br>
the meantime, I should take a private lodging, and acquaint her where<br>
to send to me; that she wished me good luck, and hoped I should always<br>
have the grace to keep myself honest, and not bringing a disgrace on my<br>
parentage.&rdquo; With this; she took her leave of me, and left me, as it<br>
were, on my own hands, full as lightly as I had been put into hers.<br>
<br>
Left thus alone, absolutely destitute and friendless I began then to<br>
feel most bitterly the severity of this separation, the scene of which<br>
had passed in a little room in the inn; and no sooner was her back<br>
turned, but the affliction I felt at my helpless strange circumstances,<br>
burst out into a flood of tears, which infinitely relieved the<br>
oppression of my heart; though I still remained stupified, and most<br>
perfectly perplexed how to dispose of myself.<br>
<br>
One of the drawers coming in, added yet more to my uncertainty, by<br>
asking me, in a short way, if I called for anything? to which I replied<br>
innocently: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; But I wished him to tell me where I might get a<br>
lodging for that night. He said he would go and speak to his mistress,<br>
who accordingly came, and told me drily, without entering in the least<br>
into the distress she saw me in, that I might have a bed for a<br>
shilling, and that, as she supposed I had some friends in town (there I<br>
fetched a deep sigh in vain!), I might provide for myself in the<br>
morning.<br>
<br>
It is incredible what trifling consolations the human mind will seize<br>
in its greatest afflictions. The assurance of nothing more than a bed<br>
to lie on that night, calmed my agonies; and being ashamed to acquaint<br>
the mistress of the inn that I had no friends to apply to in town, I<br>
proposed to myself to proceed, the very next morning, to an<br>
intelligence office, to which I was furnished with written directions<br>
on the back of a ballad, Esther had given me. There I counted on<br>
getting information of any place that such a country girl as I might be<br>
fit for, and where I could get into any sort of being, before my little<br>
stock should be consumed; and as to a character, Esther had often<br>
repeated to me, that I might depend on her managing me one; nor,<br>
however affected I was at her leaving me thus, did I entirely cease to<br>
rely on her, as I began to think, good-naturedly, that her procedure<br>
was all in course, and that is was only my ignorance of life that had<br>
made me take it in the light I at first did.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, the next morning I dressed myself as clean and as neat as<br>
my rustic wardrobe would permit me; and having left my box, with<br>
special recommendation, with the landlady, I ventured out by myself,<br>
and without any more difficulty than can be supposed of a young country<br>
girl, barely fifteen, and to whom every sign or shop was a gazing trap,<br>
I got to the wished for intelligence office.<br>
<br>
It was kept by an elderly woman, who sat at the receipt of custom, with<br>
a book before her in great form and order, and several scrolls made<br>
out, of directions for places.<br>
<br>
I made up then to this important personage, without lifting up my eyes<br>
or observing any of the people round me, who were attending there on<br>
the same errand as myself, and dropping her curtsies nine deep, just<br>
made a shift to stammer out my business to her.<br>
<br>
Madam heard me out, with all the gravity and brow of a petty minister<br>
of State, and seeing at one glance over my figure what I was, made me<br>
no answer, but to ask me the preliminary shilling, on receipt of which<br>
she told me places for women too slight built for hard work: but that<br>
she would look over her book, and see what was to be done for me,<br>
desiring me to stay a little, till she had dispatched some other<br>
customers.<br>
<br>
On this I drew back a little, most heartily mortified at a declaration<br>
which carried with it a killing uncertainly, that my circumstances<br>
could not well endure.<br>
<br>
Presently, assuming more courage, and seeking some diversion from my<br>
uneasy thoughts, I ventured to lift up my head a little, and sent my<br>
eyes on a course round the room, where they met full tilt with those of<br>
a lady (for such my extreme innocence pronounced her) sitting in a<br>
corner of the room, dressed in a velvet mantle (in the midst of<br>
summer), with her bonnet off; squat, fat, red-faced, and at least<br>
fifty.<br>
<br>
She looked as if she would devour me with her eyes, staring at me from<br>
head to foot, without the least regard to the confusion and blushes her<br>
eyeing me so fixedly put me to, and which were to her, no doubt, the<br>
strongest recommendation and marks of my being fit for her purpose.<br>
After a little time, in which my air, person and whole figure had<br>
undergone a strict examination, which I had, on my part, tried to<br>
render favourable to me, by primming, drawing up my neck, and setting<br>
my best looks, she advanced and spoke to me with the greatest<br>
demureness:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Sweet-heart, do you want a place?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, and please you,&rdquo; (with a curtsey down to the ground).<br>
<br>
Upon this she acquainted me she was actually come to the office<br>
herself, to look out for a servant; that she believed I might do, with<br>
a little of her instruction; that she could take my very looks for a<br>
sufficient character; that London was a very wicked, vile, place; that<br>
she hoped I would be tractable, and keep out of bad company; in short,<br>
she said all to me that an old experienced practitioner in town could<br>
think of, and which was much more than was necessary to take in an<br>
artless inexperienced country maid, who was even afraid of becoming a<br>
wanderer about the streets, and therefore gladly jumped at the first<br>
offer of a shelter, especially from so grave and matron-like a lady,<br>
for such my flattering fancy assured me this new mistress of mine was,<br>
I being actually hired under the nose of the good woman that kept the<br>
office, whose shrewed smiles and shrugs I could not help observing, and<br>
innocently interpreted them as marks of being pleased at my getting<br>
into place so soon: but, as I afterwards came to know, these Beldams<br>
understood one another very well, and this was a market where Mrs.<br>
Brown, my mistress, frequently attended, on the watch for any fresh<br>
goods that might offer there, for the use of her customers, and her own<br>
profit.<br>
<br>
Madam was, however, so well pleased with her bargain that fearing I<br>
presume, lest better advice or some accident might occasion my slipping<br>
through her fingers, she would officiously take me in a coach to my<br>
inn, where, calling herself for my box, it was, I being present,<br>
delivered without the least scruple or explanation as to where I was<br>
going.<br>
<br>
This being over, she bid the coachman drive to a shop in St. Paul&rsquo;s<br>
Churchyard, where she bought a pair of gloves, which she gave me, and<br>
thence renewed her directions to the coachman to drive to her house in<br>
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; street, who accordingly landed us at the door, after I had been<br>
cheered up and entertained by the way with the most plausible flams,<br>
without one syllable from which I could conclude anything but that I<br>
was, by the greatest luck, fallen into the hands of kindest mistress,<br>
not to say friend, that the vast world could afford; and accordingly I<br>
entered her doors with most complete confidence and exultation,<br>
promising, myself that, as soon as I could be a little settled, I would<br>
acquaint Esther Davis with my rare good fortune.<br>
<br>
You may be sure the good opinion of my place was not lessened by the<br>
appearance of a very handsome back parlor, into which I was led and<br>
which seemed to me magnificently furnished, who had never seen better<br>
rooms than the ordinary ones in inns upon the road. There were two gilt<br>
pier-glasses, and a buffet, on which a few pieces of plate, set out to<br>
the most shew, dazzled, and altogether persuaded me that I must be got<br>
into a very reputable family.<br>
<br>
Here my mistress first began her part, with telling me that I must have<br>
good spirits, and learn to be free with her; that she had not taken me<br>
to be a common servant, to do domestic drudgery, but to be a kind of<br>
companion to her; and that if I would be a good girl, she would do more<br>
than twenty mothers for me; to all which I answered only by the<br>
profoundest and the awkwardest curtsies, and a few monosyllables, such<br>
as &ldquo;&rsquo;yes! no! to be sure!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Presently my mistress touched the bell, and in came a strapping<br>
maid-servant, who had let us in. &ldquo;Here, Martha,&rdquo; said Mrs. Brown, &ldquo;I<br>
have just hired this young woman to look after my linen; so step up and<br>
show her her chamber; and I charge you to use her with as much respect<br>
as you would myself, for I have taken a prodigious liking to her, and I<br>
do not know what I shall do for her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Martha, who was an arch-jade, and, being used to this decoy, had her<br>
cue perfect, made me a kind of half curtsy, and asked me to walk up<br>
with her; and accordingly showed me a neat room, two pair of stairs<br>
backwards, in which there was a handsome bed, where Martha told me I<br>
was to lie with a young gentlewoman, a cousin of my mistress, who she<br>
was sure would be vastly good to me. Then she ran out into such<br>
affected encomiums on her good mistress! her sweet mistress! and how<br>
happy I was to light upon her! and that I could not have bespoke a<br>
better; with other the like gross stuff, such as would itself have<br>
started suspicions in any but such an unpractised simpleton, who was<br>
perfectly new to life, and who took every word she said in the very<br>
sense she laid out for me to take it; but she readily saw what a<br>
penetration she had to deal with, and measured me very rightly in her<br>
manner of whistling to me, so as to make me pleased with my cage, and<br>
blind to the wires.<br>
<br>
In the midst of these false explanations of the nature of my future<br>
service, we were rung for down again, and I was reintroduced into the<br>
same parlour, where there was a table laid with three covers; and my<br>
mistress had now got with her one of her favourite girls, a notable<br>
manager of her house, and whose business it was to prepare and break<br>
such young fillies as I was to the mounting block; and she was<br>
accordingly, in that view, alloted me for a bed-fellow, and, to give<br>
her the more authority, she had the title of cousin conferred on her by<br>
the venerable president of this college.<br>
<br>
Here I underwent a second survey, which ended in the full approbation<br>
of Mrs. Ph&oelig;be Ayres, the name of my tutoress elect, to whose care and<br>
instruction I was affectionately recommended.<br>
<br>
Dinner was now set on table, and in pursuance of treating me as a<br>
companion, Mrs. Brown, with a tone to cut off all dispute, soon<br>
over-ruled my most humble and most confused protestations against<br>
sitting down with her Ladyship, which my very short breeding just<br>
suggested to me could not be right, or in the order of things.<br>
<br>
At table, the conversation was chiefly kept up by the two madams and<br>
carried on in double meaning expressions, interrupted every now and<br>
then by kind assurances to me, all tending to confirm and fix my<br>
satisfaction with my present condition: augment it they could not, so<br>
very a novice was I then.<br>
<br>
It was here agreed that I should keep myself up and out of sight for a<br>
few days, till such clothes could be procured for me as were fit for<br>
the character I was to appear in, of my mistress&rsquo;s companion, observing<br>
withal, that on the first impressions of my figure much might depend;<br>
and, as they rightly judged, the prospect of exchanging my country<br>
clothes for London finery, made the clause of confinement digest<br>
perfectly well with me. But the truth was, Mrs. Brown did not care that<br>
I should be seen or talked to by any, either of her customers, or her<br>
Does (as they called the girls provided for them), till she secured a<br>
good market for my maidenhead, which I had at least all the appearances<br>
of having brought into her Ladyship&rsquo;s service.<br>
<br>
To slip over minutes of no importance to the main of my story, I pass<br>
the interval to bed time, in which I was more and more pleased with the<br>
views that opened to me, of an easy service under these good people;<br>
and after supper being shewed up to bed, Miss Ph&oelig;be, who observed a<br>
kind of reluctance in me to strip and go to bed, in my shift, before<br>
her, now the maid was withdrawn, came up to me, and beginning with<br>
unpinning my handkerchief and gown, soon encouraged me to go on with<br>
undressing myself; and, blushing at now seeing myself naked to my<br>
shift, I hurried to get under the bed-clothes out of sight.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be laughed and was not long before she placed herself by my side.<br>
She was about five and twenty, by her most suspicious account, in<br>
which, according to all appearances, she must have sunk at least ten<br>
good years; allowance, too, being made for the havoc which a long<br>
course of hackneyship and hot waters must have made of her<br>
constitution, and which had already brought on, upon the spur, that<br>
stale stage in which those of her profession are reduced to think of<br>
showing company, instead of seeing it.<br>
<br>
No sooner then was this precious substitute of my mistress laid down,<br>
but she, who was never out of her way when any occasion of lewdness<br>
presented itself, turned to me, embraced and kissed me with great<br>
eagerness. This was new, this was odd; but imputing it to nothing but<br>
pure kindness, which, for ought I knew, it might be the London way to<br>
express in that manner, I was determined not to be behind-hand with<br>
her, and returned her the kiss and embrace, with all the fervour that<br>
perfect innocence knew.<br>
<br>
Encouraged by this, her hands became extremely free, and wandered over<br>
my whole body, with touches, squeezes, pressures, that rather warmed<br>
and surprised me with their novelty, than they either shocked or<br>
alarmed me.<br>
<br>
The flattering praises she intermingled with these invasions,<br>
contributed also not a little to bribe my passiveness; and, knowing no<br>
ill, I feared none, especially from one who had prevented all doubts of<br>
her womanhood, by conducting my hands to a pair of breasts that hung<br>
loosely down, in a size and volume that full sufficiently distinguished<br>
her sex, to me at least, who had never made any other comparison.<br>
<br>
I lay then all tame and passive as she could wish, whilst her freedom<br>
raised no other emotion but those of a strange, and, till then, unfelt<br>
pleasure. Every part of me was open and exposed to the licentious<br>
courses of her hands, which, like a lambent fire, ran over my whole<br>
body, and thawed all coldness as they went.<br>
<br>
My breasts, if it is not too bold a figure to call so two hard, firm,<br>
rising hillocks, that just began to shew themselves, or signify<br>
anything to the touch, employed and amused her hands awhile, till,<br>
slipping down lower, over a smooth track, she could just feel the soft<br>
silky down that had but a few months before put forth and garnished the<br>
mount-pleasant of those parts, and promised to spread a grateful<br>
shelter over the sweet seat of the most exquisite sensation, and which<br>
had been, till that instant, the seat of the most insensible innocence.<br>
Her fingers played and strove to twine in the young tendrils of that<br>
moss, which nature has contrived at once for use and ornament.<br>
<br>
But, not contented with these outer posts, she now attempts the main<br>
spot, and began to twitch, to insinuate, and at length to force an<br>
introduction of a finger into the quick itself, in such a manner, that<br>
had she not proceeded by insensible gradations that inflamed me beyond<br>
the power of modesty to oppose its resistance to their progress, I<br>
should have jumped out of bed and cried for help against such strange<br>
assaults.<br>
<br>
Instead of which, her lascivious touches had lighted up a new fire that<br>
wantoned through all my veins, but fixed with violence in that center<br>
appointed them by nature, where the first strange hands were now busied<br>
in feeling, squeezing, compressing the lips, then opening them again,<br>
with a finger between, till an &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; expressed her hurting me, where<br>
the narrowness of the unbroken passage refused it entrance to any<br>
depth.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, the extension of my limbs, languid stretching, sighs,<br>
short heavings, all conspired to assure that experienced wanton that I<br>
was more pleased than offended at her proceedings, which she seasoned<br>
with repeated kisses and exclamations, such as &ldquo;Oh! what a charming<br>
creature thou art! What a happy man will he be that first makes a woman<br>
of you! Oh! that I were a man for your sake!&rdquo; with the like broken<br>
expressions, interrupted by kisses as fierce and salacious as ever I<br>
received from the other sex.<br>
<br>
For my part, I was transported, confused, and out of myself; feelings<br>
so new were too much for me. My heated and alarmed senses were in a<br>
tumult that robbed me of all liberty of thought; tears of pleasure<br>
gushed from my eyes, and somewhat assuaged the fire that raged all over<br>
me.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be, herself, the hackneyed, thorough-bred Ph&oelig;be, to whom all modes<br>
and devices of pleasure were known and familiar, found, it seems, in<br>
this exercise her those arbitrary tastes, for which there is no<br>
accounting. Not that she hated men, or did not even prefer them to her<br>
own sex; but when she met with such occasions as this was, a satiety of<br>
enjoyments in the common road, perhaps, too a great secret bias,<br>
inclined her to make the most of pleasure, wherever she could find it,<br>
without distinction of sexes. In this view, now well assured that she<br>
had, by her touches, sufficiently inflamed me for her purpose, she<br>
rolled down the bed clothes gently, and I saw myself stretched naked,<br>
my shift being turned up to my neck, whilst I had no power or sense to<br>
oppose it. Even my growing blushes expressed more desire than modesty,<br>
whilst the candle, left (to be sure not undesignedly) burning, threw a<br>
full light on my whole body.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No!&rdquo; says Ph&oelig;be, &ldquo;you must not, my sweet girl, think to hide all these<br>
treasures from me. My sight must be feasted as my touch. I must devour<br>
with my eyes this springing bosom. Suffer me to kiss it. I have not<br>
seen it enough. Let me kiss it once more. What firm, smooth, white<br>
flesh is here! How delicately shaped! Then this delicious down! Oh! let<br>
me view the small, dear, tender cleft! This is too much, I cannot bear<br>
it! I must! I must!&rdquo; Here she took my hand, and in a transport carried<br>
it where you will easily guess. But what a difference in the state of<br>
the same thing! A spreading thicket of bushy curls marked the full<br>
grown, complete woman. Then the cavity to which she guided my hand<br>
easily received it; and as soon as she felt it within her, she moved<br>
herself to and fro, with so rapid a friction, that I presently withdrew<br>
it, wet and clammy, when instantly Ph&oelig;be grew more composed, after two<br>
or three sighs, and heart-fetched Oh&rsquo;s! and giving me a kiss that<br>
seemed to exhale her soul through her lips, she replaced the<br>
bed-clothes over us. What pleasure she had found I will not say; but<br>
this I know, that the first sparks of kindling nature, the first ideas<br>
of pollution, were caught by me that night; and that the acquaintance<br>
and communication with the bad of our sex, is often as fatal to<br>
innocence as all the seductions of the other. But to go on. When Ph&oelig;be<br>
was restored to that calm, which I was far from the enjoyment of<br>
myself, she artfully sounded me on all the points necessary to govern<br>
the designs of my virtuous mistress on me, and by my answers, drawn<br>
from pure undissembled nature, she had no reason but to promise herself<br>
all imaginable success, so far as it depended on my ignorance, easiness<br>
and warmth of constitution.<br>
<br>
After a sufficient length of dialogue, my bedfellow left me to my rest,<br>
and I fell asleep, through pure weariness, from the violent emotions I<br>
had been led into, when nature which had been too warmly stirred and<br>
fermented to subside without allaying by some means or other relieved<br>
me by one of those luscious dreams, the transports of which are scarce<br>
inferior to those of waking real action.<br>
<br>
In the morning I awoke about ten, perfectly gay and refreshed. Ph&oelig;be<br>
was up before me, and asked me in the kindest manner how I did, how I<br>
had rested, and if I was ready for breakfast? carefully, at the same<br>
time, avoiding to increase the confusion she saw I was in, at looking<br>
her in the face, by any hint of the night&rsquo;s bed scene. I told her if<br>
she pleased I would get up, and begin any work she would be pleased to<br>
set me about. She smiled; presently the maid brought in the tea<br>
equipage, and I just huddled my clothes on, when in waddled my<br>
mistress. I expected no less than to be told of, if not chid for, my<br>
late rising, when I was most agreeably disappointed by her compliments<br>
on my pure and fresh looks. I was &ldquo;a bud of beauty&rdquo; (this was her<br>
style), &ldquo;and how vastly all the fine men would admire me!&rdquo; to all which<br>
my answers did not, I can assure you, wrong my breeding; they were as<br>
simple and silly as they could wish, and, no doubt, flattered them<br>
infinitely more than had they proved me enlightened by education and a<br>
knowledge of the world.<br>
<br>
We breakfasted, and the tea things were scarce removed, when in were<br>
brought two bundles of linen and wearing apparel: in short, all the<br>
necessaries for rigging me out, as they termed it, completely.<br>
<br>
Imagine to yourself, Madam, how my little coquet heart fluttered with<br>
joy at the sight of a white lutestring, flowered with silver, scoured<br>
indeed, but passed on me for spick and span new, a Brussels lace cap,<br>
braited shoes, and the rest in proportion, all second-hand finery, and<br>
procured instantly for the occasion, by the diligence and industry of<br>
the good Mrs. Brown, who had already a chapman for me in the house,<br>
before whom my charms were to pass in review; for he had not only, in<br>
course, insisted on a previous sight of the premises, but also on<br>
immediate surrendering to him, in case of his agreeing for me;<br>
concluding very wisely, that such a place as I was in, was of the<br>
hottest to trust the keeping of such a perishable commodity in, as a<br>
maidenhead.<br>
<br>
The care of dressing and tricking me out for the market, was then left<br>
to Ph&oelig;be, who acquitted herself, if not well, at least perfectly to the<br>
satisfaction of everything but my impatience of seeing myself dressed.<br>
When it was over, and I viewed myself in the glass, I was no doubt, too<br>
natural, too artless, to hide my childish joy at the change: a change,<br>
in the real truth, for much the worse, since I must have much better<br>
become the neat easy simplicity of my rustic dress than the awkward,<br>
untoward, tawdry finery that I could not conceal my strangeness to.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s compliments, however, in which her own share in dressing me was<br>
not forgot, did not a little confirm me in the first notions I had ever<br>
entertained concerning my person; which, be it said without vanity, was<br>
then tolerable to justify a taste for me, and of which it may not be<br>
out of place here to sketch you an unflattered picture.<br>
<br>
I was tall, yet not too tall for my age, which, as I before remarked,<br>
was barely turned of fifteen; my shape perfectly straight, thin<br>
waisted, and light and free without owing anything to stays; my hair<br>
was a glossy auburn, and as soft as silk, flowing down my neck in<br>
natural curls, and did not a little to set off the whiteness of a<br>
smooth skin; my face was rather too ruddy, though its features were<br>
delicate, and the shape was a roundish oval, except where a pit on my<br>
chin had far from a disagreeable effect; my eyes were as black as can<br>
be imagined, and rather languishing than sparkling, except on certain<br>
occasions, when I have been told they struck fire fast enough; my<br>
teeth, which I ever carefully preserved, were small, even and white; my<br>
bosom was finely raised, and one might then discern rather the promise<br>
than the actual growth of the round, firm breast, that in a little time<br>
made that promise good. In short, all the points of beauty that are<br>
most universally in request, I had, or at least my vanity forbid me to<br>
appeal from the decision of our sovereign judges the men, who all, that<br>
I ever knew at last, gave it thus highly in my favour; and I met with,<br>
even in my own sex, some that were above denying me that justice,<br>
whilst others praised me yet more unsuspectedly, by endeavouring to<br>
detract from me, in points of person and figure that I obviously<br>
excelled in. This is, I own, too strong of self praise; but I should be<br>
ungrateful to nature, and to a form to which I owe such singular<br>
blessings of pleasure and fortune, were I to suppress, through an<br>
affectation of modesty, the mention of such valuable gifts.<br>
<br>
Well then, dressed I was, and little did it then enter into my head<br>
that all this gay attire was no more than decking the victim out for<br>
sacrifice, whilst I innocently attributed all to mere friendship and<br>
kindness in the sweet good Mrs. Brown; who, I was forgetting to<br>
mention, had, under pretence of keeping my money safe, got from me,<br>
without the least hesitation, the driblet (so I now call it) which<br>
remained to me after the expenses of my journey.<br>
<br>
After some little time most agreebly spent before the glass, in scarce<br>
self-admiration, since my new dress had by much the greatest share in<br>
it, I was sent for down to the parlour, where the old lady saluted me,<br>
and wished me joy of my new clothes, which she was not ashamed to say,<br>
fitted me as if I had worn nothing but the finest all my life-time; but<br>
what was it she could not see me silly enough to swallow? At the same<br>
time, she presented me to another cousin of her own creation, an<br>
elderly gentleman, who got up, at my entry into the room, and on my<br>
dropping a curtsy to him, saluted me, and seemed a little affronted<br>
that I had only presented my cheek to him: a mistake, which, if one, he<br>
immediately corrected, by gluing his lips to mine, with an ardour which<br>
his figure had not at all disposed me to thank him for: his figure, I<br>
say, than which nothing could be more shocking or detestable: for ugly<br>
and disagreeable were terms too gentle to convey a just idea of it.<br>
<br>
Imagine to yourself, a man rather past threescore, short and ill-made,<br>
with a yellow cadaverous hue, great goggle eyes, that stared as if he<br>
was strangled; an out-mouth from two more properly tusks than teeth,<br>
livid lips, and breath like a Jake&rsquo;s: then he had a peculiar<br>
ghastliness in his grin, that made him perfectly frightful, if not<br>
dangerous to women with child; yet, made as he was thus in mock of man,<br>
he was so blind to his own staring deformities, as to think himself<br>
born to please, and that no woman could see him with impunity: in<br>
consequence of which idea, he had lavished great sums on such wretches<br>
as could gain upon themselves to pretend love to his person, whilst to<br>
those who had not art or patience to dissemble the horror it inspired,<br>
he behaved even brutally. Impotence, more than necessity, made him seek<br>
in variety, the provocative that was wanting to raise him to the pitch<br>
of enjoyment, which he too often saw himself baulked of, by the failure<br>
of his powers: and this always threw him into a fit of rage, which he<br>
wreaked, as far as he durst, on the innocent objects of his fit of<br>
momentary desire.<br>
<br>
This then was the master to which my conscientious benefactress, who<br>
had long been his purveyor in this way, had doomed me, and sent for me<br>
down purposely for his examination. Accordingly she made me stand up<br>
before him, turned me round, unpinned my handkerchief, remarked to him<br>
the rise and fall, the turn and whiteness of a bosom just beginning to<br>
fill; then made me walk, and took even a handle from the rusticity of<br>
my charms: in short, she omitted no point of jockeyship; to which he<br>
only answered by gracious nods of approbation, whilst he looked goats<br>
and monkeys at me: for I sometimes stole a corner glance at him, and<br>
encountering his fiery, eager stare, looked another way from pure<br>
horror and affright, which he, characteristically, attributed to<br>
nothing more than maiden modesty, or at least the affectation of it.<br>
<br>
However, I was soon dismissed, and reconducted to my room by Ph&oelig;be, who<br>
stuck close to me, not leaving me alone, and at leisure to make such<br>
reflections as might naturally rise to any one, not an idiot, on such a<br>
scene as I had just gone through; but to my shame be it confessed, that<br>
just was my invincible stupidity, or rather portentous innocence, that<br>
I did not yet open my eyes to Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s designs, and saw nothing in<br>
this titular cousin of hers but a shockingly hideous person, which did<br>
not at all concern me, unless that my gratitude for my benefactress<br>
made me extend my respect to all her cousinhood.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be, however, began to sift the state and pulses of my heart toward<br>
this monster, asking me how I should approve of such a fine gentelman<br>
for a husband. (Fine gentleman, I suppose she called him, from his<br>
being daubed with lace.) I answered her very naturally, that I had no<br>
thoughts of a husband, but that if I was to choose one, it should be<br>
among my own degree, sure! so much had my aversion to that wretch&rsquo;s<br>
hideous figure indisposed me to all &ldquo;fine gentlemen,&rdquo; and confounded my<br>
ideas, as if those of that rank had been necessarily cast in the same<br>
mould that he was. But Ph&oelig;be was not to be put off so, but went on with<br>
her endeavours to melt and soften me for the purposes of my reception<br>
into that hospitable house: and whilst she talked of the sex in<br>
general, she had no reason to despair of a compliance, which more than<br>
one reason showed her would be easily enough obtained of me; but then<br>
she had too much experience not to discover that my particular fixed<br>
aversion to that frightful cousin would be a block not so readily to be<br>
removed, as suited the consummation of their bargain, and sale of me.<br>
<br>
Mother Brown had in the meantime agreed the terms with this loquorice<br>
old goat, which I afterwards understood were to be fifty guineas<br>
peremptory, for the liberty of attempting me, and a hundred more at the<br>
complete gratification of his desires, in the triumph over my<br>
virginity: and as for me, I was to be left entirely at the discretion<br>
of his liking and generosity. This unrighteous contract being thus<br>
settled, he was so eager to be put in possession, that he insisted on<br>
being introduced to drink tea with me that afternoon, when we were to<br>
be left alone; nor would he hearken to the procuress&rsquo;s remonstrances,<br>
that I was not sufficiently prepared, and ripened for such an attack;<br>
that I was too green and untamed, having been scarce twenty-four hours<br>
in the house: it is the character of lust to be impatient, and his<br>
vanity arming him against any supposition of other than the common<br>
resistance of a maid on those occasions, made him reject all proposals<br>
of a delay, and my dreadful trial was thus fixed, unknown to me, for<br>
that very evening.<br>
<br>
At dinner, Mrs. Brown and Ph&oelig;be did nothing but run riot in praise of<br>
this wonderful cousin, and how happy that woman would be that he would<br>
favour with his addresses; in short my two gossips exhausted all their<br>
rhetoric to persuade me to accept them: &ldquo;that the gentleman was<br>
violently smitten with me at first sight; that he would make my fortune<br>
if I would be a good girl and not stand in my own light; that I should<br>
trust his honour; that I should be made for ever, and have a chariot to<br>
go abroad in,&rdquo; with all such stuff as was fit to turn the head of such<br>
a silly ignorant girl as I then was: but luckily here my aversion had<br>
taken already such deep root in me, my heart was so strongly defended<br>
from him by my senses, that wanting the art to mask my sentiments, I<br>
gave them no hopes of their employer succeeding, at least very easily,<br>
with me. The glass too marched pretty quick, with a view, I suppose, to<br>
make a friend of the warmth of my constitution, in the minutes of the<br>
imminent attack.<br>
<br>
Thus they kept me pretty long at table, and about six in the evening,<br>
after I had retired to my apartment, and the tea board was set, enters<br>
my venerable mistress, followed close by that satyr, who came in<br>
grinning in a way peculiar to him, and by his odious presence,<br>
confirmed me in all the sentiments of detestation which his first<br>
appearance had given birth to.<br>
<br>
He sat down fronting me, and all tea time kept ogling me in a manner<br>
that gave me the utmost pain and confusion, all the mark of which he<br>
still explained to be my bashfulness, and not being used to see<br>
company.<br>
<br>
Tea over, the commoding old lady pleady urgent business (which indeed<br>
was true) to go out, and earnestly desired me to entertain her cousin<br>
kindly till she came back, both for my own sake and her; and then, with<br>
a &ldquo;Pray, sir, be very good, be very tender to the sweet child,&rdquo; she<br>
went out of the room, leaving me staring, with my mouth open, and<br>
unprepared by the suddenness of her departure, to oppose it.<br>
<br>
We were now alone; and on that idea a sudden fit of trembling seized<br>
me. I was so afraid, without a precise notion of why, and what I had to<br>
fear, that I sat on the settee, by the fire side, motionless and<br>
petrified, without life or spirit, not knowing how to look or how to<br>
stir.<br>
<br>
But long I was not suffered to remain in this state of stupefaction:<br>
the monster squatted down by me on the settee, and without farther<br>
ceremony or preamble, flings his arms about my neck, and drawing me<br>
pretty forcibly towards him, obliged me to receive, in spite of my<br>
struggles to disengage from him, his pestilential kisses, which quite<br>
overcame me. Finding me then next to senseless, and unresisting, he<br>
tears off my neck handkerchief, and laid all open there, to his eyes<br>
and hands: still I endured all without flinching, till emboldened by my<br>
sufferance and silence, for I had not the power to speak or cry out, he<br>
attempted to lay me down on the settee, and I felt his hand on the<br>
lower part of my naked thighs, which were crossed, and which he<br>
endeavoured to unlock. Oh then! I was roused out of my passive<br>
endurance, and springing from him with an activity he was not prepared<br>
for, threw myself at his feet, and begged him, in the most moving tone,<br>
not to be rude, and that he would not hurt me. &ldquo;Hurt you, my dear?&rdquo;<br>
says the brute, &ldquo;I intend you no harm. Has not the old lady told you<br>
that I love you? that I shall do handsomely by you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She has indeed, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I cannot love you, indeed I cannot!<br>
pray let me alone! yes! I will love you dearly if you will let me alone<br>
and go away.&rdquo; But I was talking to the wind, for whether my tears, my<br>
attitude, or the disorder of my dress proved fresh incentives, or<br>
whether he was now under the dominion of desires he could not bridle,<br>
but snorting and foaming with lust and rage, he renews his attack,<br>
seizes me, and again attempts to extend and fix me on the settee: in<br>
which he succeeded so far as to lay me along, and even to toss my<br>
petticoats over my head, and lay my thighs bare, which I obstinately<br>
kept close, nor could he, though he attempted with his knee to force<br>
them open, effect it so as to stand fair for being master of the main<br>
avenue; he was unbuttoned, both waistcoat and breeches, yet I only felt<br>
the weight of his body upon me, whilst I lay struggling with<br>
indignation, and dying with terrors; but he stopped all of a sudden,<br>
and got off, panting, blowing, cursing, and repeating &ldquo;old and ugly!&rdquo;<br>
for so I had very naturally called him in the heat of my defence.<br>
<br>
The brute had, it seems, as I afterwards understood, brought on, by his<br>
eagerness and struggle, the ultimate period of his hot fit of lust,<br>
which his power was too short-lived to carry him through the full<br>
execution of; of which my thighs and linen received the effusion.<br>
<br>
When it was over he bid me, with a tone of displeasure, get up: &ldquo;that<br>
he would not do me the honour to think of me any more; that the old<br>
b&mdash;&mdash;h might look out for another cully; that he would not be fooled so<br>
by ever a country mock modesty in England; that he supposed I had left<br>
my maidenhead with some hobnail in the country, and was come to dispose<br>
of my skim-milk in town&rdquo; with a volley of the like abuse; which I<br>
listened to with more pleasure than ever fond woman did to<br>
protestations of love from her darling minion: for, incapable as I was<br>
of receiving any addition to my perfect hatred and aversion to him, I<br>
looked on this railing, as my security against his renewing his most<br>
odious caress.<br>
<br>
Yet, plain as Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s views were now come out, I had not the<br>
heart, or spirit to open my eyes to them: still I could not part with<br>
my dependence on that beldam, so much did I think myself hers, soul and<br>
body: or rather, I sought to deceive myself with the continuation of my<br>
good opinion of her, and choose to wait the worst at her hands, sooner<br>
than be turned out to starve in the streets, without a penny of money<br>
or a friend to apply to these fears were my folly.<br>
<br>
While this confusion of ideas was passing in my head, and I sat<br>
pensively by the fire, with my eyes brimming with tears, my neck still<br>
bare, and my cap fallen off in the struggle, so that my hair was in the<br>
disorder you may guess, the villain&rsquo;s lust began, I suppose, to be<br>
again in flow, at the sight of all that bloom of youth which presented<br>
itself to his view, a bloom yet unenjoyed, and of course not yet<br>
indifferent to him.<br>
<br>
After some pause, he asked me with a tone of voice mightily softer,<br>
whether I would make it up with him before the old lady returned, and<br>
all should be well; he would restore me to his affections, at the same<br>
time offering to kiss me and feel my breasts. But now my extreme<br>
aversion, my fears, my indignation, all acting upon me, gave me a<br>
spirit not natural to me, so that breaking loose from him, I ran to the<br>
bell and rang it, with such violence and effect as to bring up the maid<br>
to know what was the matter, or whether the gentleman wanted anything;<br>
and before he could proceed to greater extremities, she bounced into<br>
the room, and seeing me stretched on the floor, my hair all<br>
dishevelled, my nose gushing out blood, which did not a little<br>
tragedize the scene, and my odious persecutor still intent of pushing<br>
his brutal point, unmoved by all my cries and distress, she was herself<br>
confounded and did not know what to do.<br>
<br>
As much, however, as Martha might be prepared and hardened to<br>
transactions of this sort, all womanhood must have been out of her<br>
heart could she have seen this unmoved. Besides that, on the face of<br>
things, she imagined that matters had gone greater lengths than they<br>
really had, and that the courtesy of the house had been actually<br>
consummated on me, and flung: me into the condition I was in: in this<br>
notion she instantly took my part, and advised the gentleman to go down<br>
and leave me to recover myself, and &ldquo;that all would be soon over with<br>
me; that when Mrs. Brown and Ph&oelig;be, who were gone out, were returned,<br>
they would take order for everything to his satisfaction; that nothing<br>
would be lost by a little patience with the poor tender thing; that for<br>
her part she was frightened; she could not tell what to say to such<br>
doings; but that she would stay by me till my mistress came home.&rdquo; As<br>
the wench said all this in a resolute tone, and the monster himself<br>
began to perceive that things would not mend by his staying, he took<br>
his hat and went out of the room murmuring and pitting his brows like<br>
an old ape, so that I was delivered from the horrors of his detestable<br>
presence.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was gone, Martha very tenderly offered me her assistance<br>
in anything, and would have got me some hartshorn drops and put me to<br>
bed; which last I, at first, positively refused, in the fear that the<br>
monster might return and take me at that disadvantage. However, with<br>
much persuasion and assurances that I should not be molested that night<br>
she prevailed on me to lie down; and indeed I was so weakened by my<br>
struggles, so dejected by my fearful apprehension, so terror-struck,<br>
that I had not power to sit up, or hardly to give answers to the<br>
questions with which the curious Martha plied and perplexed me.<br>
<br>
Such too, and so cruel was my fate, that I dreaded the sight of Mrs.<br>
Brown, as if I had been the criminal, and she the person injured; a<br>
mistake which you will not think so strange, on distinguishing that<br>
neither virtue nor principles had the least share in the defence I had<br>
made, but only the particular aversion I had conceived against this<br>
first brutal and frightful invader of my tender innocence.<br>
<br>
I passed then the time till Mrs. Brown came home, under all the<br>
agitations of fear and despair that may easily be guessed.<br>
<br>
About eleven at night my two ladies came home, and having received<br>
rather a favourable account from Martha, who had run down to let them<br>
in, for Mr. Crofts (that was the name of my brute) was gone out of the<br>
house, after waiting till he had tired his patience for Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s<br>
return, they came thundering up stairs, and seeing me pale, my face<br>
bloody, and all the marks of the most thorough dejection, they employed<br>
themselves more to comfort and re-inspirit me than in making me the<br>
reproaches I was weak enough to fear, I who had so many juster and<br>
stronger to retort upon them.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Brown withdrawn, Ph&oelig;be came presently to bed to me, and what with<br>
the answers she drew from me, what with her own method of palpably<br>
satisfying herself, she soon discovered that I had been more frightened<br>
than hurt; upon which I suppose, being herself seized with sleep, and<br>
reserving her lectures and instructions till the next morning, she left<br>
me, properly speaking, to my unrest; for, later tossing and turning the<br>
greatest part of the night, and tormenting myself with the falsest<br>
notions and apprehensions of things, I fell, through mere fatigue into<br>
a kind of delirious doze, out of which I waked late in the morning, in<br>
a violent fever: a circumstance which was extremely critical to<br>
reprieve me, at least for a time, from the attacks of a wretch,<br>
infinitely more terrible to me than death itself.<br>
<br>
The interested care that was taken of me during my illness, in order to<br>
restore me to a condition of making good the bawd&rsquo;s engagements, or of<br>
enduring further trials, had, however, such an effect on my grateful<br>
disposition that I even thought myself obliged to my un-doers for their<br>
attention to promote my recovery; and, above all, for the keeping out<br>
of my sight of that brutal ravisher, the author of my disorder, on<br>
their finding I was too strongly moved at the bare mention of his name.<br>
<br>
Youth is soon raised, and a few days were sufficient to conquer the<br>
fury of my fever: but, what contributed most to my perfect recovery and<br>
to my reconciliation with life, was the timely news that Mr. Crofts,<br>
who was a merchant of considerable dealings, was arrested at the King&rsquo;s<br>
suit, for nearly forty thousand pounds, on account of his driving a<br>
certain contraband trade, and that his affairs were so desperate, that<br>
even were it in his inclination, it would not be in his power to renew<br>
his designs upon me: for he was instantly thrown into a prison, which<br>
it was not likely he would get out of in haste.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Brown, who had touched his fifty guineas, advanced to so little<br>
purpose, and lost all hopes of the remaining hundred, began to look<br>
upon my treatment of him with a more favourable eye; and as they had<br>
observed my temper to be perfectly tractable and conformable to their<br>
views, all the girls that composed her flock were suffered to visit me,<br>
and had their cue to dispose me, by their conversation, to a perfect<br>
resignation of myself to Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s direction.<br>
<br>
Accordingly they were let in upon me, and all that frolic and<br>
thoughtless gaiety in which those giddy creatures consume either<br>
leisure, made me envy a condition of which I only saw the fair side;<br>
insomuch, that the being one of them became even my ambition: a<br>
disposition which they all carefully cultivated; and I wanted now<br>
nothing but to restore my health, that I might be able to undergo the<br>
ceremony of the initiation.<br>
<br>
Conversation, example, in short all, contributed, in that house, to<br>
corrupt my native parity, which had taken no root in education; whilst<br>
now the inflammable principal of pleasure, so easily fired at my age,<br>
made strange work within me, and all the modesty I was brought up in<br>
the habit, not the instruction of, began to melt away like dew before<br>
the sun&rsquo;s heat; not to mention that I made a vice of necessity, from<br>
the constant fears I had of being turned out to starve.<br>
<br>
I was soon pretty well recovered, and at certain hours allowed to range<br>
all over the house, but cautiously kept from seeing any company till<br>
the arrival of Lord B&mdash;&mdash;, from Bath, to whom Mrs. Brown, in respect to<br>
his experienced generosity on such occasions, proposed to offer the<br>
perusal of that trinket of mine, which bears so great an imaginary<br>
value; and his lordship being expected in town in less than a<br>
fortnight, Mrs. Brown judged I would be entirely renewed in beauty and<br>
freshness by that time, and afforded her the chance of a better bargain<br>
than she had driven with Mr. Crofts.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I was so thoroughly, as they call it, brought over, so<br>
tame to their whistle, that, had my cage door been set open, I had no<br>
idea that I ought to fly anywhere, sooner than stay where I was; nor<br>
had I the least sense of regretting my condition, but waited very<br>
quietly for whatever Mrs. Brown should order concerning me; who on her<br>
side, by herself and her agents, took more than the necessary<br>
precautions to lull and lay asleep all just reflections on my destiny.<br>
<br>
Preachments of morality over the left shoulder; a life of joy painted<br>
in the gayest colours; caresses, promises, indulgent treatment;<br>
nothing, in short, was wanting to domesticate me entirely and to<br>
prevent my going out anywhere to get better advice. Alas! I dreamed of<br>
no such thing.<br>
<br>
Hitherto I had been indebted only to the girls of the house for the<br>
corruption of my innocence: their luscious talk, in which modesty was<br>
far from respected, their description of their engagements with men,<br>
had given me a tolerable insight into the nature and mysteries of their<br>
profession, at the same time that they highly provoked an itch of<br>
florid warm-spirited blood through every vein: but above all, my bed<br>
fellow Ph&oelig;be, whose pupil I more immediately was, exerted her talents<br>
in giving me the first tinctures of pleasure: whilst nature, now warmed<br>
and wantoned with discoveries so interesting, piqued a curiosity which<br>
Ph&oelig;be artfully whetted, and leading me from question to question of her<br>
own suggestion, explained to me all the mysteries of Venus. But I could<br>
not long remain in such a house as that, without being an eye-witness<br>
of more than I could conceive from her descriptions.<br>
<br>
One day, about twelve at noon, being thoroughly recovered of my fever,<br>
I happened to be in Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s dark closet, where I had not been half<br>
an hour, resting upon the maid&rsquo;s bed, before I heard a rustling in the<br>
bed-chamber, separated from the closet only by two sash doors, before<br>
the glasses of which were drawn two yellow damask curtains, but not so<br>
close as to exclude the full view of the room from any person in the<br>
closet.<br>
<br>
I instantly crept softly and posted myself so, that seeing everything<br>
minutely, I could not myself be seen; and who should come in but the<br>
venerable mother Abbess herself! handed in by a tall, brawny young<br>
Horse-grenadiers, moulded in the Hercules style: in fine, the choice of<br>
the most experienced dame, in those affairs, in all London.<br>
<br>
Oh! how still and hush did I keep at my stand, lest any noise should<br>
baulk my curiosity, or bring Madam into the closet!<br>
<br>
But I had not much reason to fear either, for she was entirely taken up<br>
with her present great concern, that she had no sense of attention to<br>
spare to anything else.<br>
<br>
Droll was it to see that clumsy fat figure of her&rsquo;s flop down on the<br>
foot of the bed, opposite to the closet door so that I had a full front<br>
view of all her charms.<br>
<br>
Her paramour sat down by her: he seemed to be a man of very few words,<br>
and a great stomach; for proceeding instantly to essentials, he gave<br>
her some hearty smacks, and thrusting his hands into her breasts,<br>
disengaged them from her stays, in scorn of whose confinement they<br>
broke loose, and sagged down, navel-low at least. A more enormous pair<br>
did my eyes never behold, nor of a worse colour, flagging, soft, and<br>
most lovingly contiguous: yet such as they were, this great beef-eater<br>
seemed to paw them with a most unenviable lust, seeking in vain to<br>
confine or cover one of them with a hand scarce less than a shoulder of<br>
mutton. After toying with them thus some time, as if they had been<br>
worth it, he laid her down pretty briskly, and canting up her<br>
petticoats, made barely a mask of them to her broad red face, that<br>
blushed with nothing but brandy.<br>
<br>
As he stood on one side, unbuttoning his waistcoat and breeches, her<br>
fat brawny thighs hung down, and the whole greasy landscape lay fairly<br>
open to my view; a wide open mouthed gap, overshaded with a grizzly<br>
bush, seemed held out like a beggar&rsquo;s wallet for its provision.<br>
<br>
But I soon had my eyes called off by a more striking object that<br>
entirely engrossed them.<br>
<br>
Her sturdy stallion had now unbuttoned, and produced naked, stiff and<br>
erect, that wonderful machine, which I had never seen before, and<br>
which, for the interest my own seat of pleasure began to take furiously<br>
in it, I stared at with all the eyes I had: however, my senses were too<br>
much flurried, too much concentered in that now burning spot of mine,<br>
to observe anything more than in general the make and turn of that<br>
instrument; from which the instinct of nature, yet more than all I had<br>
heard of it, now strongly informed me, I was to expect that supreme<br>
pleasure which she had placed in the meeting of those parts so<br>
admirably fitted for each other.<br>
<br>
Long, however, the young spark did not remain before giving it two or<br>
three shakes, by way of brandishing it, he threw himself upon her, and<br>
his back being now towards me, I could only take his being ingulphed<br>
for granted, by the directions he moved in, and the impossibility of<br>
missing so staring a mark; and now the bed shook, the curtains rattled<br>
so that I could scarce hear the sighs and murmurs, the heaves and<br>
pantings that accompanied the action, from the beginning to the end;<br>
the sound and sight of which thrilled to the very soul of me, and made<br>
every vein of my body circulate liquid fires: the emotion grew so<br>
violent that it almost intercepted my respiration.<br>
<br>
Prepared then, and disposed as I was by the discourse of my companions,<br>
and Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s minute detail of everything, no wonder that such a sight<br>
gave the last dying blow to my native innocence.<br>
<br>
Whilst they were in the heat of the action, guided by nature only, I<br>
stole my hand up my petticoats, and with fingers on fire, seized and<br>
yet more inflamed that center of all my senses: my heart palpitated, as<br>
if it would force its way through my bosom: I breathed with pain; I<br>
twisted my thighs, squeezed and compressed the lips of that virgin<br>
slit, and following mechanically the example of Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s manual<br>
operation on it, as far as I could find admission, brought on at last<br>
the critical ecstasy, the melting flow, into which nature, spent with<br>
excess of pleasure, dissolves and dies away.<br>
<br>
After which, my senses recovered coolness enough to observe the rest of<br>
the transaction between this happy pair.<br>
<br>
The young fellow had just dismounted, when the old lady immediately<br>
sprung up, with all the vigour of youth, derived, no doubt, from her<br>
late refreshment; and making him sit down, began in her turn to kiss<br>
him, to pat and pinch his cheeks, and play with his hair: all which he<br>
received with an air of indifference and coolness that showed him to be<br>
much altered from what he was when he first went on to the breach.<br>
<br>
My pious governess, however, not being above calling in auxiliaries,<br>
unlocks a little case of cordials that stood near the bed, and made him<br>
pledge her in a very plentiful dram: after which, and a little amorous<br>
parley, Madam set herself down upon the same place, at the bed&rsquo;s foot;<br>
and the young fellow standing sidewise by her, she, with the greatest<br>
effrontery imaginable, unbuttons his breeches, and removing his shirt,<br>
draws out his affair, so shrunk and diminished, that I could not but<br>
remember the difference, now crest-fallen, or just faintly lifting its<br>
head: but our experience matron very soon, by chaffing it with her<br>
hands, brought it to swell to that size and erection I had before seen<br>
it up to.<br>
<br>
I admired then, upon a fresh account, and with a nicer survey, the<br>
texture of that capital part of man: the flaming red head as it stood<br>
uncapt, the whiteness of the shaft, and the shrub growth of curling<br>
hair that embrowned the foots of it, the roundish bag that dangled down<br>
from it, all exacted my eager attention, and renewed my flame. But, as<br>
the main affair was now at the point the industrious dame had laboured<br>
to bring it to, she was not in the humour to put off the payment of her<br>
pains, but laying herself down, drew him gently upon her, and thus they<br>
finished, in the same manner as before, the old last act.<br>
<br>
This over, they both went out lovingly together, the old lady having<br>
first made him a present, as near as I could observe, of three or four<br>
pieces; he being not only her particular favourite on account of his<br>
performances, but a retainer to the house; from whose sight she had<br>
taken great care hitherto to secret me, lest he might not have had<br>
patience to wait for my lord&rsquo;s arrival, but have insisted on being his<br>
taster, which the old lady was under too much subjection to him to dare<br>
dispute with him; for every girl of the house fell to him in course,<br>
and the old lady only now and then got her turn, in consideration of<br>
the maintenance he had, and which he could scarce be accused of not<br>
earning from her.<br>
<br>
As soon as I heard them go down-stairs, I stole up softly to my own<br>
room, out of which I had luckily not been missed; there I began to<br>
breathe more free, and to give a loose to those warm emotions which the<br>
sight of such an encounter had raised in me, I laid me down on the bed,<br>
stretched myself out, joining and ardently wishing, and requiring any<br>
means to divert or allay the rekindled rage and tumult of my desires,<br>
which all pointed strongly to their pole: man. I felt about the bed as<br>
if I sought for something that I grasped in my waking dream, and not<br>
finding it, could have cried for vexation; every part of me plowing<br>
with simulated fires. At length, I resorted to the only present remedy,<br>
that of vain attempts at digitation, where the smallness of the theatre<br>
did not yet afford room enough for action, and where the pain my<br>
fingers gave me, in striving for admission, though they procured me a<br>
slight satisfaction for the present, started an apprehension which I<br>
could not be easy till I had communicated to Ph&oelig;be and received her<br>
explanations upon it.<br>
<br>
The opportunity, however, did not offer till next morning, for Ph&oelig;be<br>
did not come to bed till long after I was gone to sleep. As soon then<br>
as we were both awake, it was but in course to bring our ly-a-bed chat<br>
to hand, on the subject of my uneasiness: to which a recital of the<br>
love scene I had thus, by chance, been spectatress of, served for a<br>
preface.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be could not hear it to the end without more than one interruption<br>
by peals of laughter, and my ingenuous way of relating matters did not<br>
a little heighten the joke to her.<br>
<br>
But, on her sounding me how the sight had affected me, without mincing<br>
or hiding the pleasurable emotions it had inspired me with, I told her<br>
at the same time that one remark had perplexed me, and that very<br>
considerably. &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;what was that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied I,<br>
&ldquo;having very curiously and attentively compared the size of that<br>
enormous machine, which did not appear, at least to my fearful<br>
imagination, less than my wrist, and at least three of my hand-fuls<br>
long, to that of the tender small part of me which was framed to<br>
receive it, I could not conceive its being possible to afford it<br>
entrance without dying, perhaps in the greatest pain, since she well<br>
knew that even a finger thrust in there hurt me beyond bearing. As to<br>
my mistress&rsquo;s and yours, I can very plainly distinguish the different<br>
dimensions of them from mine, palpable to the touch, and visible to the<br>
eye; so that, in short, great as the promised pleasure may be, I am<br>
afraid of the pain of the experiment.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be at this redoubled her laugh, and whilst I expected a very serious<br>
solution of my doubts and apprehensions in this matter, only told me<br>
that &ldquo;she never heard of a mortal wound being given in those parts, by<br>
that terrible weapon, and that some she knew younger, and as delicately<br>
made as myself, had outlived the operation; that she believed, at the<br>
worst, I should take a great deal of liking; that true it was, there<br>
was a great diversity of sizes in those parts, owing to nature,<br>
child-bearing, frequent over-stretching with unmerciful machines, but<br>
that at a certain age and habit of body, even the most experienced in<br>
those affairs could not well distinguish between the maid and the<br>
woman, supposing too an absence of all artifice, in their natural<br>
situation: but that since chance had thrown in my way one sight of that<br>
sort, she would procure me another, that should feast my eyes more<br>
delicately, and go a great way in the cure of my fears from that<br>
imaginary disproportion&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
On this she asked me if I knew Polly Phillips? &ldquo;Undoubterly,&rdquo; says I,<br>
&ldquo;the fair girl which was so tender of me when I was sick, and has been,<br>
as you told me, but two months in the house.&rdquo; &ldquo;The same,&rdquo; says Ph&oelig;be.<br>
&ldquo;You must know then, she is kept by a young Genoes merchant, whom his<br>
uncle, who is immensely rich, and whose darling he is, on a pretex of<br>
settling some accounts, but in reality to humour his inclinations for<br>
travelling, and seeing the world. He met casually with this Polly once<br>
in company, and taking a likning to her, makes it worth her while to<br>
keep entirely to him. He comes to her here twice or thrice a week, and<br>
she receives him in the light closet up one pair of stairs, where he<br>
enjoys her in a taste, I suppose, peculiar to the heat, or perhaps the<br>
caprices of his own country, I say no more, but to-morrow being his<br>
day, you shall see what passes between them, from a place only known to<br>
your mistress and myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
You may be sure, in the ply I was now taking, I had no objection to the<br>
proposal, and was rather a tip-toe for its accomplishments.<br>
<br>
At five in the evening next day, Ph&oelig;be, punctual to her promise, came<br>
to me as I sat alone in my own room, and beckoned me to follow her.<br>
<br>
We went down the back stairs very softly, and opening the door of a<br>
dark closet, where there was some old furniture kept, and some cases of<br>
liquor, she drew me in after her, and fastened the door upon us, we had<br>
no light but what came through a long crevice in the partition between<br>
ours and the light closet, where the scene of action lay; so that<br>
sitting on those low cases, we could, with the greatest ease, as well<br>
as clearness, see all objects (ourselves unseen), only by applying our<br>
eyes close to the crevice, where the moulding of a panel had warped, or<br>
started a little on the other side.<br>
<br>
The young gentleman was the first person I saw, with his back directly<br>
towards me, looking at a print. Polly was not yet come: in less than a<br>
minute though, the door opened, and she came in; and at the noise the<br>
door made he turned about, and come to meet her, with an air of the<br>
greatest tenderness and satisfaction.<br>
<br>
After saluting her, he led her to a coach that fronted us, where they<br>
both sat down, and the young Genoes helped her to a glass of wine, with<br>
some Naples biscuits on a salver.<br>
<br>
Presently, when they had exchanged a few kisses, and questions in<br>
broken English on one side, he began to unbutton, and, in fine, stript<br>
unto his shirt.<br>
<br>
As if this had been the signal agreed on for pulling off all their<br>
clothes, a scheme which the heat of the season perfectly favoured,<br>
Polly began to draw her pins, and as she had no stays to unlace, she<br>
was in a trice, with her gallant&rsquo;s officious assistance, undressed to<br>
all but her shift.<br>
<br>
When he saw this, his breeches were immediately loosened, waist and<br>
knee bands, and slipped over his ankles, clean off; his shirt collar<br>
was unbottoned too: then, first giving Polly an encouraging kiss, he<br>
stole, as it were, the shift off the girl, who being, I suppose, broke<br>
and familiarized to this humour, blushed indeed, but less than I did at<br>
the apparition of her, now standing stark naked, just as she came ont<br>
of the hands of pure nature, with her black hair loose and a-float down<br>
her dazzling white neck and shoulders, whilst the deepened carnation of<br>
her cheeks went off gradually into the hue of glazed snow: for such<br>
were the blended tints polish of her skin.<br>
<br>
This girl could not be above eighteen: her face regular and sweet<br>
featured, her shape exquisite; nor could I help envying her two ripe<br>
enchanting breasts, finely plumped out in flesh, but withal so round,<br>
so firm, that they sustained themselves, in scorn of any stay: then<br>
their nipples, pointing different ways, marked their pleasing<br>
separation; beneath them lay the delicious tract of the belly, which<br>
terminated in a parting of rift scarce discerning, that modesty seemed<br>
to retire downward, and seek shelter between two plump fleshy thighs:<br>
the curling hair that overspread its delightful front, clothed it with<br>
the richest sable fur in the universe: in short, she was evidently a<br>
subject for the painters to court her, sitting to them for a pattern<br>
female beauty, in all the true pride and pomp of nakedness.<br>
<br>
The young Italian (still in his shirt) stood gazing and transported at<br>
the sight of beauties that might have fired a dying hermit; his eager<br>
eyes devoured her, as she shifted attitudes at his discretion: neither<br>
were his hands excluded their share of the high feast, but wandered, on<br>
the hunt of pleasure, over every part and inch of her body, so<br>
qualified to afford the most exquisite sense of it.<br>
<br>
In the mean time time, one could not help observing the swell of his<br>
shirt before, that bolstered out, and pointed out the condition of<br>
things behind the curtain: but he soon removed it, by slipping his<br>
shirt over his head; and now, as to nakedness, they had nothing to<br>
reproach one another.<br>
<br>
The young gentleman, by Ph&oelig;be&rsquo;s guess, was about two and twenty; tall<br>
and well limbed. His body was finely formed, and of a most vigorous<br>
make, square shouldered, and broad chested: his face was not remarkable<br>
any way, but for a nose inclining to the Roman, eyes large, black, and<br>
sparkling, and a ruddiness in his cheeks that was the more a grace; for<br>
his complexion was of the brownest, not of that dusky dun colour which<br>
excludes, the idea of freshness, but of that clear, olive gloss, which<br>
glowing with life, dazzles perhaps less than fairness, and yet pleases<br>
more, when it pleases at all. His hair being too short to tie fell no<br>
lower than his neck, in short easy curls; and he had a few sprigs about<br>
his paps, that garnished his chest in a style of strength and<br>
manliness. Then his grand movement, which seemed to rise out of a<br>
thicket of curling hair, that spread from the root all over his thighs<br>
and belly up to the navel, stood stiff and upright, but of a size to<br>
frighten me, by sympathy for the small tender part which was the object<br>
of its fury, and which now lay exposed to my fairest view; for he had,<br>
immediately on stoppings off his shirt, gently pushed her down on the<br>
couch, which stood conveniently to break her willing fall. Her thighs<br>
were spread out to their utmost extention, and discovered between them<br>
the mark of the sex, the red-centered cleft of flesh, whose lips<br>
vermillioning inwards, expressed a small ruby line in sweet miniature,<br>
such as Guide&rsquo;s touch or colouring: could never attain to the life or<br>
delicacy of.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be, at this, gave me a gentle jog, to prepare me for a whisper<br>
question: &ldquo;Whether I thought my little maiden-head was much less?&rdquo; But<br>
my attention was too much engrossed, too much inwrapped with all I saw,<br>
to be able to give her any answer.<br>
<br>
By this time the young gentelman had changed her posture from lying<br>
breadth to length-wise on the coach: but her thighs were still spread,<br>
and the mark lay fair for him, who now kneeling between them, displayed<br>
to us a side view of that fierce erect machine of his, which threatened<br>
no less than splitting the tender victim, who lay smiling at the<br>
uplifted stroke, nor seemed to decline it. He looked upon his weapon<br>
himself with some pleasure, and guiding it with his hand to the<br>
inviting; slit, drew aside the lips, and lodged it (after some thrusts,<br>
which Polly seemed even to assist) about half way; but there it stuck,<br>
I suppose from its growing thickness: he draws it again, and just<br>
wetting it with spittle, re-enters, and with ease sheathed it now up to<br>
the hilt, at which Polly gave a deep sigh, which was quite another tone<br>
than one of pain; he thrusts, she heaves, at first gently, and in a<br>
regular cadence; but presently the transport began to be too violent to<br>
observe any order or measure; their motions were too rapid, their<br>
kisses too fierce&rsquo; and fervent for nature to support such fury long:<br>
both seemed to me out of themselves: their eyes darted fires: &ldquo;Oh! oh!<br>
I can&rsquo;t bear it. It is too much. I die. I am going,&rdquo; were Polly&rsquo;s<br>
expressions of extasy: his joys were more silent: but soon broken<br>
murmurs, sighs heart-fetched, and at length a dispatching thrust, as if<br>
he would have forced himself up her body, and then the motionless<br>
languor of all his limbs, all shewed that the die-away moment was come<br>
upon him; which she gave signs of joining with by, the wild throwing of<br>
her hands about, closing her eyes, and giving a deep sob, in which she<br>
seemed to expire in an agony of bliss.<br>
<br>
When he had finished his stroke, and got from off her, she lay still<br>
without the least motion, breathless, as it should seem, with pleasure.<br>
He replaced her again breadth-wise on the couch, unable to sit up, with<br>
her thighs open, between which I could observe a kind of white liquid,<br>
like froth, hanging about the outward lips of that recently opened<br>
wound, which now glowed with a deeper red. Presently she gets up, and<br>
throwing her arms round him, seemed far undelighted with the trial he<br>
had put her to, to judge, at least by the fondness with which she eyed,<br>
and hung upon him.<br>
<br>
For my part, I will not pretend to describe what I felt over me during<br>
this scene; but from that instant, adieu all fears of what man can do<br>
unto me! they were now changed into such ardent desires, such<br>
ungovernable longings, that I could have by the sleeve, and offered him<br>
the bauble, which I now imagined the loss of would be a gain I could<br>
not too soon procure myself.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be, who had more experience, and to whom such sights were not so<br>
new, could not however, be unmoved at so warm a scene; and drawing me<br>
away softly from the peeping hole, for fear of being overheard, guided<br>
me as the door as possible, all passive and obedient to her least<br>
signals.<br>
<br>
Here was no room either to sit or lie, but making me stand with my back<br>
towards the door, she lifted up my petticoats, and with her busy<br>
fingers fell to visit and explore that part of me, where I was<br>
perfectly sick and ready to die with desire; that the bare touch of her<br>
finger, in that critical place, had the effect of a fire to a train,<br>
and her hand instantly made her sensible to what a pitch I was wound<br>
up, and melted by the sight she had thus procured me. Satisfied then<br>
with her success, in allaying a heat that would have made me impatient<br>
of seeing the continuation of the transactions between our amourous<br>
couple, she brought me again to the crevice, so favourable to our<br>
curiosity.<br>
<br>
We had certainly been but a few instants away from it, and yet on our<br>
return we saw everything in good forwardness for recommencing the<br>
tender hostilities.<br>
<br>
The young foreigner was sitting down, fronting us, on the coach, with<br>
Polly upon one knee, who had her arms round his neck, whilst the<br>
extreme whiteness of her skin was not undelightfully contrasted by the<br>
smooth glossy brown of her lover&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
But who could count the fierce, unnumbered kisses given and taken? In<br>
which I could often discover their mouths were double tongued, and<br>
seemed to favour the mutual insertion with the greatest gust and<br>
delight.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, his red-headed champion, that had so lately fled the<br>
pit, quelled and abashed, was now recovered to the top of his<br>
condition, perked and crested up between Polly&rsquo;s thighs, who was not<br>
wanting, on her part, to coax and keep it in good humour, stroking it,<br>
with her head down, and receiving even its velvet tip between the lips<br>
of not its proper mouth: whether it was to render it more glib and easy<br>
of entrance, I could not tell; but it had such an effect, that the<br>
young gentleman seemed by his eyes, that sparkled with more excited<br>
lustre, and his inflamed countenance, to receive increase of pleasure.<br>
He got up, and taking Polly in his arms, embraced her, and said<br>
something too softly for me to hear, leading her withal to the foot of<br>
the couch, and taking delight to slap her thighs and posteriors with<br>
that stiff sinew of his, which hit them with a spring that he gave it<br>
with his hand, and made them resound again, but her about as much as he<br>
meant to hurt her, for she seemed to have as frolic a taste as himself.<br>
<br>
But guess my surprise, when I saw the lazy young rogue lie down on his<br>
back, and gently pull down Polly upon him, who giving way to his<br>
humour, stradled, and with her hands conducted her blind favourite to<br>
the right place; and following her impulse, ran directly upon the<br>
flaming point of this weapon of pleasure, which she staked herself<br>
upon, up pierced, and infixed to the extremest hair breadth of it: thus<br>
she sat on him a few instants, enjoying and relishing her situation,<br>
whilst he toyed with her provoking breasts. Sometimes she would stoop<br>
to meet his kiss: but presently the sting of pleasure spurred them up<br>
to fiercer action; then began the storm of heaves, which, from the<br>
undermost combatant, were thrust at the same time, he crossing his<br>
hands over her, and drawing her home to him with a sweet violence: the<br>
inverted strokes of anvil over hammer soon brought on the critical<br>
period, in which all the signs of a close conspiring extasy informed us<br>
of the point they were at.<br>
<br>
For me, I could bear to see no more; I was so overcome, so inflamed at<br>
the second part of the same play, that, mad to an intolerable degree, I<br>
hugged, I clasped Ph&oelig;be, as if she had wherewithal to relieve me.<br>
Pleased however with, and pitying the taking she could feel me in, she<br>
drew towards the door, and opening it softly as she could, we both got<br>
off undiscovered, and reconducted me to my own room, where, unable to<br>
keep my legs, in the agitation I was in, I instantly threw myself down<br>
on the bed, where I lay transported, though ashamed at what I felt.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be lay down by me, and asked me archly, &ldquo;if, now that I had seen the<br>
enemy, and fully considered him, I was still afraid of him? or did I<br>
think I could come to a close engagement with him?&rdquo; To all which, not a<br>
word on my side; I sighed, and could scarcely breathe. She takes hold<br>
of my hand, and having rolled up her own petticoats, forced it half<br>
strivingly, towards those parts, where, now grown more knowing, I<br>
missed the main object of my wishes; and finding not even the shadow of<br>
what I wanted, where every thing was so flat, or so hollow, in the<br>
vexation I was in at it. I should have withdrawn my hand, but for fear<br>
of disobliging her. Abandoning it then entirely to her management, she<br>
made use of it as she thought proper, to procure herself rather the<br>
shadow than the substance of any pleasure. For my part, I now pined for<br>
more solid food, and promised tacitly to myself that I would not be put<br>
off much longer with this foolery of woman to woman, of Mrs. Brown did<br>
not soon provide me with the essential specific. In short, I had all<br>
the air of not being able to wait the arrival of my lord B&mdash;&mdash;, though he<br>
was now expected in a very fews days: nor did I wait for him, for love<br>
itself took charge of the disposal of me, in spite of interest, or<br>
gross lust.<br>
<br>
It was now two days after the closet scene, that I got up about six in<br>
the morning, and leaving my bedfellow fast asleep, stole down, with no<br>
other thought than of taking a little fresh air in a small garden,<br>
which our back parlour opened into, and from which my confinement<br>
debarred me, at the times company came to my house; but now sleep and<br>
silence reigned all over it.<br>
<br>
I opened the parlour door, and well surprised was I at seeing, by the<br>
side of a fire half-out, a young gentleman in the old lady&rsquo;s elbow<br>
chair, with his legs laid upon another, fast asleep, and left there by<br>
his thoughtless companions, who had drank him down, and then went off<br>
with every one but his mistress, whilst he stayed behind by the<br>
courtesy of the old matron, who would not disturb or turn him out in<br>
that condition at one in the morning; and beds, it is more than<br>
probable there were none to spare. On the table still remained the<br>
punch bowl and glasses, stewed about in their usual disorder after a<br>
drunken revel.<br>
<br>
But when I drew nearer, to view the sleeping estray, heavens! what a<br>
sight! No! term of years, no turn of fortune could ever eraze the<br>
lightninglike impression his form made on me. Yes! dearest object of my<br>
earliest passion, I command for ever the remembrance of thy first<br>
appearance to my ravished eyes, it calls thee up, present; and I see<br>
thee now.<br>
<br>
Figure to yourself, Madam, fair stripling between eighteen and<br>
nineteen, with his head reclined on one of the sides of the chair, his<br>
hair disordered curls, irregularly shading a face, on which all the<br>
roseate bloom of youth and all the manly graces conspired to fix my eye<br>
sand heart; even the languour and paleness of his face, in which the<br>
momentary triumph of the lily over the rose was owing to the excesses<br>
of the night, gave an inexpressible sweetness to the finest features<br>
imaginable: his eyes, closed in sleep, displayed the meeting edges of<br>
their lids beautifully bordered with long eye-lashes; over which no<br>
pencil could have described two more regular arches than those that<br>
graced his forehead, which was high, perfectly white and smooth; then a<br>
pair of vermilion lips, pouting and swelling to the touch, as if a bee<br>
had freshly stung them, seemed to challenge me to get the gloves off<br>
this lovely sleeper, had not the modesty and respect, which in both<br>
sexes are inseparable from a true passion, checked my impulses.<br>
<br>
But on seeing his shirt collar unbottoned, and bosom whiter than a<br>
drift of snow, the pleasure of considering it could not bribe me to<br>
lengthen it, at the hazard of a health that began to be my life&rsquo;s<br>
concern. Love, that made me timid, taught me to be tender too: with a<br>
trembling hand I took hold of one of his, and waking him as gently as<br>
possible, he started, and looking, at first a little wildly, said with<br>
a voice that sent its harmonious sound to my heart: &ldquo;Pray, child,<br>
what-a-clock is it?&rdquo; I told him, and added that he might catch cold if<br>
he slept longer with his breast open in the cool of the morning air. On<br>
this he thanked me with a sweetness perfectly agreeing with that of his<br>
features and eyes; the last now broad open, and eagerly surveying me,<br>
carried the surightly fires they sparkled with directly to my heart.<br>
<br>
It seems, that having drank too freely before he came upon the rake<br>
with some of his young companions, he had put himself out of a<br>
condition to go through all the weapons with them, and crown the night<br>
with a getting a mistress; so that seeing me in a loose undress, he did<br>
not doubt but I was one of the misses of the house, sent in to repair<br>
his loss of time; but though he seized that notion, and a very obvious<br>
one it was, without hesitation, yet, whether my figure made a more than<br>
ordinary impression on him, or whether it was his natural politeness,<br>
he addressed me in a manner far from rude, though still on the foot of<br>
one of the house pliers come to amuse him; and giving me the first kiss<br>
that I ever relished from man in my life, asked me if I could favour<br>
him with my company, assuring me that he would make it worth my while:<br>
but had not even new-born love, that true refiner of lust, opposed so<br>
sudden a surrender, the fear of being surprised by the house was a<br>
sufficient bar to my compliance.<br>
<br>
I told him then, in a tone set by love itself, that for reasons I had<br>
not time to explain to him. I could not stay with him, and might even<br>
ever see him again, with a sigh at these words, which broke from the<br>
bottom of my heart. My conqueror, who, as he afterwards told me, had<br>
been struck with my appearance, and liked me as much as he could think<br>
of liking any one in my supposed way of life, asked me briskly at once,<br>
if I would be kept by him, and that he would take a lodging for me<br>
directly, and relieve me from any engagements he presumed I might be<br>
under to the house.<br>
<br>
Rash, sudden, undigested, even dangerous as this offer might be from a<br>
perfect stranger, and that stranger a giddy boy, the prodigious love I<br>
was struck with for him, had put a charm into every objection: I not<br>
resisting, and blinded me to every objection; I could, at that instant,<br>
have died for him: think if I could resist an invitation to live with<br>
him! Thus my heart, beating strong to the proposal, dictated my answer,<br>
after scarce a minute&rsquo;s pause, that I would accept of his offer, and<br>
make my escape to him in what way he pleased, and that I would be<br>
entirely at his disposal, let it be good or bad. I have often since<br>
wondered that so great an easiness did not disgust him, or make me too<br>
cheap in his eyes, but my fate had so appointed it, that in his fears<br>
of the hazzard of the town, he had been some time looking out for a<br>
girl to take into keeping, and my person happening to hit his fancy, it<br>
was by one of those miracles reserved to love, that we struck the<br>
bargain in the instant, which we sealed by an exchange of kisses, that<br>
the hopes of a more uninterrupted enjoyment engaged him to content<br>
himself with.<br>
<br>
Never, however, did dear youth carry in his head more wherewith to<br>
justify the turning of a girl&rsquo;s head, and making her set all<br>
consequences at defiance, for the sake of following a gallant.<br>
<br>
For, besides all the perfections of manly beauty which were assembled<br>
in his form, he had an air of neatness and gentility, certain smartness<br>
in the carriage and port of his head, that yet more distinguished him;<br>
his eyes were sprightly and full of meaning; his looks had in them<br>
something at once sweet and commanding; his complexion out-bloomed the<br>
lovely coloured rose, whilst its inimitable tender vivid glow clearly<br>
saved it from the reproach of wanting life, of raw and dough-like,<br>
which is commonly made of those so extremely fair as he was.<br>
<br>
Our little plan was, that I should get out about seven the next morning<br>
(which I could readily promise, as I knew where to get the key of the<br>
street door) and he would wait at the end of the street with a coach to<br>
convey me safe off; after which, we would send, and clear any debt<br>
incurred by my stay at Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s, who, he only judged, in gross,<br>
might not care to part with one, he thought, so fit to draw custom to<br>
the house.<br>
<br>
I then just hinted to him not to mention in the house his having seen<br>
such a person as me, for reasons I would explain to him more at<br>
leisure. And then, for fear of miscarrying, by being seen together, I<br>
tore myself from him with a bleeding heart, and stole up softly to my<br>
room, where I found Ph&oelig;be still fast asleep, and hurrying off my few<br>
clothes, lay down by her, with a mixture of joy and anxiety, that may<br>
be easier conceived than expressed.<br>
<br>
The risks of Mrs. Brown&rsquo;s discovering my purpose, of disappointments,<br>
misery, ruin, all vanished before this new-kindled flame. The seeing,<br>
the touching, the being, if but for a night, with this idol of my fond<br>
virgin heart, appeared to me a happiness above the purchase of my<br>
liberty or life. He might use me ill, let him: he was the master,<br>
happy, too happy, even to receive death at so dear a hand.<br>
<br>
To this purpose were the reflections of the whole day, of which every<br>
minute seemed to me a little eternity. How often did I visit the clock!<br>
nay, was tempted to advance the tedious hand, as if that would have<br>
advanced the time with it! Had those of the house had the least<br>
observations on me, they must have remarked something extraordinary<br>
from the discomposure I could not help betraying; especially when at<br>
dinner mention was made of the charmingest youth having been there, and<br>
stayed breakfast. &ldquo;Oh! he was such a beauty!... I should have died for<br>
him!... they would pull caps for him!...&rdquo; and the like fooleries;<br>
which, however, was throwing oil on a fire I was sorely put to it to<br>
smother the blaze of.<br>
<br>
The fluctuations of my mind, the whole day, produced one good effect:<br>
which was, that, through mere fatigue, I slept tolerably well till five<br>
in the morning, when I got up, and having dressed myself, waited, under<br>
the double tortures of fear and impatience, for the appointed hour. It<br>
came at last, the dear, critical, dangerous hour came; and now,<br>
supported only by the courage love lent me, I ventured, a tip-toe, down<br>
stairs, leaving my box behind, for fear of being surprized with it in<br>
going out.<br>
<br>
I got to the street door, the key whereof was always laid on the chair<br>
by our bed side, in trust with Ph&oelig;be, who having not the least<br>
suspicion of my entertaining any design to go from them (nor, indeed,<br>
had I, but the day before), made no reserve or concealment of it from<br>
me. I opened the door with great ease; love, that emboldened, protected<br>
me too: and now, got safe into the street, I saw my new guardian angel<br>
waiting at a coach door, ready open. How I got to him I know not: I<br>
suppose I flew; but I was in the coach in a trice, and he by the side<br>
of me, with his arms clasped round me, and giving me the kiss of<br>
welcome. The coachman had his orders, and drove to them.<br>
<br>
My eyes were instantly filled with tears, but tears of the most<br>
delicious delight; to find myself in the arms of that beauteous youth,<br>
was a rapture that my little hear swam in; past or future were equally<br>
out of the question with me; the present was as much as all my powers<br>
of life were sufficient to bear the transport of, without fainting. Nor<br>
were the most tender embraces, the most soothing expressions wanting on<br>
his side, to assure me of his love, and of never giving me cause to<br>
repent the bold step I had taken, in throwing myself thus entirely upon<br>
his honour and generosity. But, alas! this was no merit in me, for I<br>
was drove to it by a passion too impetuous for me to resist, and, I did<br>
what I did, because I could not help it.<br>
<br>
In an instant, for time was now annihilated with me, we were landed at<br>
a public house in Chelsea, hospitably commodious for the reception of<br>
duet parties of pleasure, where a breakfast of chocolate was prepared<br>
for us.<br>
<br>
An old jolly stager, who kept it, and understood life perfectly well,<br>
breakfasted with us, and leering archly at me, gave us both joy, and<br>
said, &ldquo;we were well paired, i&rsquo; faith! that a great many gentlemen and<br>
ladies used his house, but he had never seen a handsomer couple... he<br>
was sure I was a fresh piece... I looked so country, so innocent! well<br>
my spouse was a lucky man!...&rdquo; all which, common landlord&rsquo;s cant, not<br>
only pleased and soothed me, but helped to diver my confusion at being<br>
with my new sovereign, whom, the minute approached, I began to fear to<br>
be alone with: a timidity which true love had a greater share in than<br>
even maiden bashful-ness.<br>
<br>
I wished, I doated, I could have died for him; and yet, I know not how,<br>
or why I dreaded the point which had been the object of my fiercest<br>
wishes; my pulses beat fears, amidst a flush of the warmest desires.<br>
This struggle of the passions, however, this conflict betwixt modesty<br>
and lovesick longings, made me burst again into tears; which he took,<br>
as he had done before, only for the remains of concern and emotion at<br>
the suddenness of my change of condition, in committing myself to his<br>
care; and, in consequence of that idea, did and said all that he<br>
thought would most comfort and re-inspirit me.<br>
<br>
After breakfast, Charles (the dear familiar name I must take the<br>
liberty henceforward to distinguish my Adonis by), with a smile full of<br>
meaning, took me gently by the hand, and said: &ldquo;Come, my dear, I will<br>
show you a room that commands a fine prospect over some gardens&rdquo;; and<br>
without waiting for an answer, in which he relieved me extremely, he<br>
led me up into a chamber, airy and lightsome, where all seeing of<br>
prospects was out of the question, except that of a bed, which had all<br>
the air of recommending the room to him.<br>
<br>
Charles had just slipped the bolt of the door, and running, caught me<br>
in his arms, and lifting me from the ground, with his lips glued to<br>
mine, bore me trembling, panting, dying with soft fears and tender<br>
wishes, to the bed; where his impatience would not suffer him to<br>
undress me, more than just unpinning my handkerchief and gowns, and<br>
unlacing my stays.<br>
<br>
My bosom was now bare, and rising in the warmest throbs, presented to<br>
his sight and feeling the firm hard swell of a pair of young breast,<br>
such as may be imagined of a girl not sixteen, fresh out of the<br>
country, and never before handled: but even their pride, whiteness,<br>
fashion, pleasing resistance to the touch, could not bribe his restless<br>
hands from roving; but, giving them the loose, my petticoats and shift<br>
were soon taken up, and their stronger center of attraction laid open<br>
to their tender invasion. My fears, however, made me mechanically close<br>
my thighs; but the very touch of his hand insinuated between them,<br>
disclosed them and opened a way for the main attack.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, I lay fairly exposed to the examination of his eyes<br>
and hands, quiet and unresisting; which confirmed him the opinion he<br>
proceeded so cavalierly upon, that I was no novice in these matters,<br>
since he had taken me out of a common bawdy house, nor had I said one<br>
thing to prepossess him of my virginity; and if I had, he would sooner<br>
have believed that I took him for a cully that would swallow such an<br>
improbability, than that I was still mistress of that darling treasure,<br>
that hidden mine, so eagerly sought after by the men, and which they<br>
never dig for, but to destroy.<br>
<br>
Being now too high wound up to bear a delay, he unbuttoned, and drawing<br>
out the engine of love assaults, drove it currently, as at a ready made<br>
breach... Then! then! for the first time, did I feel that stiff<br>
horn-hard gristle, battering against the tender part; but imagine to<br>
yourself his surprise, when he found, after several vigorous pushes,<br>
which hurt me extremely, that he made not the least impression.<br>
<br>
I complained, but tenderly complained: &ldquo;I could not bear it... indeed<br>
he hurt me!...&rdquo; Still he thought no more, than that being so young, the<br>
largeness of his machine (for few men could dispute size with him) made<br>
all the difficulty; and that possibly I had not been enjoyed by any so<br>
advantageously made in that part as himself: for still, that my virgin<br>
flower was yet un-cropped, never entered into his head, and he would<br>
have thought it idling with time and words, to have questioned me upon<br>
it.<br>
<br>
He tried again, still no admittance, still no penetration; but he had<br>
hurt me yet more, while my extreme love made me bear extreme pain,<br>
almost without a groan. At length, after repeated fruitless trials, he<br>
lay down panting by me, kissed my falling tears, and asked me tenderly<br>
&ldquo;what was the meaning of so much complaining? and if I had not borne it<br>
better from other than I did from him?&rdquo; I answered, with a simplicity<br>
framed to persuade, that he was the first man that ever served me so.<br>
Truth is powerful, and it is not always that we do not believe what we<br>
eagerly wish.<br>
<br>
Charles, already disposed by the evidence, of his senses to think my<br>
pretences to virginity not entirely apocryphal, smothers me with<br>
kisses, begs me, in the name of love, to have a little patience, and<br>
that he wilt be as tender of hurting me as he would be of himself..<br>
<br>
Alas! it was enough I knew his pleasure to submit joyfully to him,<br>
whatever pain I foresaw it would cost, me.<br>
<br>
He now resumes his attempts in more form: first, he put one of the<br>
pillows under me, to give the blank of his aim a more favourable<br>
elevation, and another Under my head, in ease of it; then spreading my<br>
thighs, and placing himself standing betwen them, made them rest upon<br>
his; applying then the point of his machine to the slit, into which he<br>
sought entrance, it was so small, he could scarce assure himself of its<br>
being rightly pointed. He looks, he feels, and satisfies himself: there<br>
driving on with fury, its prodigious stiffness, thus impacted,<br>
wedgelike, breaks the union of those parts, and gained him just the<br>
insertion of the tip of it, lip deep; which being sensible of, he<br>
improved his advantage, and following well his stroke, in a straight<br>
line, forcibly deepens his penetration; but put me to such intolerable<br>
pain, from the separation of the sides of that soft passage by a hard<br>
thick body, I could have screamed out; but, as I was unwilling to alarm<br>
the house, I held in my breath, and crammed my petticoat, which was;<br>
turned up over my face, into my mouth, and bit it through in the agony.<br>
At length, the tender texture of that tract giving way to such fierce<br>
tearing and rending, he pierced something further into me: and now,<br>
outrageous and no longer his own master, but borne headlong away by the<br>
fury and over-mettle of that member, now exerting itself with a kind of<br>
native rage, he breaks in, carries all before him, and one violent<br>
merciless lunge, sent it, imbrued, and reeking with virgin blood, up to<br>
the very hilt in me... Then! then all my resolution deserted me: I<br>
screamed out, and fainted away with the sharpness of the pain; and, as<br>
he told me afterwards, on his drawing out, when emission was over with<br>
him, my thighs were instantly all in a stream of blood, that flowed<br>
from the wounded torn passage.<br>
<br>
When I recovered my senses, I found myself undressed and a-bed, in the<br>
arms of the sweet relenting murderer of my virginity, who hung mourning<br>
tenderly over me, and holding in his hand a cordial, which, coming from<br>
the still dear author of so much pain, I could not refuse; my eyes,<br>
however, moistened with tears, and languishingly turned upon him,<br>
seemed to reproach him with his cruelty, and ask him, if such were the<br>
rewards of love. But Charles, to whom I was now infinitely endeared by<br>
his complete triumph over a maidenhead, where he so little expected to<br>
find one, in tenderness to that pain which he had put me to, in<br>
procuring himself the height of pleasure, smothered his exultation, and<br>
employed himself with so much sweetness, so much warmth, to sooth, to<br>
caress, and comfort me in my soft complainings, which breathed, indeed,<br>
more love than resentment, that I presently drowned all sense of pain<br>
in the pleasure of seeing him, of thinking that I belonged to him: he<br>
who was now the absolute disposer of my happiness, and, in one word, my<br>
fate.<br>
<br>
The sore was, however, too tender, the wound too bleeding fresh, for<br>
Charles&rsquo;s good-nature to put my patience presently to another trial;<br>
but as I could not stir, or walk a-cross the room, he ordered the<br>
dinner to be brought to the bed side, where it could not be otherwise<br>
than my getting down the wing of a fowl, and two or three glasses of<br>
wine, since it was my adored youth who both served, and urged them on<br>
me, with that sweet irresistible authority with which love had invested<br>
him over me.<br>
<br>
After dinner, and everything but the wine was taken away, Charles very<br>
impudently asks a leave, he might read the grant of in my eyes, to come<br>
to bed to me, and accordingly falls to undressing; which I could not<br>
see the progress of without strange emotions of fear and pleasure.<br>
<br>
He is now in bed with me the first time, and in broad day; but when<br>
thrusting up his own shirt and my shift, he laid his naked glowing body<br>
to mine... oh insupportable delight! oh! superhuman rapture! what pain<br>
could stand before a pleasure so transporting? I felt no more the smart<br>
of my wounds below; but, curling round him like the tendril of a vine,<br>
as if I feared any part of him should be untouched or unpressed by me,<br>
I returned his strenuous embraces and kisses with a fervour and gust<br>
only known to true love, and which mere lust never rise to.<br>
<br>
Yes, even at this time, that all the tyranny of the passions is fully<br>
over, and that my veins roll no longer but a cold tranquil stream, the<br>
remembrance of those passages that most affected me in my youth, still<br>
cheers and refreshes me; let me proceed then. My beauteous youth was<br>
now glued to me in all the folds and twists that we could make our<br>
bodies meet in; when, no longer able to rein in the fierceness of<br>
refreshed desires, he gives his steed the head, and gently insinuating<br>
his thighs between mine, stopping my mouth with kisses of humid fire,<br>
makes a fresh eruption, and renewing his thrusts, pierces, tears, and<br>
forces his way up the torn tender folds, that yielded him admission<br>
with a smart little less severe that when the breach was first made I<br>
stifled, however, my cries, and bore him with the passive fortitude of<br>
an heroine; soon his thrusts, more and more furious, cheeks flushed<br>
with a deeper scarlet, his eyes turned up in the fervent fit, some<br>
dying sighs, and an agonizing shudder, announced the approaches of that<br>
ecstatic pleasure, I was yet in too much pain to come in for my share<br>
of.<br>
<br>
Nor was it till after a few enjoyments had numbed and blunted the sense<br>
of the smart, and given me to feel the titillating inspersion of<br>
balsamic sweets, drew from me the delicious return, and brought down<br>
all my passion, that I arrived at excess of pleasure through excess of<br>
pain. But, when successive engagements had broke and inured me, I began<br>
to enter into the true unalloyed relish of that pleasure of pleasures,<br>
when the warm gush darts through all the ravished inwards; what floods<br>
of bliss! what melting transports! what agonies of delight! too fierce,<br>
too mighty for nature to sustain?... well has she therefore, no doubt<br>
provided the relief of a delicious momentary dissolution, the<br>
approaches of which are intimated by a dear delirium, a sweet thrill,<br>
on the point of emitting those liquid sweets, in which enjoyment itself<br>
is drowned, when one gives the languishing stretch out, and die at the<br>
discharge.<br>
<br>
How often, when the rage and tumult of my senses had subsided, after<br>
the melting flow, have I, in a tender meditation, asked myself cooly<br>
the question, if it was in nature for any of its creatures to be so<br>
happy as I was? Or, what were all fears of the consequence, put in the<br>
scale of one night&rsquo;s enjoyment, of any thing so transcendently the<br>
taste of my eyes and heart, as that delicious, fond, matchless youth.<br>
<br>
Thus we spent the whole afternoon, till supper time in a continued<br>
circle of love delights, kissing, turtle-billing, toying, and all the<br>
rest of the feast. At length, supper was served in, before which<br>
Charles had, for I do not know what reason, slipped his clothes on; and<br>
sitting down by the bed side, we made table and tablecloth of the bed<br>
and sheets, whilst he suffered nobody to attend or serve but himself.<br>
He ate with a very good appetite, and seemed charmed to see me eat. For<br>
my part, I was so transported with the comparison of the delights I now<br>
swam in, with the insipidity of all my past scenes of life, that I<br>
thought them sufficiently cheap, at even the price of my ruin, or the<br>
risk of their not lasting. The present possession was all my little<br>
head could find room for.<br>
<br>
We lay together that night, when, after playing repeated prizes of<br>
pleasure, nature, overspent and satisfied, gave us up to the arms of<br>
sleep: those of my dear youth encircled me, the consciousness of which<br>
made even that sleep more delicious.<br>
<br>
Late in the morning I waked, first; and observing my lover slept<br>
profoundly, softly disengaged myself from his arms, scarcely daring to<br>
breathe, for fear of shortening his repose; my cap, my hair, my shift,<br>
were all in disorder, from the rufflings I had undergone; and I took<br>
this opportunity to adjust and set them as well as I could: whilst,<br>
every now and then, looking at the sleeping youth, with inconceivable<br>
fondness and delight, and reflecting on all the pain he had put me to,<br>
tacitly owned that the pleasure had overpaid me for my sufferings.<br>
<br>
It was then broad day. I was sitting up in the bed, the clothes of<br>
which were all tossed, or rolled off, by the unquietness of our<br>
motions, from the sultry heat of the weather; nor could I refuse myself<br>
a pleasure that solicited me so irresistibly, as this fair occasion of<br>
feasting my sight with all those treasures of youthful beauty I had<br>
enjoyed, and which lay now almost entirely naked, his shirt being<br>
trussed up in a perfect wisp, which the warmth of the season and room<br>
made me easy about the consequence of. I hung over him enamoured<br>
indeed! and devoured all his naked charms with only two eyes, when I<br>
could have wished them at least an hundred for the fuller enjoyment of<br>
the gaze.<br>
<br>
Oh! could I paint his figure as I see it now, still present to my<br>
transported imagination! a whole length of an all perfect manly beauty<br>
in full view. Think of a face without a fault, glowing with all the<br>
opening bloom and verdant freshness of an age, in which beauty is of<br>
either sex, and which the first down over his upper lip scarce began to<br>
distinguish.<br>
<br>
The parting of the double ruby pout of his lips seemed to exhale an air<br>
sweeter and purer than what it drew in: ah! what violence did it not<br>
cost me to refrain the so tempted kiss!<br>
<br>
Then a neck exquisitely turned, graved behind and on the sides with<br>
fais hair, playing freely in natural ringlets, connected his head to a<br>
body of the most perfect form, and of the most vigorous contexture, in<br>
which all the strength of manhood was concealed, and softened to<br>
appearance by the delicacy of his complexion, the smoothness of his<br>
skin, and the plumpness of his flesh.<br>
<br>
The platform of his snow white bosom, that was laid out in a manly<br>
proportion, presented, on the vermilion summit of each pap, the idea of<br>
a rose about to blow.<br>
<br>
Nor did his shirt hinder me from observing the symmetry of his limbs,<br>
that exactness of shape, in the fall of it towards the loins, where the<br>
waist ends and the rounding swell of the hips commences; where the<br>
skin, sleek, smooth, and dazzling white, burnishes on; the stretch-over<br>
firm, plump, ripe flesh, that crimped&rsquo; and ran into dimples at the<br>
least pressure, or that the touch could not rest upon, but slid over on<br>
the surface of the most polished ivory.<br>
<br>
His thighs, finely fashioned, and with a florid glossy roundness,<br>
gradually tapering away to the knees, seemed pillars worthy to support<br>
that beauteous frame at the bottom of which I could not, without some<br>
remains of terror, some tender emotions too, fix my eyes on that<br>
terrible machine, which had, not long before, with such fury broke<br>
into, torn, and almost ruined those soft, tender parts of mine, that<br>
had not yet done smarting with the effects of its rage; but behold it<br>
now! crest fallen, reclining its half-caped vermilion head over one of<br>
his thighs, quiet, pliant, and to all appearances incapable of the<br>
mischiefs and cruelty it had committed. Then the beautiful growth of<br>
the hair, in short and soft curls round its roots, its whiteness,<br>
branched veins, the supple softness of the shaft, as it lay<br>
foreshortened, rolled and shrunk up into a squat thickness, languid,<br>
and borne up from between his thighs, by its globular appendage, that<br>
wondrous treasure bag of nature&rsquo;s sweets, which revelled round, and<br>
pursed up in the only wrinkles that are known to please, perfected the<br>
prospect, and altogether formed the most interesting moving picture in<br>
nature, and surely infinitely superior to those nudities furnished by<br>
the painters, statuaries, or any art, which are purchased at immense<br>
prices; whilst the sight of them in actual life is scarce sovereignly<br>
tasted by any but the few whom nature has endowed with a fire of<br>
imagination, warmly pointed by a truth of judgment to the spring-head,<br>
the originals of beauty, of nature&rsquo;s unequalled composition, above all<br>
the imitations of art, or the reach of wealth to pay their price.<br>
<br>
But every thing must have an end. A motion made by this angelic youth,<br>
in the listlessness of goingoff sleep, replaced his shirt and the bed<br>
clothes in a posture that shut up that treasury from longer view.<br>
<br>
I lay down then, and carrying my hands to that part of me in which the<br>
objects just seen had begun to raise a mutiny, that prevailed over the<br>
smart of them, my fingers now opened themselves an easy passage; but<br>
long I had not time to consider the wide difference there, between the<br>
maid and the now finished woman, before Charles waked, and turning<br>
towards me, kindly enquired how I had rested? and, scarce giving me<br>
time to answer, imprinted on my lips one of his burning rapture kisses,<br>
which darted a flame to my heart, that from thence radiated to every<br>
part of me; and presently, as if he had proudly meant revenge for the<br>
survey I had smuggled of all his naked beauties, he spurns off the bed<br>
clothes, and trussing up my shift as high as it would go, took his turn<br>
to feast his eyes on all the gifts nature had bestowed on my person;<br>
his busy hands, too, ranged intemperately over every part of me. The<br>
delicious austerity and hardness of my yet unripe budding breasts, the<br>
whiteness and firmness of my flesh, the freshness and regularity of my<br>
features, the harmony of my limbs, all seemed to confirm him in his<br>
satisfaction with his bargain; but when curious to explore the havock<br>
he had made in the centre of his over fierce attack, he not only<br>
directed his hands there, but with a pillow put under, placed me<br>
favourably for his wanton purpose of inspection. Then, who can express<br>
the fire his eyes glistened, his hands glowed with! whilst sighs of<br>
pleasure, and tender broken exclamations, were all the praises he could<br>
utter. By this time his machine, stiffly risen at me, gave me to see it<br>
in its highest state and bravery. He feels it himself, seems pleased at<br>
its condition, and, smiling loves and graces, seizes one of my hands,<br>
and carries it, with gentle compulsion, to this pride of nature, and<br>
its richest master piece.<br>
<br>
I, struggling faintly, could not help feeling what I could not grasp, a<br>
column of the whitest ivory, beautifully streaked with blue veins, and<br>
carrying, fully un-capt, a head of the liveliest vermilion: no horn<br>
could be harder or stiffer; yet no velvet more smooth or delicious to<br>
the touch. Presently he guided my hand lower, to that part in which<br>
nature, and pleasure keep their stores in concert, so aptly fastened<br>
and hung on to the root of their first instrument and minister, that<br>
not improperly he might be styled their purse-bearer too: there he made<br>
me feel distinctly, through their soft cover, the contents, a pair of<br>
roundish balls, that seemed to play within, and elude all pressure, but<br>
the tenderest, from without.<br>
<br>
But now this visit of my soft, warm hand, in those so sensible parts,<br>
had put every thing into such ungovernable fury, disdaining all further<br>
preluding, and taking advantage of my commodious posture, he made the<br>
storm fall where I scarce patiently expected, and where he was sure to<br>
lay it: presently, then, I felt the stiff intersection betwen the<br>
yielding, divided lips of the wound, now open for life; where the<br>
narrowness no longer put me to intolerable pain, and afforded my lover<br>
no more difficulty than what heightened his pleasure, in the strict<br>
embrace of that tender, warm sheath, round the instrument it was so<br>
delicately adjusted to, and which now cased home, so gorged me with<br>
pleasure, that it perfectly suffocated me and took away my breath; then<br>
the killing thrusts! the unnumbered kisses! every one of which was a<br>
joy inexpressible; and that joy lost in a crowd of yet greater blisses!<br>
But this was a disorder too violent in nature to last long: the<br>
vessels, so stirred and intensely heated, soon boiled over, and for<br>
that time put out the fire; meanwhile all this dalliance and disport<br>
had so far consumed the morning, that it became a kind of necessity to<br>
lay breakfast and dinner into one.<br>
<br>
In our calmer intervals Charles gave the following account of himself,<br>
every tittle of which was true. He was the only son of a father, who,<br>
having a small post in the revenue, rather overlived his income, and<br>
had given this young gentleman a very slender education: no profession<br>
had he bred him up to, but designed to provide for him in the army, by<br>
purchasing him an ensign&rsquo;s commission, that is to say, provided he<br>
could raise the money, or procure it by interest, either of which<br>
clauses was rather to be wished than hoped for by him. On no better a<br>
plan, however, had his improvident father suffered this youth, a youth<br>
of great promise, to run up to the age of manhood, or near it at least,<br>
in next to idleness; and had, besides, taken no sort of pains to give<br>
him even the common premonitions against the vices of the town, and the<br>
dangers of all sorts which wait the unexperienced and unwary in it. He<br>
lived at home, and at discretion with his father, who himself kept a<br>
mistress; and for the rest, provided Charles did not ask him for money,<br>
he was indolently kind to him: he might lie out when he pleased, any<br>
excuse would serve, and even his reprimands were so slight, that they<br>
carried with them rather an air of connivance at the fault, than any<br>
serious control or constraint. But, to supply his calls for money,<br>
Charles, whose mother was dead, had, by her side, a grandmother, who<br>
doated upon him. She had a considerable annuity to live on, and very<br>
regularly parted with every shilling she could spare, to this darling<br>
of her&rsquo;s, to the no little heart-burn of his father; who was vexed, not<br>
that she, by this means, fed his son&rsquo;s extravagance, but that she<br>
preferred Charles to himself; and we shall too soon see what a fatal<br>
turn such a mercenary jealousy could operate on the breast of a father.<br>
<br>
Charles was, however, by the means of his grandmother&rsquo;s lavish<br>
fondness, very sufficiently enabled to keep a mistress, so easily<br>
contented as my love made me; and my good fortune, for such I must ever<br>
call it, threw me in his way, in the manner above related, just as he<br>
was on the look-out for one.<br>
<br>
As to temper, the even sweetness of it made him seem born for domestic<br>
happiness: tender, naturally polite, and gentle-manner&rsquo;d; it could<br>
never be his fault, if ever jars, or animosities ruffled a calm he was<br>
so qualified every way to maintain or restore. Without those great or<br>
shining qualities that constitute a genius, or are fit to make a noise<br>
in the world, he had all those humble ones that compose the softer<br>
social merit: plain common sense, set off with every grace of modesty<br>
and good nature, made him, if not admired, what is much happier:<br>
universally beloved and esteemed. But, as nothing but the beauties of<br>
his person had at first attracted my regard and fixed my passion,<br>
neither was I then a judge of the internal merit, which I had<br>
afterwards full occasion to discover, and which, perhaps, in that<br>
season of giddiness and levity, would have touched my heart very<br>
little, had it been lodged in a person less the delight of my eyes, and<br>
idol of my senses. But to return to our situation.<br>
<br>
After dinner, which we ate a-bed in most voluptuous disorder, Charles<br>
got up, and taking a passionate leave of me for a few hours, went to<br>
town, where concerting matters with a young sharp lawyer, they went<br>
together to my late venerable mistress&rsquo;s, from whence I had, but the<br>
day before, made my elopement, and with whom he was determined to<br>
settle accounts, in a manner that should cut off all after reckonings<br>
from that quarter.<br>
<br>
Accordingly they went; but by the way, the Templar, his friend, on<br>
thinking over Charles&rsquo;s information, saw reason to give their visit<br>
another turn, and, instead of offering satisfaction, to demand it.<br>
<br>
On being let in, the girls of the house flocked round Charles, whom<br>
they knew, and from the earlyness of my escape, and their perfect<br>
ignorance of his ever having so much as seen me, not having the least<br>
suspicion of his being accessory to my flight, they were, in their way,<br>
making up to him; and as to his companion, they took him probably for a<br>
fresh cully. But the Templar soon checked their forwardness, by<br>
enquiring for the old lady, with whom he said, with a grave-like<br>
countenance, that he had some business to settle.<br>
<br>
Madam was immediately sent for down, and the ladies being desired to<br>
clear the room, the lawyer asked her, severely, if she did know, or had<br>
not decoyed, under pretence of hiring as a servant, a young girl, just<br>
come out of the country, called Frances or Fanny Hill, describing me<br>
withal as particularly as he could from Charlie&rsquo;s description.<br>
<br>
It is peculiar to vice to tremble at the enquiries of justice; and Mrs.<br>
Brown, whose conscience was not entirely clear upon my account, as<br>
knowing as she was of the town as hackneyed as she was in bluffing<br>
through all the dangers of her vocation, could not help being alarmed<br>
at the questions, especially when he went on to talk of a Justice of<br>
peace, Newgate, the Old Bailey, indictments for keeping a disorderly<br>
house, pillory, carting, and the whole process of that nature. She,<br>
who, it is likely, imagined I had lodged an information against her<br>
house, looked extremely blank, and began to make a thousand<br>
protestations and excuses. However, to abridge, they brought away<br>
triumphantly my box of things, which, had she not ben under an awe, she<br>
might have disputed with them; and not only that, but a clearance and<br>
discharge of any demands on the house, at the expense of no more than a<br>
bowl of arrack-punch, the treat of which, together with the choice of<br>
the house conveniences, was offered and not accepted. Charles all the<br>
time acted the chance companion of the lawyer, who had brought him<br>
there, as he knew the house, and appeared in no wise interested in the<br>
issue; but he had the collateral pleasure of hearing all that I told<br>
him verified, as far as the bawd&rsquo;s fears would give her leave to enter<br>
into my history, which, if one may guess by the composition she so<br>
readily came into, were not small.<br>
<br>
Ph&oelig;be, my kind tutoress Ph&oelig;be, was at the time gone out, perhaps in<br>
search of me, or their cooked-up story had not, it is probable, passed<br>
smoothly.<br>
<br>
This negociation had, however, taken up some time, which would have<br>
appeared much longer to me, left as I was, in a strange house, if the<br>
landlady, a motherly sort of a woman, to whom Charles had liberally<br>
recommended me, had not come up and borne me company. We drank tea, and<br>
her chat helped to pass away the time very agreeably, since he was our<br>
theme; but as the evening deepened, and the hour set for his return was<br>
elapsed, I could not dispel the gloom of impatience, and tender fears<br>
which gathered upon me, and which our timid sex are apt to feel in<br>
proportion to their love.<br>
<br>
Long, however, I did not suffer: the sight of him over-paid me; and the<br>
soft reproach I had prepared for him, expired before it reached my<br>
lips.<br>
<br>
I was still a-bed, yet unable to use my legs otherwise than awkwardly,<br>
and Charles flew to me, catches me in his arms, raised and extending<br>
mine to meet his dear embrace, and gives me an account, interrupted by<br>
many a sweet parenthesis of kisses, of the success of his measures.<br>
<br>
I could not help laughing at the fright of the old woman had been put<br>
into, which my ignorance, and indeed my want of innocence, had far from<br>
prepared me from bespeaking. She had, it seems, apprehended that I fled<br>
the shelter to some relation I had recollected in town, on my dislike<br>
of their ways and proceedings towards me, and that this application<br>
came from thence; for, as Charles had rightly judged, not one neighbour<br>
had, at that still hour, seen the circumstance of my escape into the<br>
coach, or, at least, noticed him; neither had any in the house, the<br>
least hint of suspicion of my having spoken to him, much less of my<br>
having clapt up such a sudden bargain with a perfect stranger, thus the<br>
greatest improbability is not always what we should most mistrust.<br>
<br>
We supped with all the gaiety of two young giddy creatures at the top<br>
of their desires; and as I had given up to Charles the whole charge of<br>
my future happiness, I thought of nothing beyond the exquisite pleasure<br>
of possessing him.<br>
<br>
He came to bed in due time; and this second night, the pain being<br>
pretty well over, I tasted, in full draught, all the transports of<br>
perfect enjoyment: I swam, I bathed in bliss, till both fell asleep,<br>
through the natural consequences of satisfied desires, and appeased<br>
flames; nor did we wake but to renewed raptures.<br>
<br>
Thus, making the most of love, and life did we stay in this lodging in<br>
Chelsea about ten days; in which time Charles took care to give his<br>
excursions from home a favourable gloss, and to keep his footing with<br>
his fond indulgent grand-mother, from whom he drew constant and<br>
sufficient supplies for the charge I was to him, and which was very<br>
trifling, in comparison with his former less regular course of<br>
pleasure.<br>
<br>
Charles removed me then to a private ready furnished lodging in D....<br>
street, St. James&rsquo;s, where he paid half a guinea a week for two rooms<br>
and a closet on the second floor, which he had been some time looking<br>
out for, and was more convenient for the frequency of his visits, than<br>
where he had at first placed me, in a house, which I cannot say but I<br>
left with regret, as it was infinitely endeared to me by the first<br>
possession of my Charles, and the circumstance of losing, there, that<br>
jewel, which can never be twice lost. The landlord, however, had no<br>
reason to complain of any thing, but of a procedure in Charles too<br>
liberal not to make him regret the loss of us.<br>
<br>
Arrived at our new lodging, I remember I thought them extremely fine,<br>
though ordinary enough, even at that price; but, had it been a dungeon<br>
that Charles had brought me to, his presence would have made a little<br>
Versailles.<br>
<br>
The landlady, Mrs. Jones, waited on us to our apartment, and with great<br>
volubility of tongue, explained to us all its conveniences: &ldquo;that her<br>
own maid should wait on us... that the best of quality had lodged at<br>
her house... that her first floor was let to a foreign secretary of an<br>
embassy, and his lady... that I looked like a very good natured<br>
lady...&rdquo; At the word lady, I blushed out of flattered vanity: this was<br>
strong for a girl of my condition; for though Charles had the<br>
precaution of dressing me in a less tawdry flaunting style than were<br>
the clothes I escaped to him in, and of passing me for his wife, that<br>
she had secretly married, and kept private (the old story) on account<br>
of his friends, I dare swear this appeared extremely apocryphal to a<br>
woman who knew the town so well as she did; but that was the least of<br>
her concern: it was impossible to be less scruple-ridden than she was;<br>
and the advantage of letting her rooms being her sole object, the truth<br>
itself would have far from scandalized her, or broke her bargain.<br>
<br>
A sketch of her picture, and personal history, will dispose you to<br>
account for the part she is to act in my concern.<br>
<br>
She was about forty six years old, tall, meagre, red-haired, with one<br>
of those trivial ordinary faces you meet with every where, and go about<br>
unheeded and un-mentioned. In her youth she had been kept by a<br>
gentleman, who, dying, left her forty pounds a year during her life, in<br>
consideration of a daughter he had by her: which daughter, at the age<br>
of seventeen, she sold, for not a very considerable sum neither, to a<br>
gentleman who was going on envoy abroad, and took his purchase with<br>
him, where he used her with the utmost tenderness, and it is thought,<br>
was secretly married to her: but had constantly made a point of her not<br>
keeping up the least correspondence with a mother base enough to make a<br>
market of her own flesh and blood. However, as she had not nature, nor,<br>
indeed, any passion but that of money, this gave her no further<br>
uneasiness, then, as she thereby lost a handle of squeezing presents,<br>
or other after advantages, out of the bargain. Indifferent then, by<br>
nature of constitution, to every other pleasure but that of increasing<br>
the lump, by any means whatever, she commenced a kind of private<br>
procuress, for which she was not amiss fitted, by her grave decent<br>
appearance, and sometimes did a job in the match-making way; in short,<br>
there was, nothing that appeared to her under the shape of gain, that<br>
she would not have undertaken. She knew most of the ways of the town,<br>
having not only herself been upon, but kept up constant intelligences<br>
in promoting a harmony between the two sexes, in private pawn-broking,<br>
and other profitable secrets. She rented the house she lived in, and<br>
made the most of it, by letting it out in lodgings; though she was<br>
worth, at least, near three or four thousand pounds, she would not<br>
allow herself even the necessaries, of life, and pinned her subsistence<br>
entirely on what she could squeeze out of her lodgers.<br>
<br>
When she saw such a young pair come under her roof, her immediate<br>
notions, doubtless, were how she should make the most money of us, by<br>
every means that money might be made, and which, she rightly judged,<br>
our situations and inexperience would soon beget her occasions of.<br>
<br>
In this hopeful sanctuary, and under the clutches of this harpy, did we<br>
pitch our residence. It will not be might material to you, or very<br>
pleasant to me, to enter into a detail of all the petty cut-throat ways<br>
and means with which she used to fleece us; all which Charles<br>
indolently chose to bear with, rather than take the trouble of<br>
removing, the difference of expense being scarce attended to by a young<br>
gentleman who had no ideas of stint, or even economy, and a raw country<br>
girl who knew nothing of the matter.<br>
<br>
Here, however, under the wings of my sovereignly beloved, did the most<br>
delicious hours of my life flow on; my Charles I had, and, in him,<br>
every thing my fond heart could wish or desire. He carried me to plays,<br>
operas, masquerades, and every diversion of the town; all which pleased<br>
me, indeed, but pleased me infinitely the more for his being with me,<br>
and explaining every thing to me, and enjoying perhaps, the natural<br>
impressions of surprise and admiration, which such sights, at the<br>
first, never fail to excite in a country girl, new to the delights of<br>
them; but to me, they sensibly proved the power and dominion of the<br>
sole passion of my heart over me, a passion in which soul and body were<br>
concentered, and left me no room for any other relish of life but love.<br>
<br>
As to the men I saw at those places, or at any other, they suffered so<br>
much in the comparison my eyes made of them with my all-perfect Adonis,<br>
that I had not the infidelity even of one wandering thought to reproach<br>
myself with upon his account. He was the universe to me, and all that<br>
was not him, was nothing to me.<br>
<br>
My love, in fine, was so excessive, that is arrived at annihilating<br>
every suggestion or kindling spark of jealousy; for, one idea only,<br>
tending that way, gave me such exquisite torment, that my self-love,<br>
and dread of worse than death, made me for ever renounce and defy it:<br>
nor had I, indeed, occasion; for, were I to enter here on the recital<br>
of several instances wherein Charles sacrificed to me women of much<br>
greater importance than I dare hint (which, considering his form, was<br>
no such wonder), I might, indeed, give you full proof of his unshaken<br>
constancy to me; but would not you accuse me of warming up against a<br>
feast, which my vanity ought long ago to have been satisfied with?<br>
<br>
In our cessations from active pleasure, Charles framed himself one, in<br>
instructing me, as far as his own lights reached, in a great many<br>
points of life, that I was, in consequence of my no-education,<br>
perfectly ignorant of: nor did I suffer one word to fall in vain from<br>
the mouth of my lovely teacher: I hung on every syllable he uttered,<br>
and received, as oracles, all he said; whilst kisses were all the<br>
interruption I could not refuse myself the pleasure of admitting, from<br>
lips that breathed more than Arabian sweetness, I was in a little time<br>
enabled, by the progress I had made, to prove the deep regard I had<br>
paid to all that he had said to me: repeating it to him almost word for<br>
word; and to shew that I was not entirely the parrot, but that I<br>
reflected upon, that I entered into it, I joined my own comments, and<br>
asked him questions of explanation.<br>
<br>
My country accent, and the rusticity of my gait, manners, and<br>
deportment, began now sensibly to wear off: so quick was my<br>
observation, and so efficacious my desire of growing every day worthier<br>
of his heart.<br>
<br>
As to money, though, he brought me constantly all he received, it was<br>
with difficulty he even got me to give it room in my bureau; and what<br>
clothes I had, he could prevail on me to accept of on no other foot,<br>
than that of pleasing him by the greater neatness in my dress, beyond<br>
which I had no ambition. I could have made a pleasure of the greatest<br>
toil, and worked my fingers to the bone, with joy, to have supported<br>
him: guess, then, if I could harbour any idea of being burthensome to<br>
him, and this disinterested turn in me was so unaffected, so much the<br>
dictate of my heart, that Charles could not but feel it: and if he did<br>
not love me as much as I did him (which was the constant and only<br>
matter of sweet contention between us), he managed so, at least, as to<br>
give me the satisfaction of believing it impossible for man to be more<br>
tender, more true, more faithful than he was.<br>
<br>
Our landlady, Mrs. Jones, came frequently up to my apartment, from<br>
whence I never stirred on any pretext without Charles; nor was it long<br>
before she wormed out, without much art, the secret of our having<br>
cheated the church of a ceremony, and, in course, of the terms we lived<br>
together upon; a circumstance which far from displeased her,<br>
considering the designs she had upon me, and which, alas! she will have<br>
too soon, room to carry into execution. But in the meantime, her own<br>
experience of life let her see, that any attempt, however indirect or<br>
disguised, to divert or break, at least presently, so strong a cement<br>
of hearts as ours was, could only end in losing two lodgers, of whom<br>
she had made very competent advantages, if either of us came to smoke<br>
her commission, for a commission she had from one of her customers,<br>
either to debauch, or get me away from my keeper at any rate.<br>
<br>
But the barbarity of my fate soon saved her the task of disuniting us.<br>
I had now been eleven months with this life of my life, which had<br>
passed in one continued rapid stream of delight: but nothing so violent<br>
was ever made to last. I was about three months gone with a child by<br>
him, a circumstances would have added to his tenderness, had he ever<br>
left me room to believe it could receive an addition, when the mortal,<br>
the unexpected blow of separation fell upon us. I shall gallop<br>
post-over the particulars, which I shudder yet to think of, and cannot;<br>
to this instant, reconcile myself how, or by what means I could<br>
out-live it.<br>
<br>
Two live-long days had I lingered through without hearing from him, I<br>
who breathed, who existed but in him, and had never yet seen<br>
twenty-four hours pass without seeing or hearing from him. The third<br>
day my impatience was so strong, my alarms had been so severe, that I<br>
perfectly sickened with them; and being unable to support the shock<br>
longer, I sunk upon the bed, and ringing for Mrs. Jones, who had far<br>
from comforted me under my anxieties, she came up, and I had scarce<br>
breath and spirit enough to find words to beg of her, if she would save<br>
my life, to fall upon some means of finding out, instantly, what was<br>
become of its only prop and comfort. She pitied me in a way that rather<br>
sharpened my affliction than suspended it, and went out upon this<br>
commission.<br>
<br>
For she had but to go to Charles&rsquo;s house, who lived but an easy<br>
distance, in one of the streets that run into Covent Garden. There she<br>
went into a public house, and from thence sent for a mid servant, whose<br>
name I had given her, as the properest to inform her.<br>
<br>
The maid readily came, and as readily, when Mrs. Jones enquired of her<br>
what had become of Mr. Charles, or whether he was gone out of town,<br>
acquainted her with the disposal of her master&rsquo;s son, which, the very<br>
day after, was no secret to the servants. Such sure measures had he<br>
taken, for the most cruel punishment of his child for having more<br>
interest with his grandmother than he had, though he made use of a<br>
pretence, plausible enough, to get rid of him in this secret abrupt<br>
manner, for fear her fondness should have interposed a bar to his<br>
leaving England, and proceeding on a voyage he had concerted for him;<br>
which pretext was, that it was indispensably necessary to secure a<br>
considerable inheritance that devolved to him by the death of a rich<br>
merchant (his own brother) at one of the factories in the South Seas,<br>
of which he had lately received advice, together with a copy of the<br>
will.<br>
<br>
In consequence of which resolution, to send away his son, he had,<br>
unknown to him, made the necessary preparations for fitting him out,<br>
struck a bargain with the captain of a ship, whose punctual execution<br>
of his orders he had secured, by his interest with his principal owners<br>
and patron; and, in short, concerted his measures so secretly, and<br>
effectually, that whilst the son thought he was going down to the<br>
river, that would take him a few hours, he was stopt on board of a<br>
ship, debarred from writing, and more strictly watched than a State<br>
criminal.<br>
<br>
Thus was the idol of my soul torn from me, and forced on a long voyage,<br>
without taking leave of one friend, or receiving one line of comfort,<br>
except a dry explanation and instructions, from his father, how to<br>
proceed when he should arrive at his destined port, enclosing, withal,<br>
some letters of recommendation to a factor there: all these particulars<br>
I did not learn minutely till some time after.<br>
<br>
The maid, at the same time, added, that she was sure this usage of her<br>
sweet young master would be the death of his grand-mamma, as indeed it<br>
proved true; for the old lady, on hearing it, did not survive the news<br>
a whole month, and as her fortune consisted in an annuity, out of which<br>
she had laid up no reserves, she left nothing worth mentioning to her<br>
so fatally envied darling, but absolutely refused to see his father<br>
before she died.<br>
<br>
When Mrs. Jones returned, and I observed her looks, they seemed so<br>
unconcerned, and even nearest to pleased, that I half flattered myself<br>
she was going to set my tortured heart at ease, by bringing me good<br>
news; but this, indeed, was a cruel delusion of hope: the barbarian,<br>
with all the coolness imaginable, stabs me to the heart, in telling me,<br>
succinctly, that he was sent away, at least, on a four years&rsquo; voyage<br>
(here she stretched maliciously), and that I could not expect, in<br>
reason, ever to see him again: and all this with such pregnant<br>
circumstances, that I could not escape giving them credit, as they<br>
were, indeed, too true!<br>
<br>
She had hardly finished her report before I fainted away, and after<br>
several successive fits, all the while wild and senseless, I miscarried<br>
of the dear pledge of my Charles&rsquo;s love; but the wretched never die<br>
when it is fittest they should die, and women are hard-lived! to a<br>
proverb.<br>
<br>
The cruel and interested care taken to recover me, saved an odious<br>
life: which, instead of the happiness and joys it had overflower in,<br>
all of a sudden presented no view before me of any thing but the depth<br>
of misery, horror, and the sharpest affliction.<br>
<br>
Thus I lay six weeks, in the struggles of youth and constitution,<br>
against the friendly efforts of death, which I constantly invoked to my<br>
relief and deliverance, but which proved too weak for my wish. I<br>
recovered at length, but into a state of stupefaction and despair, that<br>
threatened me with the loss of my senses, and a mad house.<br>
<br>
Time, however, that great comforter in ordinary, began to assuage the<br>
violence of my suffering, and to numb my feeling of them. My health<br>
returned to me, though I still retained an air of grief, dejection, and<br>
languor, which taking off from the ruddiness of my country complexion,<br>
rendered it rather more delicate and affecting.<br>
<br>
The landlady had all this while officiously provided, and seen that I<br>
wanted for nothing: and as soon as she saw me retrieved into a<br>
condition of answering her purpose, one day, after we had dined<br>
together, she congratulated me on my recovery, the merit of which she<br>
took entirely to herself, and all this by way of introduction to a most<br>
terrible, and scurvy epilogue: &ldquo;You are now,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;Miss Fanny,<br>
tolerably well, and you are very welcome to stay in these lodgings as;<br>
long as you please! you see I have asked you for nothing this long<br>
time, but truly I have a call to make up a sum of money, which must be<br>
answered.&rdquo; And, with that, presents me with a bill of arrears for rent,<br>
diet, apothecaries&rsquo; charges, nurse, etc., sum total twenty-three<br>
pounds, seventeen and six-pence: towards discharging of which I had not<br>
in the world (which she well knew) more than seven guineas, left by<br>
chance, of my dear Charles&rsquo;s common stock, with me. At the same time,<br>
she desired me to tell her what course I would take for payment. I<br>
burst out into a flood of tears, and told her my condition: that I<br>
would sell what few clothes I had, and that, for the rest, would pay<br>
her as soon as possible. But my distress, being favourable to her view,<br>
only stiffened her the more.<br>
<br>
She told me, very cooly, that &ldquo;she was indeed sorry for my misfortunes,<br>
but that she must do herself justice, though it would go to the very<br>
heart of her to send such a tender young creature to prison....&rdquo; At the<br>
word &ldquo;prison!&rdquo; every drop of my blood chilled, and my fright acted so<br>
strongly upon me, that, turning as pale and faint as a criminal at the<br>
first sight of his place of execution, I was on the point of swooning.<br>
My landlady, who wanted only to terrify me to a certain point, and not<br>
to throw me into a state of body inconsistent with her designs upon it,<br>
began to sooth me again, and told me, in a tone composed to more pity<br>
and gentleness, that &ldquo;it would be my own fault, if she was forced to<br>
proceed to such extremities; but she believed there was a friend to be<br>
found in the world, who would make up matters to both our<br>
satisfactions, and that she would bring him to drink tea with us that<br>
very afternoon, when she hoped we would come to a right understanding<br>
in our affairs.&rdquo; To all this, not a word of answer; I sat mute,<br>
confounded, terrified.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Jones, however, judging rightly that it was time to strike while<br>
the impressions were so strong upon me, left me to myself and to all<br>
the terrors of an imagination, wounded to death by the idea of going to<br>
prison, and, from a principle of self-preservation, snatching at every<br>
glimpse of redemption from it.<br>
<br>
In this situation I sat near half an hour, swallowed up in grief and<br>
despair, when my landlady came in, and observing a death-like dejection<br>
in my countenance, still in pursuance of her plan, put on a false pity,<br>
and bidding me be of good heart: &ldquo;Things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;would be but my<br>
own friend&rdquo;; and closed with telling me &ldquo;she had brought a very<br>
honourable gentleman to drink tea with me, who would give me the best<br>
advice how to get rid of all my troubles.&rdquo; Upon which, without waiting<br>
for a reply, she goes out, and returns with this very honourable<br>
gentleman, whose very honourable procuress she had been, on this, as<br>
well as other occasions.<br>
<br>
The gentleman, on his entering the room, made me a very civil bow,<br>
which I had scarce strength, or presence of mind enough to return a<br>
curtsey to; when the landlady, taking upon her to do all the honours of<br>
the first interview (for I had never, that I remember, seen the<br>
gentleman before), sets a chair for him, another for herself. All this<br>
while not a word on either side; a stupid stare was all the face I<br>
could put on this strange visit.<br>
<br>
The tea was made, and the landlady, unwilling, I suppose, to lose any<br>
time, observing my silence and shyness before this entire stranger:<br>
&ldquo;Come, Miss Fanny,&rdquo; says she, in a coarse familiar style, and tone of<br>
authority, &ldquo;hold up your head, child, and do not let sorrow spoil that<br>
pretty face of yours. What! sorrows are only for a time; come, be free,<br>
here is a worthy gentleman who has heard of your misfortunes, and is<br>
willing to serve you; you must be better acquainted with him, do not<br>
you now stand upon your punctilios, and this and that, but make your<br>
market while you may.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At this so delicate, and eloquent harangue, the gentleman, who saw I<br>
looked frighted and amazed, and, indeed, incapable of answering, took<br>
her up for breaking things in so abrupt a manner, as rather to shock<br>
than incline me to an acceptance of the good he intended me then,<br>
addressing himself to me, told me &ldquo;he was perfectly acquainted with my<br>
whole story, and every circumstance of my distress which he owned was a<br>
cruel plunge for one of my youth and beauty to fall into.... that he<br>
had long taken a liking to my person, for which he appealed to Mrs.<br>
Jones, there present; but finding me so deeply engaged to another, he<br>
had lost all hopes of succeeding, till he had heard the sudden reverse<br>
of fortune that had happened to me, on which he had given particular<br>
orders to my landlady to see that I should want for nothing; and that,<br>
had he not been forced abroad to the Hague, on affairs he could not<br>
refuse himself to, he would himself have attended me during my<br>
sickness;... that on his return, which was the day before, he had, on<br>
learning my recovery, desired my landlady&rsquo;s good offices to introduce<br>
him to me, and was as angry, at least, as I was shocked, at the manner<br>
in which she had conducted herself towards obtaining him that<br>
happiness; but, that to show me how much he disdained her procedure,<br>
and how far he was from taking any ungenerous advantage of my<br>
situation, and from exacting any security for my gratitude, he would<br>
before my face, that instant, discharge my debt entirely to my<br>
landlady, and give me her receipt in full; after which I should be at<br>
liberty either to reject or grant his suit, as he was much above<br>
putting any force upon my inclinations.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Whilst he was exposing his sentiments to me, I ventured just to look up<br>
to him, and observed his figure, which was that of a very well-looking<br>
gentleman, well made, of about forty, dressed in a suit of plain<br>
clothes, with a large diamond ring on one of his fingers, the lustre of<br>
which played in my eyes as he waved his hand in talking, and raised my<br>
notions of his importance. In short, he might pass for what is commonly<br>
called a comely black man, with an air of distinction natural to his<br>
birth and condition.<br>
<br>
To all his speeches, however, I answered only in tears that flower<br>
plentifully to my relief, and choking up my voice, excused me from<br>
speaking, very luckily, for I should not have known what to say.<br>
<br>
The sight, however, moved him, as he afterwards told me, irresistibly,<br>
and by way of giving me some reason to be less powerfully afflicted, he<br>
drew out his purse, and calling for pen and ink, which the landlady was<br>
prepared for, paid her every farthing of her demand, independent of a<br>
liberal gratification which was to follow unknown to me, and taking a<br>
receipt in full, very tenderly forced me to secure it, by guiding my<br>
hand, which he had thrust it into, so as to make me passively put it<br>
into my pocket.<br>
<br>
Still I continued in a state of stupidity, or melancholic despair, as<br>
my spirits could not yet recover from the violent shocks that they had<br>
received; and the accommodating landlady had actually left the room,<br>
and me alone with this strange gentleman, before I had observed it, and<br>
then I observed it without alarm, for I was now lifeless, and<br>
indifferent to every thing.<br>
<br>
The gentleman, however, no novice in affairs of this sort, drew near<br>
me; and, under the pretence of comforting me, first with his<br>
handkerchief dried my tears as they ran down my cheeks: presently he<br>
ventured to kiss me on my part, neither resistance nor compliance. I<br>
sat stock still; and now looking on myself as bought by the payment<br>
that had been transacted before me.<br>
<br>
I did not care what became of my wretched body: and wanting life,<br>
spirits, or courage to oppose the least struggle, even that of the<br>
modesty of my sex, I suffered, tamely, whatever the gentleman pleased;<br>
who proceeding insensibly from freedom to freedom, insinuating his hand<br>
between my handkerchief and bosom, which he handled at discretion:<br>
finding thus no repulse, and that every thing favoured, beyond<br>
expectation, the completion of his desires, he took me in his arms, and<br>
bore me, without life or motion, to the bed, on which laying me gently<br>
downed, and having me at what advantage he pleased, I did not so much<br>
as know what he was about, till recovering from a trance of lifeless<br>
insensibility, I found him buried in me, whilst I lay passive and<br>
innocent of the least sensations of pleasure: a death-cold corpse could<br>
scarce have less life or sense in it. As soon as he had thus pacified a<br>
passion which had too little respected the condition I was in, he got<br>
off, and after recomposing the disorder of my clothes, employed himself<br>
with the utmost tenderness to calm the transports of remorse and<br>
madness at myself, with which I was seized, too late, I confess, for<br>
having suffered on that bed, the embraces of an utter stranger I tore<br>
my hair, wrung my hands, and beat my breast like a mad woman. But when<br>
my new master, for in that light I then viewed him, applied himself to<br>
appease me, as my whole rage was levelled at myself, no part of which I<br>
thought myself permitted to aim at him, I begged of him with more<br>
submission than anger, to leave me alone, that I might, at least, enjoy<br>
my affliction in quiet. This he positively refused, for fear, as he<br>
pretended, I should do myself a mischief. Violent passions seldom last<br>
long, and those of women least of any. A dead still calm succeeded this<br>
storm, which ended in a profuse shower of tears.<br>
<br>
Had any one, but a few instants before, told me that I should have ever<br>
known any man but Charles, I would have spit in his face or had I been<br>
offered infinitely a greater sum of money than that I saw paid for me,<br>
I had spurned the proposal in cold blood. But our virtues and our vices<br>
depend too much on our circumstances; unexpectedly beset as I was,<br>
betrayed by a mind weakened by a long severe affliction, and stunned<br>
with the terrors of a goal, my defeat will appear the more excusable,<br>
since I certainly was not present at, or a party in any sense to it.<br>
However, as the first enjoyment is decisive, and he was now over the<br>
bar, I thought I had no longer a right to refuse the caresses of one<br>
that had got that advantage over me, no matter how obtained; conforming<br>
myself then to this maxim, I considered myself as so much in his power,<br>
that I endured his kisses and embraces without affecting struggles or<br>
anger; not that he, as yet, gave me any pleasure, or prevailed over the<br>
aversion of my soul, to give myself up to any sensation of that sort;<br>
what I suffered, I suffered out of a kind of gratitude, and as a matter<br>
of course what had passed.<br>
<br>
He was, however, so regardful as not to attempt the renewal of those<br>
extremities which had thrown me, just before, into such violent<br>
agitations; but, now secure of possession, contented himself with<br>
bringing me to temper by degrees, and waiting at the hand of time for<br>
those fruits of generosity and courtship, which he since often<br>
reproached himself with having gathered much too green, when, yielding<br>
to the inability to resist him, and overborne by desires, he had<br>
wreaked his passion on a mere lifeless, spiritless body, dead to all<br>
purpose of joy, since taking none, it ought to be supposed incapable of<br>
giving any. This is, however, certain; my heart never thoroughly<br>
forgave him the manner in which I had fallen to him, although, in point<br>
of interest, I had fallen to him, I had reason to be pleased that he<br>
found, in my person, wherewithal to keep him from leaving me as easily<br>
as he had had me.<br>
<br>
The evening was, in the mean time, so far advanced, that the maid came<br>
in to lay the cloth for supper, when I understood, with joy, that my<br>
landlady, whose sight was present poison to me, was not to be with us.<br>
<br>
Presently a neat and elegant supper was introduced, and a bottle of<br>
Burgundy, with the other necessaries, were set on a dumb-waiter.<br>
<br>
The maid quitting the room, the gentleman insisted, with a tender<br>
warmth, that I should sit up in the elbow chair by the fire, and see<br>
him eat, if I could not be prevailed on to eat myself. I obeyed with a<br>
heart full or affliction, at the comparison it made between those<br>
delicious _t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes_ with my very dear youth, and this forced<br>
situation, this new awkward scene, imposed and obtruded on me a cruel<br>
necessity.<br>
<br>
At supper, after a great many arguments used to comfort and reconcile<br>
me to my fate, he told me that his name was H..., brother to the Earl<br>
of L.... and that having, by the suggestions of my landlady, been led<br>
to see me, he had found me perfectly to his taste, and given her a<br>
commission to procure me at any rate, and that at length he had<br>
succeeded, as much to his satisfaction as he passionately wished it<br>
might be to mine adding, withal, some flattering assurances, that I<br>
should have no cause to repent my knowledge of him.<br>
<br>
I had now got down at least half a partridge, and three or four glasses<br>
of wine, which he compelled me to drink by way of restoring nature, but<br>
whether there was any thing extraordinary put into the wine, or whether<br>
there wanted no more to revive the natural warmth of my constitution,<br>
and give fire to the old train, I began no longer to look with that<br>
constraint, not to say disguise, on Mr. H...., which I had hitherto<br>
done but, withal, there was not the least grain of love mixed with this<br>
softening of my sentiments: any other man would have been just the same<br>
to me as Mr. H..., that stood in the same circumstances, and had done<br>
for me, and with me, what he had done.<br>
<br>
There are not, on earth at least, eternal griefs; mine were, if not at<br>
an end, at least suspended: my heart, which had been so long overloaded<br>
with anguish and vexation, began to dilate and open to the last gleam<br>
of diversion or amusement. I wept a little, and my tears relieved me; I<br>
sighed, and my sighs seemed to lighten me of a load that oppressed me;<br>
my countenance grew, if not cheerful, at least more composed and free.<br>
<br>
Mr. H..., who had watched, perhaps brought on this change, knew too<br>
well not to seize it: he thrust the table imperceptibly from between<br>
us, and bringing his chair to face me, he soon began, after preparing<br>
me by all the endearments of assurance and protestations, to lay hold<br>
of my hands, to kiss me, and once more to make free with my bosom,<br>
which, being at full liberty from the disorder of a loose dishabile,<br>
now panted and throbbed, less with indignation than with fear and<br>
bashfulness, at being used so familiarly by still a stranger. But he<br>
soon gave me greater occasion to exclaim, by stooping down and slipping<br>
his hands above my garters; thence he strove to regain the pass, which<br>
he had before found so open, and unguarded; but now he could not unlock<br>
the twist of my thighs; I gently complained, and begged him to let me<br>
alone; told him I was not well. However, he saw there was more form and<br>
ceremony in my resistance, than good earnest; he made his conditions<br>
for desisting from pursuing his point, that I should be put instantly<br>
to bed, whilst he gave certain orders to the landlady, and that he<br>
would return in an hour, when he hoped to find me more reconciled to<br>
his passion for me, than I seemed at present. I neither assented nor<br>
denied, but my air and manner of receiving his proposal, gave him to<br>
see that I did not think myself enough my own mistress to refuse it.<br>
<br>
Accordingly he went out and left me, when a minute or two after, before<br>
I could recover myself into any composure for thinking, the maid came<br>
in with her mistress&rsquo;s service, and a small silver orringer of what she<br>
called a bridal posset, and desired me to eat it as I went to bed,<br>
which consequently I did, and felt immediately a heat, a fire run like<br>
a hue-and-cry through every part of my body; I burnt, I glowed, and<br>
wanted even little of wishing for any man.<br>
<br>
The maid, as soon as I was lain down, took the candle away, and wishing<br>
me a good night, went out of the room, and shut the door after her.<br>
<br>
She had hardly time to get down stairs, before Mr. H.... opened my room<br>
door softly, and came in, now undressed, in his night-gown and cap,<br>
with two lighted wax candles, and bolting the door, gave me, though I<br>
expected him, some sort of alarm. He came a tip-toe to the bed side,<br>
and saying with a gentle whisper: &ldquo;Pray, my dear, do not be startled...<br>
I will be very tender and kind to you.&rdquo; He then hurried off his<br>
clothes, and leaped into bed, having given me openings enough, whilst<br>
he was stripping, to observe his brawny structure, strong made limbs,<br>
and rough shaggy breast.<br>
<br>
The bed shook again when it received this new load. He lay on the<br>
outside, where he kept the candles burning, no doubt for the<br>
satisfaction of every sense, for as soon as he had kissed me, he rolled<br>
down the bed clothes, and seemed transported with the view of all my<br>
person at full length, which he covered with a profusion of kisses,<br>
sparing no part of me. Then, being on his knees between my thighs, he<br>
drew up his shirt, and bared all his hairy thighs, and stiff staring<br>
truncheon, red top, and rooted into a thicket of curls, which covered<br>
his belly to the novel, and gave it the air of a flesh brush; and soon<br>
I feel it joining close to mine, when he had drove the nail up to the<br>
head, and left no partition but the intermediate hair on both sides.<br>
<br>
I had it now, I felt it now, and, beginning to drive, he soon gave<br>
nature such a powerful summons down to her favourite quarters, that she<br>
could no longer refuse repairing thither; all my animals spirits then<br>
rushed mechanically to that center of attraction, and presently, inly<br>
warmed, and stirred as I was beyond bearing, I lost all restraint, and<br>
yielding to the force of the emotion, gave down, as mere woman, those<br>
effusions of pleasure, which, in the strictness of still faithful love,<br>
I could have wished to have kept in.<br>
<br>
Yet oh! what an immense difference did I feel between this impression<br>
of a pleasure merely animal, and struck out of the collision of the<br>
sexes, by a passive bodily effect, from that sweet fury, that rage of<br>
active delight which crowns the enjoyments of a mutual love passion,<br>
where two hearts, tenderly and truly united, club to exalt the joy, and<br>
give it a spirit and soul that bids defiance to that end which mere<br>
momentary desires generally terminate in, when they die of a surfeit of<br>
satisfaction!<br>
<br>
Mr. H..., whom no distinctions of that sort seemed to distract, scarce<br>
gave himself or me breathing time from the last encounter, but, as if<br>
he had tasked himself to prove that the appearances of his vigour were<br>
no signs hung out in vain, in a few minutes he was in a condition for<br>
renewing the onset; to which, preluding with a storm of kisses, he<br>
drove the same course as before, with unbated fervour; and thus, in<br>
repeated engagements, kept me constantly in exercise, till dawn of<br>
morning, in all which time he made me fully sensible of the virtues of<br>
his firm texture of limbs, his square shoulders, broad chest, compact<br>
hard muscles, in short a system of manliness, that might pass for no<br>
bad image of our ancient sturdy barons, whose race is now so thoroughly<br>
refined and frittered away into the more delicate and modern built<br>
frame of our pap-nerved softlings, who are as pale, as pretty, and<br>
almost as masculine as their sisters.<br>
<br>
Mr. H..., content, however, with having the day break upon his triumph,<br>
resigned me up to the refreshment of a rest we both wanted, and we soon<br>
dropped into a profound sleep.<br>
<br>
Though he was some time awake before me, yet he did not offer to<br>
disturb a repose he had given me so much occasion for; but on my first<br>
stirring, which was not till past ten o&rsquo;clock, I was obliged to endure<br>
one more trial of his manhood.<br>
<br>
About eleven, in came Mrs. Jones, with two basins of the richest soup,<br>
which her experience in these matters had moved her to prepare. I pass<br>
over the fulsome compliments, the cant of the decent procuress, with<br>
which she saluted us both; but though my blood rose at the sight of<br>
her, I supprest my emotions, and gave all my concerne to reflections on<br>
what would be the consequence of this new engagement.<br>
<br>
But Mr. H..., who penetrated my uneasiness, did not suffer me to<br>
languish under it, and acquainted me, that having taken a solid sincere<br>
affection to me, he would begin by giving me one leading mark of it, in<br>
removing me out of a house which must, for many reasons, be irksome and<br>
disagreeable to me, into convenient lodgings, where he would take all<br>
imaginable care of me; and desiring not to have any explanations with<br>
my landlady, or be impatient till he returned, he dressed and went out,<br>
having left me a purse with two and twenty guineas in it, being all he<br>
had about him, as he express it, to keep my pocket still further<br>
supplied.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was gone, I felt the usual consequence of the first<br>
launch into vice (for my love attachment to Charles never appeared to<br>
me in that light). I was instantly borne away down the stream without<br>
making back to the shore. My dreadful necessities, my gratitude, and<br>
above all, to say the plain truth, the dissipation and diversion I<br>
began to find in this new acquaintance, from the black corroding<br>
thoughts my heart had been a prey to, ever since the absence of my dear<br>
Charles, concurred to stun all my contrary reflections. If I now<br>
thought of my first, my only charmer, it was still with the tenderness<br>
and regret of the fondest love, embittered with the consciousness that<br>
I was no longer worthy of him. I could have begged my bread with him<br>
all over the world, but wretch that I was! I had neither the virtue or<br>
courage requisite not to outlive my separation from him.<br>
<br>
Yet, had not my heart been thus preengaged, Mr. H... might probably<br>
have been the sole master of it; but the place was full, and the force<br>
of conjectures alone had made him the possessor of my person; the<br>
charms of which had, by the bye, been his sole object and passion, and<br>
were, of course, no foundation for a love either very delicate or very<br>
durable.<br>
<br>
He did not return till six in the evening, to take me away to my new<br>
lodgings; and my moveables being soon packed, and conveyed into a<br>
hackney coach, it cost me but little regret to take my leave of a<br>
landlady whom I thought I had so much reason not to be over pleased<br>
with; and as for her part, she made no other difference to my staying<br>
or going, but what that of the profit created.<br>
<br>
We soon got to the house appointed for me, which was that of a plain<br>
tradesman, who, on the score of interest, was entirely at Mr. H...&rsquo;s<br>
devotion, and who let him the first floor, very genteelly furnished,<br>
for two guineas a week, of which I was instated mistress, with a maid<br>
to attend me.<br>
<br>
He stayed with me that evening, and we had a supper from a neighbouring<br>
tavern, after which, and a gay glass or two, the maid put me to bed.<br>
Mr. H.... soon followed, and notwithstanding the fatigues of the<br>
preceding night, I found no quarter nor remission from him: he piquet<br>
himself, as he told me, on doing the honours of my new apartment.<br>
<br>
The morning being pretty well advanced, we got to breakfast; and the<br>
ice now broke, my heart, no longer engrossed by love, began to take<br>
ease, and to please itself with such trifles Mr. H....&rsquo;s liberal liking<br>
led him to make his court to the usual vanity of our sex. Silks, laces:<br>
ear rings, pearl necklace, gold watch, in sort, all the trinkets and<br>
articles of dress were lavishly heaped upon me; the sence of which, if<br>
it did not create returns of love, forced a kind of grateful fondness,<br>
something like love: a distinction which it would be spoiling the<br>
pleasure of nine tenths of the keepers in the town to make, and is, I<br>
suppose, the very good reason why so few of them ever do make it.<br>
<br>
I was now established the kept mistress in form, well lodged, with a<br>
very sufficient allowance, and lighted up with all the lustre of dress.<br>
<br>
Mr. H.... continued kind and tender to me; yet, with all this, I was<br>
far from happy: for, besides my regrets for my dear youth, which,<br>
though often suspended or diverted, still returned upon me in certain<br>
melancholic moments with redoubled violence, I wanted more society,<br>
more dissipation.<br>
<br>
As to Mr. H.... he was so much my superior in every sense, that I felt<br>
it too much to the disadvantage of the gratitude I owed him. Thus he<br>
gained my esteem, though he could not raise my taste; I was qualified<br>
for no sort of conversation with him, except one sort, and that is a<br>
satisfaction which leaves tiresome intervals, if not filled up by love,<br>
or other amusements.<br>
<br>
Mr. H...., so experienced, so learned in the ways of women, numbers of<br>
whom had passed through his hands, doubtless, soon perceived this<br>
uneasiness, and, without approving, or liking me the better for it, had<br>
the complaisance to indulge me.<br>
<br>
He made suppers at my lodging, where he brought several companions of<br>
his pleasures, with their mistresses; and by this means I got into a<br>
circle of acquaintance, that soon stripped me of all the remains of<br>
bashfulness and modesty which might be yet left of my country<br>
education, and were, to a just taste, perhaps, the greatest of my<br>
charms.<br>
<br>
We visited one another in form, and mimicked, as near as we could, all<br>
the miseries, the follies, and impertinencies of the women in quality,<br>
in the round of which they trifle away their time, without it ever<br>
entering their little heads, that on earth there cannot subsist any<br>
thing more silly, more flat, more insipid and worthless, than,<br>
generally considered, their system of life is: they ought to treat the<br>
men as their tyrants, indeed! were they to condemn them to it.<br>
<br>
But though, amongst the kept mistresses (and I was now acquainted with<br>
a good many, besides some useful matrons, who live by their connexions<br>
with them), I hardly knew one that did not perfectly detest their<br>
keepers, and, of course, made little or no scruple of any infidelity<br>
they could safely accomplish, I had still no notion of wronging mine:<br>
for, besides that no mark of jealousy on his side started me the hint,<br>
or gave me the provocation to play him a trick of that sort, and that<br>
his constant generosity, politeness, and tender attention to please me,<br>
forced a regard to him, that, without affecting my heart, insured him<br>
my fidelity, no object had yet presented that could overcome the<br>
habitual liking I had contracted for him and I was on the eve of<br>
obtaining, from the movements of his own voluntary generosity, a modest<br>
provision for life, when an accident happened which broke all the<br>
measures he had resolved upon in my favour.<br>
<br>
I had now lived near seven months with Mr. H.... when one day returning<br>
to my lodgings, from a visit in the neighbourhood, where I used to stay<br>
longer, I found the street door open, and the maid of the house<br>
standing at it, talking with some of her acquaintance, so that I came<br>
in without knocking and, as I passed by, she told me Mr. H.... was<br>
above. I slept up stairs into my own bed-chamber, with no other thought<br>
than of pulling off my hat etc., and then to wait upon him in the<br>
dining room, into which my bed-chamber had a door, as is common enough.<br>
Whilst I was untying my hat strings, I fancied I heard my maid Hannah&rsquo;s<br>
voice and a sort of tustle, which raised my curiosity; I stole softly<br>
to the door, where a knot in the wood had been slipped out, and<br>
afforded a very commanding peep-hole to the scene then in agitation,<br>
the actors of which had been to earnestly employed to hear my opening<br>
my own door, from the landing place of the stairs, into my bedchamber.<br>
<br>
The first sight that struck me was Mr. H.... pulling and hauling this<br>
coarse country strammel towards a couch that stood in a corner of the<br>
dining-room; to which the girl made only a sort of awkward holdening<br>
resistance, crying out so loud, that I, who listened at the door, could<br>
scarce hear her: &ldquo;Pray Sir, don&rsquo;t.., let me alone... I am not for your<br>
turn... You cannot, sure, demean yourself with such a poor body as I...<br>
Lord! Sir, my mistress may come home... I must not indeed... I will cry<br>
out...&rdquo; All of which did not hinder her from insensibly suffering<br>
herself to be brought to the foot of the couch, upon which a push of no<br>
mighty violence served to give her a very easy fall, and my gentleman<br>
having got up his hands to the strong hold of her Virtue, she, no<br>
doubt, thought it was time to give up the argument, and that all<br>
further defense would be vain: and he, throwing her petticoats over her<br>
face, which was now as red as scarlet, discovered a pair of stout,<br>
plump, substantial thighs, and tolerably white; he mounted them round<br>
his haps, and coming out with his drawn weapon, stuck it in the cloven<br>
sport, where he seemed to find a less difficult entrance than perhaps<br>
he had flattered himself with (for, by the way, this blouse had left<br>
her place in the country, for a bastard), and, indeed, all his motions<br>
shewed he was lodged pretty much at large. After he had done, his Deare<br>
gets up, drops her petticoats down, and smooths her apron and<br>
handkerchief. Mr. H.... looked a little silly, and taking out some<br>
money, gave it her, with an air indifferent enough, bidding her be a<br>
good girl, and say nothing.<br>
<br>
Had I loved this man, it was not in nature for me to have had patience<br>
to see the whole scene through: I should have broke in and played the<br>
jealous princess with a vengeance. But that was not the case: my pride<br>
alone was hurt, my heart not, and I could easier win upon myself to see<br>
how far he would go, till I had no uncertainty upon my conscience.<br>
<br>
The least delicate of all affairs of this sort being now over, I<br>
retired softly into my closet, where I began to consider what I should<br>
do. My first scheme naturally, was to rush in and upbraid them; this,<br>
indeed, flattered my present emotions and vexations, as it would have<br>
given immediate vent to them; but, on second thoughts, not being so<br>
clear as to the consequence to be apprehended from such a step, I began<br>
my discovery still a safer season, when dissembly my discovery till a<br>
safer season, when Mr. H.... should have perfected the settlement he<br>
had made overtures to me of, and which I was not to think such a<br>
violent explanation, as I was indeed not equal to the management of,<br>
could possibly forward, and might destroy. On the other hand, the<br>
provocation seemed too gross, too flagrant not to give me some thoughts<br>
of revenge; the very start of which idea restored me to perfect<br>
composure; and delighted as I was with the confused plan of it in my<br>
head, I was easily mistress enough of myself to support the part of<br>
ignorance I had prescribed to myself; and as all this circle of<br>
reflections was instantly over, I stole a tip-toe to the passage door,<br>
and opening it with a noise, passed for having that moment come home;<br>
and after a short pause, as if to pull off my things, I opened the door<br>
into the dining room, where I fund the dowdy blowing the fire, and my<br>
faithful shepherd walking about the room, and wistling, as cool and<br>
unconcerned as if nothing had happened. I think, however, he had not<br>
much to brag of having out-dissembled me: for I kept up, nobly, the<br>
character of our sex for art, and went up to him with the same open air<br>
of frankness as I had ever received him. He stayed but a little while,<br>
made some excuse for not being able to stay the evening with me, and<br>
went out.<br>
<br>
As for the wench, she was now spoiled, at least for my servant; and<br>
scarce eight and forty hours were gone round, before her insolence, on<br>
what had passed betwen Mr. H.... and her, gave me so fair an occasion<br>
to turn her away, at a minute&rsquo;s warning, that, not to have done it<br>
would have been the wonder; so that he could neither disapprove it nor<br>
find in it the least reason to suspect my original motive. What became<br>
of her afterwards, I know not; but generous as Mr. H.... was, he<br>
undoubtedly made her amends: though, I dare answer, that he kept up no<br>
further commerce with her of that sort; as his stooping to such a<br>
coarse morsel, was only a sudden sally of lust, on seeing a wholesome<br>
looking, buxom country wench, and no more strange than hunger, or even<br>
a whimsical appetite&rsquo;s making a fling meal of neck-beef, for change of<br>
diet.<br>
<br>
Had I considered this escapade of Mr. H.... in no more than that light<br>
and contented myself with turning away the wench, I had thought and<br>
acted right; but, flushed as I was with imaginary wrongs, I should have<br>
held Mr. H... to have been cheaply off, if I had not pushed my revenge<br>
farther, and repaid him, as exactly as could for the soul of me, in the<br>
same coin.<br>
<br>
Nor was this worthy act of justice long delayed: I had it too much at<br>
heart. Mr. H... had, about a fortnight before, taken into his service a<br>
tenant&rsquo;s son, just come out the country, a very handsome young lad,<br>
scarce turned of nineteen, fresh as a rose, well sharped and clear<br>
limbed: in short, a very good excuse for any woman&rsquo;s liking, even<br>
though revenge had been out of the question; any woman, I say, who was<br>
disprejudiced, and that wit and spirit enough to prefer a point of<br>
pleasure to a point of pride.<br>
<br>
Mr. H... had clapped a livery upon him; and his chief employ was, after<br>
being shewn my lodgings, to bring and carry letters or messages between<br>
his master and me; and as the situation of all kept ladies is not the<br>
fittest to inspire respect, even to the meanest of mankind, and,<br>
perhaps, less of it from the most ignorant, I could not help observing<br>
that this lad, who was, I suppose, acquainted with my relation to his<br>
master by his fellow servants, used to eye me in that bashful confused<br>
way, more expressive, more moving and readier caught at by our sex,<br>
than any other declarations whatever: my figure had, it seems, struck<br>
him, and modest and innocent as he was, he did not himself know that<br>
the pleasure he took in looking at me was love, or desire; but his<br>
eyes, naturally wanton, and now inflamed with passion, spoke a great<br>
deal more than he durst have imagined they did. Hitherto, indeed, I had<br>
only taken notice of the comeliness of the youth, but without the least<br>
design: my pride alone would have guarded me from a thought that way,<br>
had not Mr. H....&rsquo;s condescension with my maid, where there was not<br>
half the temptation, in point of person, set me a dangerous example;<br>
but now I began to look on this stripling as every way a delicious<br>
instrument of my designed retaliation upon Mr. H.... of an obligation<br>
for which I should have made a conscience to die in his debt.<br>
<br>
In order then to pave the way for the accomplishment of my scheme, for<br>
two or three times that the young fellow came to me with messages, I<br>
managed so, or without affectation to have him admitted to my bed side,<br>
or brought to me at my toilet, where I was dressing; and by carelessly<br>
shewing or letting him, as if without meaning or design, sometimes my<br>
bosom rather more bare than it should be; sometimes my hair, of which I<br>
had a very fine head, in the natural flow of it while combing;<br>
sometimes a neat leg, that had unfortunately slipt its garter, which I<br>
made no scruple of tying before him, easily gave him the impressions<br>
favourable to my purpose, which I could perceive to sparkle in his<br>
eyes, and glow in his cheeks: then certain slight squeezes by the hand,<br>
as I took letters from him, did his business completely.<br>
<br>
When I saw him thus moved, and fired for my purpose, I inflamed him yet<br>
more, by asking him several leading questions, such as: &ldquo;Had he a<br>
mistress?... was she prettier than me?... could he love such a one as I<br>
was?...&rdquo; and the like; to all which the blushing simpleton answered to<br>
my wish, in a strain of perfect nature, perfect undebauched innocence,<br>
but with all the awkwardness and simplicity of country breeding.<br>
<br>
When I thought I had sufficiently ripened him for the laudable point I<br>
had in view, one day that I expected him at a particular hour, I took<br>
care to have the coast clear for the reception I designed him; and, as<br>
I laid it, he came to the dining room door, tapped at it, and, in my<br>
bidding him come in; he did so, and shut the door after him. I desired<br>
him, then, to bolt it on the inside, pretending it would not otherwise<br>
keep shut.<br>
<br>
I was then lying at length upon that very couch, the scene of Mr.<br>
H....&rsquo;s polite joys, in an undress, which was with all the art of<br>
negligence flowing loose, and in a most tempting disorder: no stays, no<br>
hoop..., no incumbrance whatever. On the other hand, he stood at a<br>
little distance, that gave me a full view of a fine featured, shapely,<br>
healthy country lad, breathing the sweets of fresh blooming youth; his<br>
hair, which was of a perfect shining black, played to his face in<br>
natural side curls, and was set out with a smart tuck-up behind; new<br>
buckskin breechs, that, clipping close, shewed the shape of a plump,<br>
well made thigh; white stockings, garter-laced livery, shoulder knot,<br>
altogether composed a figure of pure flesh and blood, and appeared<br>
under no disgrace from the lowness of a dress, to which a certain<br>
spruce neatness seems peculiarly fitted.<br>
<br>
I bid him come towards me, and give me his letter, at the same time<br>
throwing down, carelessly, a book I had in my hands. He coloured, and<br>
came within reach of delivering me the letter, which he held out,<br>
awkwardly enough, for me to take, with his eyes rivetted on my bosom,<br>
which was, through the designed disorder of my handkerchief,<br>
sufficiently bare, and rather than hid.<br>
<br>
I, smiling in his face, took the letter, and immediately catching hold<br>
of his shirt sleeve, drew him towards me, blushing, and almost<br>
trembling; for surely his extreme bashfulness, and utter inexperience<br>
called for, at least, all the advances to encourage him: his body was<br>
now conveniently inclined toward me, and just softly chucking his<br>
beardless chin, I asked him: &ldquo;If he was afraid of a lady?...&rdquo; and with<br>
that took, and carrying his hands to my breasts, I press it tenderly to<br>
them. They were now finely furnished, and raised in flesh, so that,<br>
panting with desire, they rose and fell, in quick heaves, under his<br>
touch: at this, the boy&rsquo;s eyes began to lighten with all the fires of<br>
inflamed nature, and his cheeks flushed with a deep scarlet:<br>
tongue-tied with joy, rapture, and bashfulness, he could not speak, but<br>
then his looks, his emotion, sufficiently satisfied me that my train<br>
had taken, and that I had no disappointment to fear.<br>
<br>
My lips, which I threw in his way, so that he could not escape kissing<br>
them, fixed, fired, and emboldened him: and now, glancing my eyes<br>
towards that part of his dress which covered the essential object of<br>
enjoyment, I plainly discovered the swell and commotion there; and as I<br>
was now too far advanced to stop in so fair a way, and was indeed no<br>
longer able to contain myself, or wait the slower progress of his<br>
maiden bash-fulness (for such it seemed, and really was), I stole my<br>
hands upon his thighs, down one of which I could both see and feel a<br>
stiff hard body, confined by his breeches, that my fingers could<br>
discover no end to. Curious then, and eager to unfold so alarming a<br>
mystery, playing, as it were, with his buttons, which were bursting<br>
ripe from the active force within, those of his waistband and fore-flap<br>
flew open at a touch, when out IT started; and now, disengaged from the<br>
shirt, I saw, with wonder and surprise, what? not the play thing of a<br>
boy, not the weapon of a man, but a Maypole, of so enormous a standard,<br>
that had proportions been observed, it must have belonged to a young<br>
giant. Yet I could not, without pleasure, behold, and even venture to<br>
feel, such a length, such a breadth of animated ivory! perfectly well<br>
turned and fashioned, the proud stiffness of which distented its skin,<br>
whose smooth polish and velvet softness might vie with that of the most<br>
delicate of our sex, and whose exquisite whiteness was not a little set<br>
off by a sprout of black curling hair round the root: through the jetty<br>
springs of which the fair skin shewed as in a fine evening you may have<br>
remarked the clear light through the branchwork of distant trees<br>
over-topping the summit of a hill: then the broad of blueish-casted<br>
incarnate of the head, and blue serpentines of its veins, altogether<br>
composed the most striking assemblage of figure and colours in nature.<br>
In short, it stood an object of terror and delight.<br>
<br>
But what was yet more surprising, the owner of this natural curiosity,<br>
through the want of occasions in the strictness of his home breeding,<br>
and the little time he had been in town not having afforded him one;<br>
was hitherto an absolute stranger, in practice at least, to the use of<br>
all that manhood he was so nobly stocked with; and it now fell to my<br>
lot to stand his first trial of it, if I could resolve to run the risks<br>
of its disproportion to that tender part of me, which such an oversized<br>
machine was very fit to lay in ruins.<br>
<br>
But it was now of the latest to deliberate, for, by this time, the<br>
young fellow, over heated with the present objects, and too high metled<br>
to be longer curbed in by that modesty and awe which had hitherto<br>
restrained him, ventured, under the stronger impulse, and instructive<br>
promptership of nature alone, to slip his hands, trembling with eager<br>
impetuous desires, under my petticoats; and seeing, I suppose, nothing<br>
extremely severe in my looks, to stop or dash him, he feels out, and<br>
seizes, gently, the center spot of his ardours. Oh then! the fiery<br>
touch of his lingers determines me, and my fears melting away before<br>
the glowing intolerable heat, my thighs disclose of themselves, and<br>
yield all liberty to his hand: and now, a favourable movement giving my<br>
petticoats a toss, the avenue lay too fair, too open to be missed. He<br>
is now upon me: I had placed myself with a jerk under him, as<br>
commodious and open as possible to his attempts, which were untoward<br>
enough, for his machine, meeting with no inlet, bore and battered<br>
stiffly against me in random pushes, now above, now below, now beside<br>
his point; till, burning with impatience from its irritating touches, I<br>
guided gently, with my hand, this furious fescue to where my young<br>
novice was now to be taught his first lesson of pleasure. Thus he<br>
nicked, at length, the warm and insufficient orifice; but he was made<br>
to find no breach impracticable, and mine, though so often entered, was<br>
still far from wide enough to take him easily in.<br>
<br>
By my direction, however, the head of his unwieldy machine was so<br>
critically pointed, that, feeling him fore-right against the tender<br>
opening, a favourable motion from me met his timely thrust, by which<br>
the lips of it, strenuously dilated, gave way to his thus assisted<br>
impetuosity, so that we might both feel that he had gained a lodgment.<br>
Pursuing then his point, he soon, by violent, and, to me, most painful<br>
piercing thrusts, wedges himself at length so far in, as to be now<br>
tolerably secure of his entrance: here he stuck, and I now felt such a<br>
mixture of pleasure and pain, as there is no giving a definition of. I<br>
dreaded alike his splitting me farther up, or his withdrawing; I could<br>
not bear either to keep or part with him. The sense of pain, however,<br>
prevailing, from his prodigious size and stiffness, acting upon me in<br>
those continued rapid thrusts, with which he furiously pursued his<br>
penetration, made me cry out gently: &ldquo;Oh, my dear, you hurt me!&rdquo; This<br>
was enough to check the tender respectful boy even in his mid-career;<br>
and he immediately drew out the sweet cause of my complaint, whilst his<br>
eyes eloquently expressed, at once, his grief for hurting me, and his<br>
reluctance at dislodging from quarters, of which the warmth and<br>
closeness had given him a gust of pleasure, that he was now desire mad<br>
to satisfy, and yet too much a novice not to be afraid of my<br>
withholding his relief, on account of the pain he had put me to.<br>
<br>
But I was, myself, far from being pleased with his having too much<br>
regarded my tender exclaims; for now, more fired with the object before<br>
me, as it still stood with the fiercest erection, unbonneted, and<br>
displayed its broad vermilion head, I first gave the youth a<br>
re-encouraging kiss, which he repaid me with a fervour that seemed at<br>
once to thank me, and bribe my further compliance; and soon replaced<br>
myself in a posture to receive, at all risk, the renewed invasion,<br>
which he did not delay an instant: for, being presently remounted, I<br>
once more felt the smooth hard gristle forcing an entrance, which he<br>
achieved rather easier than before. Pained, however, as I was, with his<br>
efforts of gaining a complete admission, which he was so regardful as<br>
to manage by gentle degrees, I took care not to complain. In the mean<br>
time, the soft strait passage gradually loosens, yields, and, stretched<br>
to its utmost bearing, by the stick, thick, indriven engine, sensible,<br>
at once, to the ravishing pleasure of the feel and the pain of the<br>
distension, let him in about half way, when all the most nervous<br>
activity he now exerted, to further his penetration, gained him not an<br>
inch of his purpose: for, whilst he hesitated there, the crisis of<br>
pleasure overtook him, and the close compressure of the warm<br>
surrounding flow drew from him the ecstatic gush, even before mine was<br>
ready to meet it, kept up by the pain I had endured in the course of<br>
the engagement, from the insufferable size of his weapon, though it was<br>
not as yet in above half its length.<br>
<br>
I expected then, but without wishing it, that he would draw, but was<br>
pleasingly disappointed: for he was not to be let off so. The well<br>
breathed youth, hot-mettled, and flush with genial juices, was now<br>
fairly in for making me know my driver. As soon, then, as he had made a<br>
short pause, waking, as it were, out of the trance of pleasure (in<br>
which every sense seemed lost for a while, whilst, with his eyes shut,<br>
and short quick breathings, he had yielded down his maiden tribute), he<br>
still kept his post, yet unsated with enjoyment, and solacing in these<br>
so new delights; till his stiffness, which had scarce perceptibly<br>
remitted, being thoroughly recovered to him, who had not once<br>
unsheathed, he proceeded afresh to cleave and open to himself an entire<br>
entry into me, which was not a little made easy to him by the balsamic<br>
injection, with: which he had just plentifully moistened the whole<br>
internals of the passage. Redoubling, then, the active energy of his<br>
thrusts, favoured by the fervid appetency of my motions, the soft oiled<br>
wards can no longer stand so effectual a picklock, but yield, and open<br>
him an entrance. And now, with conspiring nature, and my industry,<br>
strong to aid him, he pierces, penetrates, and at length, winning his<br>
way inch by inch, gets entirely in, and finally, a home made thrust<br>
sheaths it up to the guard; on the information of which, from the close<br>
jointure of our bodies (insomuch that the hair on both sides perfectly<br>
interweaved and incircled together), the eyes of the transported youth<br>
sparkled with more joyous fires, and all his looks and motions<br>
acknowledged excess of pleasure, which I now began to share, for I felt<br>
him in my very vitals! I was quite sick with delight! stirred beyond<br>
bearing with its furious agitations within me, and gorged and crammed,<br>
even to a surfeit. Thus I lay gasping, panting under him, till his<br>
broken breathings, faultering accents, eyes twinkling with humid fires,<br>
lunges more furious, and an increased stiffness, gave me to hail the<br>
approaches of the second period: it came... and the sweet youth,<br>
overpowered with the ecstasy, died away in my arms, melting a flood<br>
that shot in genial warmth into the innermost recesses of my body;<br>
every conduit of which, dedicated to that pleasure, was on flow to mix<br>
with it. Thus we continued for some instants, lost, breathless,<br>
senseless of every thing, and in every part but those favourite ones of<br>
nature, in which all that we enjoyed of life and sensation was now<br>
totally concentered.<br>
<br>
When our mutual trance was a little over, and the young fellow had<br>
withdrawn that delicious stretcher, with which he had most plentifully<br>
drowned all thoughts of revenge, in the sense of actual pleasure, the<br>
widened wounded passage refunded a stream of pearly liquids, which<br>
flowed down my thighs, mixed with streaks of blood, the marks of the<br>
ravage of that monstrous machine of his, which had now triumphed over a<br>
kind of second maidenhead. I stole, however, my handkerchief to those<br>
parts, and wiped them as dry as I could, whilst he was re-adjusting and<br>
buttoning up.<br>
<br>
I made him sit down by me, and as he had gathered courage from such<br>
extreme intimacy, he gave me an aftercourse of pleasure, in a natural<br>
burst of tender gratitude and joy, at the new scenes of bliss I had<br>
opened to him: scenes positively new, as he had never before had the<br>
least acquaintance with that mysterious mark, the cloven stamp of<br>
female distinction, though nobody better qualified than he to penetrate<br>
into its deepest recesses, or do it nobler justice. But when, by<br>
certain motions, certain unquietness of his hands, that wandered not<br>
without design, I found he languished for satisfying a curiosity,<br>
natural enough, to view and handle those parts which attract and<br>
concenter the warmest force of imagination, charmed, as I was, to have<br>
any occasion of obliging and humouring his young desires, I suffered<br>
him to proceed as he pleased, without check or control, to the<br>
satisfaction of them.<br>
<br>
Easily, then, reading in my eyes the full permission of myself to all<br>
his wishes, he scarce pleased himself more than me; when, having<br>
insinuated his hand under my petticoat and shift, he presently removed<br>
those bars to the sight, by slily lifting them upwards, under favour of<br>
a thousand kisses, which he thought, perhaps, necessary to divert my<br>
attention from what he was about. All my drapery being now rolled up to<br>
my waist, I threw myself into such a posture upon the couch, as gave up<br>
to him, in full view, the whole region of delight, and all the<br>
luxurious landscape around it. The transported youth devoured every<br>
thing with his eyes, and tried, with his fingers, to lay more open to<br>
his sight the secrets of that dark and delicious deep: he opens the<br>
folding lips, the softness of which, yielding entry to any thing of a<br>
hard body, close round it, and oppose the sight; and feeling further,<br>
meets with, and wonder at, a soft fleshy excrescence, which, limber and<br>
relaxed after the late enjoyment, now grew, under the touch and<br>
examination of his fiery fingers, more and more stiff and considerable,<br>
till the titillating ardours of that so sensible part made me sigh, as<br>
if he had hurt me; on which he withdrew his curious probing fingers,<br>
asking me pardon, as it were, in a kiss that rather increased the flame<br>
there.<br>
<br>
Novelty ever makes the strongest impressions, and in pleasures,<br>
especially; no wonder then, that he was swallowed up in raptures of<br>
admiration of things so interesting by their nature, and now seen and<br>
handled for the first time. On my part, I was richly overpaid for the<br>
pleasure I gave him, in that of examining the power of those objects<br>
thus abandoned to him, naked and free to his loosest wish, over the<br>
artless, natural stripling: his eyes streaming fire, his cheeks glowing<br>
with a florid red, his fervid frequent sighs, whilst his hands<br>
convulsively squeezed, opened, pressed together again the lips and<br>
sides of that deep flesh wound, or gently twitched the over-growing<br>
moss; and all proclaimed the excess, the riot of joys, in having his<br>
wantonness thus humoured. But he did not long abuse my patience, for<br>
the objects before him had now put him by all his, and, coming out with<br>
that formidable machine of his, he lets the fury loose, and pointing it<br>
directly to the pouting-lip mouth, that bid him sweet defiance in dumb<br>
shew, squeezes in his head, and, driving with refreshed rage, breaks<br>
in, and plugs up the whole passage of that soft pleasure-conduit pipe,<br>
where he makes all shake again, and put, once more, all within me into<br>
such an uproar, as nothing could still, but a fresh inundation from the<br>
very engine of those flames, as well as from all the springs with which<br>
nature floats that reservoir of joy, when risen to its floodmark.<br>
<br>
I was now so bruised, so battered, so spent with this overmatch, that I<br>
could hardly stir, or raise myself, but lay palpitating, till the<br>
ferment of my senses subsiding by degrees, and the hour striking at<br>
which I was obliged to dispatch my young man, I tenderly advised him of<br>
the necessity there was for parting; at which I felt so much<br>
displeasure as he could do, who seemed eagerly disposed to keep the<br>
field, and to enter on a fresh action. But the danger was too great,<br>
and after some hearty kisses of leave, and recommendations of secrecy<br>
and discretion, I forced myself to send him away, not without<br>
assurances of seeing him again, to the same purpose, as soon as<br>
possible, and thrust a guinea into his hands: not more, less, being too<br>
flush of money, a suspicion or discovery might arise from thence;<br>
having everything to fear from the dangerous indiscretion of that age<br>
in which young fellows would be too irresistible, too charming, if we<br>
had not that terrible fault to guard against.<br>
<br>
Giddy and intoxicated as I was with such satiating draughts of<br>
pleasure, I still lay on the couch, supinely stretched out, in a<br>
delicious languor diffused over all my limbs, hugging myself for being<br>
thus revenged to my heart&rsquo;s content, and that in a manner so precisely<br>
alike, and on the identical spot in which I had received the supposed<br>
injury. No reflections on the consequences ever once perplexed me, nor<br>
did I make myself one single reproach for having, by this step,<br>
completely entered myself into a profession more decried than disused.<br>
I should have held it ingratitude to the pleasure I had received, to<br>
have repented of it; and since I was now over the bar, I thought, by<br>
plunging head and ears into the stream I was hurried away by, to drown<br>
all sense of shame or reflection.<br>
<br>
Whilst I was thus making these laudable dispositions, and whispering to<br>
myself a kind of tacit vow of incontinency, enters Mr. H... The<br>
consciousness of what I had been doing deepened yet the glowing of my<br>
cheeks, flushed with the warmth of the late action, which, joined to<br>
the piquant air of my dishabile, drew from Mr. H.... a compliment on my<br>
looks, which he was proceeding to bask the sincerity of with proofs,<br>
and that with so brisk an action, as made me tremble for fear of a<br>
discovery from the condition those parts were left in from their late<br>
severe handling: the orifice dilated and inflamed, the lips swollen<br>
with their uncommon distension, the ringlets pressed down, crushed and<br>
uncurled with the over flowing moisture that had wet everything round<br>
it; in short, the different feel and state of things would hardly have<br>
passed upon one of Mr. H.....&rsquo;s nicety and experience unaccounted for<br>
but by the real cause. But here the woman saved me: I pretended a<br>
violent disorder of my head, and a feverish heat, that indisposed me<br>
too much to receive his embraces. He gave in to this, and good<br>
naturedly desisted. Soon after, an old lady coming in made a third,<br>
very apropos for the confusion I was in, and Mr. H...., after bidding<br>
me take care of myself, and recommending me to my repose, left me much<br>
at ease and relieved by his absence.<br>
<br>
In the close of the evening, I took care to have prepared for me a warm<br>
bath of aromatik and sweet herbs; in which having fully laved and<br>
solaced myself, I came out voluptuously refreshed in body and spirit.<br>
<br>
The next morning waking pretty early, after a night&rsquo;s perfect rest and<br>
composure, it was not without some dread and uneasiness that I thought<br>
of what innovation that tender soft system of mine might have<br>
sustained, from the shock of a machine so sized for its destruction.<br>
<br>
Struck with this apprehension, I scarce dared to carry my hand thither,<br>
to inform myself of the state and posture of things.<br>
<br>
But I was soon agreeably cured of my fears.<br>
<br>
The silky hair that covered round the borders, now smoothed and<br>
re-pruned, had resumed its wonted curl and trimness; the fleshy pouting<br>
lips that had stood the brunt of the engagement, were no longer swollen<br>
or moisture-drenched; and neither they, nor the passage into which they<br>
opened, that had suffered so great a dilation, betrayed any the least<br>
alteration, outwardly or inwardly, to the most curious research,<br>
notwithstanding the laxity that naturally follows the warm bath.<br>
<br>
This continuation of that grateful stricture which is in us, to the<br>
men, the very jet of their pleasure, I owed, it seems, to a happy habit<br>
of body, juicy, plump and furnished, towards the texture of those<br>
parts, with a fullness of soft springy flesh, that yielding<br>
sufficiently, as it does, to almost any distension soon recovers itself<br>
so as to re-tighten that strict compression of its mantlings and folds,<br>
which form the sides of the passage, wherewith it so tenderly embraces<br>
and closely clips any foreign body introduced into it, such as my<br>
exploring finger then was.<br>
<br>
Finding then every thing in due tone and order, I remember my fears,<br>
only to make a jest of them to myself. And now, palpably mistress of<br>
any size of man, and triumphing in my double achievement of pleasure<br>
and revenge, I abandoned myself entirely to the ideas of all the<br>
delight I had swam in. I lay stretching out, glowingly alive all over,<br>
and tossing with burning impatience for the renewal of joys that had<br>
sinned but in a sweet excess; nor did I lose my longing, for about ten<br>
in the morning, according to expectation, Will, my new humble<br>
sweetheart, came with a message from his master, Mr. H...., to know how<br>
I did. I had taken care to send my maid on an errand into the city,<br>
that I was sure would take up time enough; and, from the people of the<br>
house, I had nothing to fear, as they were plain good sort of folks,<br>
and wise enough to mind no more other people&rsquo;s business than they could<br>
well help.<br>
<br>
All dispositions then made, not forgetting that of lying in bed to<br>
receive him, when he was entered the door of my bed chamber, a latch,<br>
that I governed by a wire, descended and secured it.<br>
<br>
I could not but observe that my young minion was as much spruced out as<br>
could be expected from one in his condition: a desire of pleasing that<br>
could not be indifferent to me, since it proved that I pleased him;<br>
which, I assure you, was now a point I was not above having in view.<br>
<br>
His hair trimly dressed, clean linen, and, above all, a hale, ruddy,<br>
wholesome country look, made him out as pretty a piece of woman&rsquo;s meat<br>
as you could see, and I should have thought any one much out of taste,<br>
that could not have made a hearty meal of such a morsel as nature<br>
seemed to have designed for the highest diet of pleasure.<br>
<br>
And why should I here suppress the delight I received from this amiable<br>
creature, in remarking each artless look, each motion of pure<br>
indissembled nature, betrayed by his wanton eyes; or shewing,<br>
transparently, the glow and suffusion of blood through his fresh, clear<br>
skin, whilst even his stury rustic pressure wanted not their peculiar<br>
charm? Oh! but, say you, this was a young fellow of too low a rank of<br>
life to deserve so great a display. May be so: but was my condition,<br>
strictly considered, one jot more exalted? or, had I really been much<br>
above him, did not his capacity of giving such exquisite pleasure<br>
sufficiently raise and enoble him, to me, at least? Let who would, for<br>
me cherish, respect, and reward the painter&rsquo;s, the statuary&rsquo;s, the<br>
musician&rsquo;s art, in proportion to the delight taken in them: but at my<br>
age, and with my taste for pleasure, a taste strongly constitutional to<br>
me, the talent of pleasing, with which nature has endowed a handsome<br>
person, formed to me the greatest of all merits; compared to which, the<br>
vulgar prejudices in favour of titles, dignities, honours, and the<br>
like, held a very low rank indeed. Nor perhaps would the beauties of<br>
the body be so much affected to be held cheap, were they, in their<br>
nature, to be bought and delivered. But for me, whose natural<br>
philosophy all resided in the favourite center of sense, and who was<br>
ruled by its powerful instinct in taking pleasure by its right handle,<br>
I could scarce have made a choice more to my purpose.<br>
<br>
Mr. H....&rsquo;s loftier qualifications of birth, fortune and sense, laid me<br>
under a sort of subjection and constraint, that were far from making<br>
harmony in the concert of love; nor had he, perhaps, thought me worth<br>
softening that superiority to; but, with this lad, I was more on the<br>
level which love delights in.<br>
<br>
We may say what we please, but those we can be the easiest and freest<br>
with, are ever those we like, not to say love the best.<br>
<br>
With this stripling, all whose art of love was the action of it, I<br>
could, without check of awe or restraint, give a loose to jay, and<br>
execute every scheme of dalliance my fond fancy might put me on, in<br>
which he was, in every sense, a most exquisite companion. And now my<br>
great pleasure lay in humouring all the petulances, all the wanton<br>
frolic of a raw novice just fledged, and keen on the burning scent of<br>
his game, but unbroken to the sport: and, to carry on the figure, who<br>
could better read the wood than he, or stand fairer for the heart of<br>
the hunt?<br>
<br>
He advanced then to my bed side, and whilst he faultered out his<br>
message, I could observe his colour rise, and his eyes lighten with<br>
joy, in seeing me in a situation as favourable to his loosest wishes,<br>
as if he had bespoke the play.<br>
<br>
I smiled, and put out my hand towards him, which he kneeled down to (a<br>
politeness taught him by love alone, that great master of it) and<br>
greedily kissed. After exchanging a few confused questions and answers,<br>
I asked him if he would come to bed to me, for the little time I could<br>
venture to detain him. This was just asking a person, dying with<br>
hunger, to feast upon the dish on earth the most to his palate.<br>
Accordingly, without further reflection, his clothes were off in an<br>
instant; when, blushing still more at this new liberty, he got under<br>
the bed clothes I held up to receive him, and was now in bed with a<br>
woman for the first time in his life.<br>
<br>
Here began the usual tender preliminaries, as delicious, perhaps, as<br>
the crowning act of enjoyment itself; which they often beget an<br>
impatience of, that makes pleasure destructive of itself, by hurrying<br>
on the final period, and closing that scene of bliss, in which the<br>
actors are generally too well pleased with their parts, not to wish<br>
them an eternity of duration.<br>
<br>
When we had sufficiently graduated our advances towards the main point,<br>
by toying, kissing, clipping, feeling my breasts, now round and plump,<br>
feeling that part of me I might call a furnace mouth, from the<br>
prodigious intense heat his fiery touches had rekindled there, my young<br>
sportsman, emboldened by the very freedom he could wish, wontonly takes<br>
my hand, and carries it to that enormous machine of his, that stood<br>
with a stiffness! a hardness! an upward bend of erection! and which,<br>
together with it bottom dependence, the inestimable bulse of ladies<br>
jewels, formed a grand showout of goods indeed! Then its dimensions,<br>
mocking either grasp or span, almost renewed my terrors.<br>
<br>
I could not conceive how, or by what means I could take, or put such a<br>
bulk out of sight. I stroked it gently, on which the mutinous rogue<br>
seemed to swell, and gather a new degree of fierceness and insolence;<br>
so that finding it grew not to be trifled with any longer, I prepared<br>
for rubbers in good earnest.<br>
<br>
Slipping then a pillow under me, that I might give him the fairest<br>
play, I guided officiously with my hand this furious battering ram,<br>
whose ruby head, presenting nearest the resemblance of a heart, I<br>
applied to its proper mark, which lay as finely elevated as we could<br>
wish; my hips being borne up, and my thighs at their utmost extension,<br>
the gleamy warmth that shot from it, made him feel that he was at the<br>
mouth of the indraught, and driving fore right, the powerfully divided<br>
lips of that pleasure-thirsty channel received him. He hesitated a<br>
little; then, settled well in the passage, he makes his way up the<br>
straights of it, with a difficulty nothing more than pleasing, widening<br>
as he went so as to distend and smooth each soft furrow: our pleasure<br>
increasing deliciously, in proportion to our points of mutual touch<br>
increased in that so vital part of me which I had now taken him, all<br>
indriven, and completely sheathed; and which, crammed as it was,<br>
stretched splitting ripe, gave it so gratefully straight an<br>
accommodation! so strict a fold! a suction so fierce! that gave and<br>
took unutterable delight. We had now reached the closest point of<br>
union; but when he beckened to come on the fiercer, as if I had ben<br>
actuated by a fear of losing him, in the height of my fury, I twist my<br>
legs round his naked loins, the flesh of which, so firm, so springy to<br>
the touch, quivered again under the pressure; and now I had him every<br>
way encircled and begirt; and having drawn him home to me, I kept him<br>
fast there, as if I had sought to unite bodies with him at that point.<br>
This bred a pause of action, a pleasure stop, whilst that delicate<br>
glutton, my nether mouth, as full as it could hold, kept palating, with<br>
exquisite relish, the morsel that so deliciously ingorged it. But<br>
nature could not long endure a pleasure that it so highly provoked<br>
without satisfying it: pursuing then its darling end, the battery<br>
recommenced with redoubled exertion; nor lay I inactive on my side, but<br>
encountering him with all the impetuosity of motion I was mistress of,<br>
the downy cloth of our meeting mount was now of real use to break the<br>
violence of the tilt; and soon, indeed! the highwrought agitation, the<br>
sweet urgency of this to-and-fro friction, raised the titillation on me<br>
to its height; so that finding myself on the point of going, and loath<br>
to leave the tender partner of my joys behind me, I employed all the<br>
forwarding motions and arts my experience suggested to me, to promote<br>
his keeping me company to our journey&rsquo;s end. I not only then tightened<br>
the pleasure-girth round my restless inmate, by a secret spring of<br>
friction and compression that obeys the will in those parts, but stole<br>
my hand softly to that store bag of nature&rsquo;s prime sweets, which is so<br>
pleasingly attached to its conduit pipe, from which we receive them;<br>
there feeling, and most gently indeed, squeezing those tender globular<br>
reservoirs, the magic touch took instant effect, quickened, and brought<br>
on upon the spur the symptoms of that sweet agony, the melting moment<br>
of dissolution, when pleasure dies by pleasure, and the mysterious<br>
engine of it overcomes the titillation it has raised in those parts, by<br>
plying them with the stream of a warm liquid, that in itself the<br>
highest of all titillations, and which they thirstily express and draw<br>
in like the hot natured leach, which, to cool itself, tenaciously<br>
extracts all the moisture within its sphere of execution. Chiming then<br>
to me, with exquisite consent, as I melted away, his oily balsamic<br>
injection, mixing deliciously with the sluices in flow from me,<br>
sheathed and blunted all the stings of pleasure, whilst a voluptuous<br>
languor possest, and still maintained us motionless, and fast locked in<br>
one another&rsquo;s arms. Alas! that these delights should be no<br>
longer-lived; for now the point of pleasure, unedged by enjoyment, and<br>
all the brisk sensations flattened upon us, resigned us up to the cool<br>
cares of insipid life. Disengaging myself then from his embrace, I made<br>
him sensible of the reasons there were for his present leaving me; on<br>
which, though reluctantly, he put on his clothes, with as little<br>
expedition, however, as he could help, wantonly interrupting himself,<br>
between whiles, with kisses, touches and embraces I could not refuse<br>
myself to. Yet he happily returned to his master before he was missed;<br>
but, at taking leave, I forced him (for he had sentiments enough to<br>
refuse it) to receive money enough to buy a silver watch, that great<br>
article of subaltern finery, which he at length accepted of, as a<br>
remembrance he was carefully to preserve of my affections.<br>
<br>
And here, Madam, I ought, perhaps, to make you an apology for this<br>
minute detail of things, that dwelt so strongly upon my memory, after<br>
so deep an impression; but, besides that this intrigue bred one great<br>
revolution in my life, which historical truth requires I should not<br>
sink from you, may I not presume that so exalted a pleasure ought not<br>
to be ungratefully forgotten, or suppressed by me, because I found it<br>
in a character in low life; where, by the by, it is oftener met with,<br>
purer, and more unsophisticated, than among the false, ridiculous<br>
refinements with which the great suffer themselves to be so grossly<br>
cheated by their pride: the great! than whom, there exist few amongst<br>
those they call the vulgar, who are more ignorant of, or who cultivate<br>
less, the art of living than they do; they, I say, who for ever mistake<br>
things the most foreign to the nature of pleasure itself; whose capital<br>
favourite object is enjoyment of beauty, wherever that rare invaluable<br>
gift is found, without distinction of birth, or station.<br>
<br>
As love never had, so now revenge had no longer any share in my<br>
commerce in this handsome youth. The sole pleasures of enjoyment were<br>
now the link I held to him by: for though nature had done such great<br>
maters for him in his outward form, and especially in that superb piece<br>
of furniture she had so liberally enriched him with; though he was thus<br>
qualified to give the senses their richest feast, still there was<br>
something more wanting to create in me, and constitute the passion of<br>
love. Yet Will had very good qualities too: gentle, tractable, and,<br>
above all, grateful; silentious, even to a fault: he spoke, at any<br>
time, very little, but made it up emphatically with action; and, to do<br>
him justice, he never gave me the least reason to complain, either of<br>
any tendency to encroach upon me for the liberties I allowed him, or of<br>
his indiscretion in blabbing them. There is, then, a fatality in love,<br>
or have loved him I must; for he was really a treasure, a bit for the<br>
Bonne Bouche of a duchess; and, to say the truth, my liking for him was<br>
so extreme, that it was distinguishing very nicely to deny that I loved<br>
him.<br>
<br>
My happiness, however, with him did not last long, but found an end<br>
from my own imprudent neglect. After having taken even superfluous<br>
precautions against a discovery, our success in repeated meetings<br>
emboldened me to omit the barely necessary ones. About a month after<br>
our first intercourse, one fatal morning (the season Mr. H.... rarely<br>
or never visited me in) I was in my closet, where my toilet stood, in<br>
nothing but my shift, a bed gown and under petticoat. Will was with me,<br>
and both ever too well disposed to baulk an opportunity. For my part, a<br>
whim, a wanton toy had just taken me, and I had challenged my man to<br>
execute it on the spot, who hesitated not to comply with my humour: I<br>
was set in the arm chair, my shift and petticoat up, my thighs wide<br>
spread and mounted over the arms of the chair, presenting the fairest<br>
mark to Will&rsquo;s drawn weapon, which he stood in act to plunge into me,<br>
when, having neglected to secure the chamber door, and that of the<br>
closet standing a-jar, Mr. H.... stole in upon us, before either of us<br>
was aware, and saw us precisely in these convicting attitudes.<br>
<br>
I gave a great scream, and dropped my petticoat: the thunder-struck lad<br>
stood trembling and pale, waiting his sentence of death. Mr. H....<br>
looked sometimes at one, sometimes at the other, with a mixture of<br>
indignation and scorn; and, without saying a word, spun upon his heel<br>
and went out.<br>
<br>
As confused as I was, I heard him very distinctly turn the key, and<br>
lock the chamber door upon us, so that there was no escape but through<br>
the dining room, where he himself was walking about with distempered<br>
strides, stamping in a great chafe, and doubtless debating what he<br>
would do with us.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, poor William was frightened out of his senses, and,<br>
as much need as I had of spirits myself, I was obliged to employ them<br>
all to keep his a little up. The misfortune I had now brought upon him,<br>
endeared him the more to me, and I could have joyfully suffered any<br>
punishment he had not shared in. I watered, plentifully, with my tears,<br>
the face of the frightened youth, who sat, not having strength to<br>
stand, as cold and as lifeless as a statue.<br>
<br>
Presently Mr. H.... comes in to us again, and made us go before him<br>
into the dining room, trembling and dreading the issue, Mr. H.....sat<br>
down on a chair whilst we stood like criminals under examination; and,<br>
beginning with me, asked me, with an even firm tone of voice, neither<br>
soft nor severe, but cruelly indifferent, what I could say for myself,<br>
for having abused him in so unworthy a manner, with his own servant<br>
too, and how he had deserved this of me?<br>
<br>
Without adding to the guilt of my infidelity, that of an audacious<br>
defence of it, in the old style of a common kept miss, my answer was<br>
modest, and often interrupted by my tears, in substance as follows:<br>
&ldquo;That I never had a single thought of wronging him&rdquo; (which was true),<br>
&ldquo;till I had seen him taking the last liberties with my servant wench&rdquo;<br>
(here he coloured prodigiously), &ldquo;and that my resentment at that, which<br>
I was over-awed from giving vent to by complaints, or explanations with<br>
him, had driven me to a course that I did not pretend to justify; but<br>
that as to the young man, he was entirely faultless; for that, in the<br>
view of making him the instrument of my revenge, I had down right<br>
seduced him to what he had done; and therefore hoped, whatever he<br>
determined about me, he would distinguish between the guilty and the<br>
innocent; and that; for the rest, I was entirely at his mercy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. H.... on hearing what I said, hung his head a little; but instantly<br>
recovering himself, he said to me, as near as I can retain, to the<br>
following purpose:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Madam, I owe shame to myself, and confess you have fairly turned the<br>
tables upon me. It is not with one of your cast of breeding and<br>
sentiments, that I allow you so much reason on your side, as great<br>
difference of the provocations: be it sufficient that I should enter<br>
into a discussion of the very to have changed my resolution, in<br>
consideration of what you reproach me with; and I own, too, that your<br>
clearing that rascal there, is fair and honest in you. Renew with you I<br>
cannot: the affront is too gross. I give you a week&rsquo;s warning to get<br>
out of these lodgings; whatever I have given you, remains to you; and<br>
as I never intend to see you more, the landlord will pay you fifty<br>
pieces on my account, with which, and every debt paid, I hope you will<br>
own I do not leave you in a worse condition than what I took you up in,<br>
or that you deserve of me. Blame yourself only that it is no better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then, without giving me time to reply, he addressed himself to the<br>
young fellow:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;For you, spark, I shall, for your father&rsquo;s sake, take care of you: the<br>
town is no place for such an easy fool as thou art; and to-morrow you<br>
shall set out, under the charge of one of my men, well recommended, in<br>
my name, to your father, not to let you return and be spoil&rsquo;d here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At these words he went out, after my vainly attempting to stop him, by<br>
throwing myself at his feet. He shook me off, though he seemed greatly<br>
moved too, and took Will away with him, who, I dare swear, thought<br>
himself very cheaply off.<br>
<br>
I was now once more a-drift, and left upon my own hands, by a gentleman<br>
whom I certainly did not deserve. And all the letters, arts, friends,<br>
entreaties that I employed within the week of grace in my lodging,<br>
could never win on him so much as to see me again. He had irrevocably<br>
pronounced my doom, and submission to it was my only part. Soon after<br>
he married a lady of birth and fortune, to whom, I have heard he proved<br>
an irreproachable husband.<br>
<br>
As for poor Will, he was immediately sent down to the country to his<br>
father, who was an easy farmer, where he was not four months before an<br>
inn-keepers&rsquo; buxom young widow, with a very good stock, both in money<br>
and trade, fancied, and perhaps pre-acquainted with his secret<br>
excellencies, married him: and I am sure there was, at least, one good<br>
foundation for their living happily together.<br>
<br>
Though I should have been charmed to see him before he went, such<br>
measures were taken, by Mr. H....&rsquo;s orders, that it was impossible;<br>
otherwise I should certainly have endeavoured to detain him in town,<br>
and would have spared neither offers nor expense to have procured<br>
myself the satisfaction of keeping him with me. He had such powerful<br>
holds upon my inclinations as were not easily to be shaken off, or<br>
replaced; as to my heart, it was quite out of the question: glad,<br>
however, I was from my soul, that nothing worse, and as things turned<br>
out, nothing better could have happened to him.<br>
<br>
As to Mr. H..., though views of conveniency made me, at first, exert<br>
myself to regain his affection, I was giddy and thoughtless enough to<br>
be much easier reconciled to my failure than I ought to have been; but<br>
as I never had loved him, and his leaving me gave me a sort of liberty<br>
that I had often longed for, I was soon comforted; and flattering<br>
myself, that the stock of youth and beauty I was going to trade with,<br>
could hardly fail of procuring me a maintenance, I saw myself under the<br>
necessity of trying my fortune with them, rather, with pleasure and<br>
gaiety, than with the least idea of despondency.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, several of my acquaintances among the sisterhood, who<br>
had soon got wind of my misfortune, flocked to insult me with their<br>
malicious consolations. Most of them had long envied me the affluence<br>
and splendour I had been maintained in; and though there was scarce one<br>
of them that did not at least deserve to be in my case, and would<br>
probably, sooner or later, come to it, it was equally easy to remark,<br>
even in their affected pity, their secret pleasure at seeing me thus<br>
discarded, and their secret grief that it was no worse with me.<br>
Unaccountable malice of the human heart! and which is not confined to<br>
the class of life they were of.<br>
<br>
But as the time approached for me to come to some resolution how to<br>
dispose of myself, and I was considering, round where to shift my<br>
quarters to, Mrs. Cole, a middle aged discreet sort of woman, who had<br>
been brought into my acquaintance by one of the misses that visited me,<br>
upon learning my situation, came to offer her cordial advice and<br>
service to me; and as I had always taken to her more than to any of my<br>
female acquaintances, I listened the easier to her proposals. And, as<br>
it happened, I could not have put myself into worse, or into better<br>
hands in all London: into worse, because keeping a house of<br>
conveniency, there were no lengths in lewdness she would not advise me<br>
to go, in compliance with her customers; no schemes, or pleasure, or<br>
even unbounded debauchery, she did not take even a delight in<br>
promoting: into a better, because nobody having had more experience of<br>
the wicked part of the town than she had, was fitter to advise and<br>
guard one against the worst dangers of our profession; and what was<br>
rare to be met with in those of her&rsquo;s, she contented herself with a<br>
moderate living profit upon her industry and good offices, and had<br>
nothing of their greedy rapacious turn. She was really too a<br>
gentlewoman born and bred, but through a train of accidents reduced to<br>
this course, which she pursued, partly through necessity, partly<br>
through choice, as never woman delighted more in encouraging a brisk<br>
circulation of the trade, for the sake of the trade itself, or better<br>
understood all the mysteries and refinements of it, than she did; so<br>
that she was consummately at the top of her profession, and dealt only<br>
with customers of distinction: to answer the demands of whom she kept a<br>
competent number of her daughters in constant recruit (so she called<br>
those whom their youth and personal charms recommended to her adoption<br>
and management: several of whom, by her means, and through her tuition<br>
and instructions, succeeded very well in the world).<br>
<br>
This useful gentlewoman upon whose protection I now threw myself,<br>
having her reasons of state, respecting Mr. H...., for not appearing<br>
too much in the thing herself, sent a friend of her&rsquo;s, on the day<br>
appointed for my removal, to conduct me to my new lodgings at a<br>
brush-maker&rsquo;s in E&mdash;&mdash; street, Covent Garden, the very next door to her<br>
own house, where she had no conveniences to lodge me herself: lodgings<br>
that, by having been for several successions tenanted by ladies of<br>
pleasures, the landlord of them was familiarized to their ways; and<br>
provided the rent was paid, every thing else was as easy and commodious<br>
as one could desire.<br>
<br>
The fifty guineas promised me by Mr. H...., at his parting with me,<br>
having been duly paid me, all my clothes and moveables chested up,<br>
which were at least of two hundred pounds value, I had them conveyed<br>
into a coach, where I soon followed them, after taking a civil leave of<br>
the landlord and his family, with whom I had never lived in a degree of<br>
familiarity enough to regret the removal; but still, the very<br>
circumstance of its being a removal, drew tears from me. I left, too, a<br>
letter of thanks for Mr. H...., from whom I concluded myself, as I<br>
really was, irretrievably separated.<br>
<br>
My maid I had discharged the day before, not only because I had her of<br>
Mr. H...., but that I suspected her of having some how or other been<br>
the occasion of his discovering me, in revenge, perhaps, for my not<br>
having trusted her with him.<br>
<br>
We soon got to my lodgings, which, though not so handsomely furnished,<br>
nor so showy as those I left, were to the full as convenient, and at<br>
half price, though on the first floor. My trunks were safely landed,<br>
and stowed in my apartments, where my neighbour, and now gouvernante,<br>
Mrs. Cole, was ready with my landlord to receive me, to whom she took<br>
care to set me out in the most favourable light, that of one from whom<br>
there was the clearest reason to expect the regular payment of his<br>
rent: all the cardinal virtues attributed to me, would not have had<br>
half the weight of that recommendation alone.<br>
<br>
I was now settled in lodgings of my own, abandoned to my own conduct,<br>
and turned loose upon the town, to sink or swim, as I could manage with<br>
the current of it; and what were the consequences, together with the<br>
number of adventures which befell me in the exercise of my new<br>
profession, will compose the mater of another letter: for surely it is<br>
high time to put a period! to this.<br>
<br>
I am,<br>
<br>
MADAM,<br>
<br>
Yours, etc., etc., etc.<br>
<br>
THE END OF THE FIRST LETTER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
LETTER THE SECOND<br>
<br>
Madam,<br>
<br>
If I have delayed the sequel of my history, it has been purely to allow<br>
myself a little breathing time not without some hopes, that, instead of<br>
pressing me to a continuation, you would have acquitted me of the task<br>
of pursuing a confession, in the course of which my self-esteem has so<br>
many wounds to sustain.<br>
<br>
I imagined, indeed, that you would have been cloyed and tired with<br>
uniformity of adventures and expressions, inseparable from a subject of<br>
this sort, whose bottom, or groundwork being, in the nature of things<br>
eternally one and the same, whatever variety of forms and modes the<br>
situations are susceptible of, there is no escaping a repetition of<br>
near the same images, the same figures, the same expressions, with this<br>
further inconvenience added to the disgust it creates, that the words<br>
Joys, Ardours, Transports, Extasies and the rest of those pathetic<br>
terms so congenial to, so received in the Practice of Pleasure, flatten<br>
and lose much of their due spirit and energy by the frequency they<br>
indispensably recur with, in a narrative of which that Practice<br>
professedly composes the whole basis. I must therefore trust to the<br>
candour of your judgment, for your allowing for the disadvantage I am<br>
necessarily under in that respect; and to your imagination and<br>
sensibility, the pleasing taks of repairing it, by their supplements,<br>
where my descriptions flag or fail: the one will readily place the<br>
pictures I present before your eyes; the other give life to the colours<br>
where they are dull, or worn with too frequent handling.<br>
<br>
What you say besides, by way of encouragement concerning the extreme<br>
difficulty of continuing so long in one strain, in a mean tempered with<br>
taste, between the revoltingness of gross, rank and vulgar expressions,<br>
and the ridicule of mincing metaphors and affected circumlocutions, is<br>
so sensible, as well as good-natured, that you greatly justify me to<br>
myself for my compliance with a curiosity that is to be satisfied so<br>
extremely at my expense.<br>
<br>
Resuming now where I broke off in my last, I am in my way to remark to<br>
you, that it was late in the evening before I arrived at my lodgings,<br>
and Mrs. Cole, after helping me to range and secure my things, spent<br>
the whole evening with me in my apartment, where we supped together, in<br>
giving me the best advice and instruction with regard to the new stage<br>
of my profession I was now to enter upon; and passing thus from a<br>
private devotee to pleasure into a public one, to become a more general<br>
good, with all the advantages requisite to put my person out to use,<br>
either for interest or pleasure, or both. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;as<br>
I was a kind of new face upon the town, that is, was an established<br>
rule, and part of trade, for me to pass for a maid and dispose of<br>
myself as such on the first good occasion, without prejudice, however,<br>
to such diversions as I might have a mind to in the interim; for that<br>
nobody could be a greater enemy than she was to the losing of time.<br>
That she would, in the mean time, do her best to find out a proper<br>
person, and would undertake to manage this nice point for me, if I<br>
would accept of her aid and advice to such good purpose, that, in the<br>
loss of a fictitious maidenhead, I should reap all the advantages of a<br>
native one.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
As too great a delicacy of sentiments did not extremely belong to my<br>
character at that time, I confess, against myself, that I perhaps too<br>
readily closed with a proposal which my candor and ingenuity gave me<br>
some repugnance to: but not enough to contradict the intention of one<br>
to whom I had now thoroughly abandoned the direction of all my steps.<br>
For Mrs. Cole had, I do not know how unless by one of those<br>
unaccountable invincible sympathies that, nevertheless, from the<br>
strongest links, especially of female friendship, won and got entire<br>
possession of me. On her side, she pretended that a strict resemblance,<br>
she fancied she saw in me, to an only daughter whom she had lost at my<br>
age, was the first motive of her taking to me so affectionately as she<br>
did. It might be so: there exist a slender motives of attachment, that,<br>
gathering force from habit and liking, have proved often more solid and<br>
durable than those founded on much stronger reasons; but this I know,<br>
that though I had no other acquaintance with her, than seeing her at my<br>
lodgings, when I lived with Mr. H..., where she had made errands to<br>
sell me some millinery ware, she had by degrees insinuated herself so<br>
far into my confidence, that I threw myself blindly into her hands, and<br>
came, at length, to regard, love, and obey her implicitly; and, to do<br>
her justice, I never experienced at her hands other than a sincerity of<br>
tenderness, and care for my interest, hardly heard of in those of her<br>
profession. We parted that night, after having settled a perfect<br>
unreserved agreement; and the next morning Mrs. Cole came, and took me<br>
with her to her house for the first time.<br>
<br>
Here, at the first sight of things, I found every thing breathe an air<br>
of decency, modesty and order.<br>
<br>
In the outer parlour, or rather shop, sat three young women, rather<br>
demurely employed on millinery work, which was the cover of a traffic<br>
in more precious commodities; but three beautifuller creatures could<br>
hardly be seen. Two of them were extremely fair, the eldest not above<br>
nineteen; and the third, much about that age, was a piquant brunette,<br>
whose black sparking eyes, and perfect harmony of features and shape,<br>
left her nothing to envy in her fairer companions. Their dress too had<br>
the more design in it, the less it appeared to have, being in a taste<br>
of uniform correct neatness, and elegant simplicity. These were the<br>
girls that composed the small domestic flock, which my governess<br>
trained up with surprising order and management, considering the giddy<br>
wildness of young girls once got upon the loose. But then she never<br>
continued any in her house, whom, after a due noviciate, she found<br>
un-tractable, or unwilling to comply with the rules of it. Thus she had<br>
insensibly formed a little family of love, in which the members found<br>
so sensibly their account, in a rare alliance of pleasure and interest,<br>
and of a necessary outward decency, with unbounded secret liberty, that<br>
Mrs. Cole, who had picked them as much for their temper as their<br>
beauty, governed them with ease to herself and them too.<br>
<br>
To these pupils then of hers, whom she had prepared, she presented me<br>
as a new boarder, and one that was to be immediately admitted to all<br>
the intimacies of the house; upon which these charming girls gave me<br>
all the marks of a welcome reception, and indeed of being perfectly<br>
pleased with my figure, that I could possibly expect from any of my own<br>
sex: but they had been effectually brought to sacrifice all jealousy,<br>
or competition of charms, to a common interest, and considered me a<br>
partner that was bringing no despicable stock of goods into the trade<br>
of the house. They gathered round me, viewed me on all sides; and as my<br>
admission into this joyous troop made a little holiday, the shew of<br>
work was laid aside; and Mrs. Cole giving me up, with special<br>
recommendation, to their caresses and entertainment, went about her<br>
ordinary business of the house.<br>
<br>
The sameness of our sex, age, profession, and views, soon creased as<br>
unreserved a freedom and intimacy as if we had been for years<br>
acquainted. They took and shewed me the house, their respective<br>
apartments, which were furnished with every article of convenience and<br>
luxury; and above all, a spacious drawing-room, where a select<br>
revelling band usually met, in general parties of pleasure; the girls<br>
supping with their sparks, and acting their wanton pranks with<br>
unbounded licentiousness; whilst a defiance of awe, modesty or jealousy<br>
were their standing rules, by which, according to the principles of<br>
their society, whatever pleasure was lost on the side of sentiment, was<br>
abundantly made up to the senses in the poignancy of variety, and the<br>
charms of ease and luxury. The authors and supporters of this secret<br>
institution would, in the height of their humour, style themselves the<br>
restorers of the golden age and its simplicity of pleasures, before<br>
their innocence became so unjustly branded with the names of guilt and<br>
shame.<br>
<br>
As soon then as the evening began, and the shew of a shop was shut, the<br>
academy opened; the mask of mock-modesty was completely taken off, and<br>
all the girls delivered over to their respective calls of pleasure or<br>
interest with their men: and none of that sex was promiscuously<br>
admitted, but only such as Mrs. Cole was previously satisfied with<br>
their character and discretion. In short, this was the safest,<br>
politest, and, at the same time, the most thorough house of<br>
accommodation in town: every thing being conducted so, that decency<br>
made no intrenchment upon the most libertine pleasures; in the practice<br>
of which, too, the choice familiars of the house had found the secret<br>
so rare and difficult, of reconciling even all the refinements of taste<br>
and delicacy, with the most gross and determinate gratifications of<br>
sensuality.<br>
<br>
After having consumed the morning in the dear endearments and<br>
instructions of my new acquaintance, we went to dinner, when Mrs. Cole,<br>
presiding at the head of her club, gave me the first idea of her<br>
management and address, in inspiring these girls with so sensible a<br>
love and respect for her. There was no stiffness, no reserve, no airs<br>
of pique, or little jealousies, but all was unaffectedly gay, cheerful<br>
and easy.<br>
<br>
After dinner, Mrs. Cole, seconded by the young ladies, acquainted me<br>
that there was a chapter to be held that night in form, for the<br>
ceremony of my reception into the sisterhood; and in which, with all<br>
due reserve to my maidenhead, that was to be occasionally cooked up for<br>
the first proper chapman. I was to undergo a ceremonial of initiation<br>
they were sure I should not be displeased with.<br>
<br>
Embarked as I was, and moreover captivated with the charms of my new<br>
companions, I was too much prejudiced in favour of any proposal they<br>
could make, to as much as hesitate an assent; which, therefore, readily<br>
giving in the style of a carte blanche, I received fresh kisses of<br>
compliment from them all, in approval of my docility and good nature.<br>
Now I was &ldquo;a sweet girl... I came into things with a good grace... I<br>
was not affectedly coy... I should be the pride of the house,&rdquo; and the<br>
like.<br>
<br>
This point thus adjusted, the young women left Mrs. Cole to talk and<br>
concert matters with me, when she explained to me, that &ldquo;I should be<br>
introduced that very evening, to four of her best friends, one of whom<br>
she had, according to the custom of the house, favoured with the<br>
preference of engaging me in the first party of pleasure;&rdquo; assuring me,<br>
at the same time, &ldquo;that they were all young gentlemen agreeable in<br>
their persons, and unexceptionable in every respect; that united, and<br>
holding together by the band of common pleasures, they composed the<br>
chief support of her house, and made very liberal presents to the girls<br>
that pleased and humoured them, so that they were, properly speaking,<br>
the founders and patrons of this little seraglio. Not but that she had,<br>
at proper seasons, other customers to deal with, whom she stood less<br>
upon punctilio with, than with these; for instance, it was not on one<br>
of them she could attempt to pass me for a maid; they were not only too<br>
knowing, too much town-bred to bite at such a bait, but they were such<br>
generous benefactors to her, that it would be unpardonable to think of<br>
it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Amidst all the flutter and emotion which this promise of pleasure, for<br>
such I conceived it, stirred up in me, I preserved so much of the<br>
woman, as to feign just reluctance enough to make some merit, of<br>
sacrificing it to the influence of my patroness, whom I likewise, still<br>
in character, reminded of it perhaps being right for me to go home and<br>
dress, in favour of my first impressions.<br>
<br>
But Mrs. Cole, in opposition to this, assured me, &ldquo;that the gentlemen I<br>
should be presented to were, by their rank and taste of things,<br>
infinitely superior to the being touched with any glare of dress or<br>
ornaments, such slick women rather confound and overlay than set off<br>
their beauty with; that these veteran voluptuaries knew better than not<br>
to hold them in the highest contempt: they with whom the pure native<br>
charms alone could pass current, and who would at any time leave a<br>
sallow, washy, painted duchess on her own hands, for a ruddy, healthy<br>
firm fleshed country maid; and as for my part, that nature had done<br>
enough for me, to set me above owing the least favour to art;&rdquo;<br>
concluding withal, that for the instant occasion, there was no dress<br>
like an undress.<br>
<br>
I thought my governess too good a judge of these matters, not to be<br>
easily overruled by her: after which she went on preaching very<br>
pathetically the doctrine of passive obedience and non-resistance to<br>
all those arbitrary tastes of pleasure, which are by some styled the<br>
refinements, and by others the depravations of it; between whom it was<br>
not the business of a simple girl, who was to profit by pleasing, to<br>
decide, but to conform to. Whilst I was edifying by these wholesome<br>
lessons, tea was brought in, and the young ladies, returning, joined<br>
company with us.<br>
<br>
After a great deal of mixed chat, frolic and humour, one of them,<br>
observing that there would be a good deal of time on and before the<br>
assembly hour, proposed that each girl should entertain the company<br>
with that critical period of her personal history, in which she first<br>
exchanged the maiden state for womanhood. The proposal was approved,<br>
with only one restriction of Mrs. Cole, that she, on account of her<br>
age, and I, on account of my titular maidenhead, should be excused, at<br>
least till I had undergone the forms of the house. This obtained me a<br>
dispensation, and the promotress of this amusement was desired to<br>
begin.<br>
<br>
Her name was Emily; a girl fair to excess, and whose limbs were, if<br>
possible, too well made, since their plump fulness was rather to the<br>
prejudice of that delicate slimness required by the nicer judges of<br>
beauty; her eyes were blue, and streamed inexpressible sweetness, and<br>
nothing could be prettier than her mouth and lips, which closed over a<br>
range of the evenest and whitest teeth. Thus she began:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Neither my extraction, nor the most critical adventure of my life, is<br>
sublime enough to impeach me of any vanity in the advancement of the<br>
proposal you have approved of. My father and mother were, and for aught<br>
I know, are still, farmers in the country, not above forty miles from<br>
town: their barbarity to me, in favour of a son, on whom alone they<br>
vouchsafed to bestow their tenderness, had a thousand times determined<br>
me to fly their house, and throw myself on the wide world; but, at<br>
length, an accident forced me on this desperate attempt at the age of<br>
fifteen. I had broken a chinabowl, the pride and idol of both their<br>
hearts; and as an unmerciful beating was the least I had to depend on<br>
at their hands, in the silliness of these tender years, I left the<br>
house, and, at all adventures, took the road to London. How my loss was<br>
resented I do not know, for till this instant I have not heard a<br>
syllable about them. My whole stock was two broad pieces of my<br>
godmother&rsquo;s, a few shillings, silver shoe-buckles and a silver thimble.<br>
Thus equipped, with no more clothes than the ordinary ones I had on my<br>
back, and frightened at every foot or noise I heard behind me, I<br>
hurried on; and I dare sweare, walked a dozen miles before I stopped,<br>
through mere weariness and fatigue. At length I sat down on a style,<br>
wept bitterly, and yet was still rather under increased impressions of<br>
fear on the account of my escape; which made me dread, worse than<br>
death, the going back to my unnatural parents. Refreshed by this little<br>
repose, and relieved by my tears, I was proceeding onward, when I was<br>
overtaken by a sturdy country lad, who was going to London to see what<br>
he could do for himself there, and, like me, had given his friends the<br>
slip. He could not be above seventeen, was ruddy, well featured enough,<br>
with uncombed flaxen hair, a little flapped hat, kersey frock, yarn<br>
stockings, in short, a perfect plough boy. I saw him come whistling<br>
behind me, with a bundle tied to the end of a stick, his travelling<br>
equipage. We walked by one another for some time without speaking; at<br>
length we joined company, and agreed to keep together till we got to<br>
our journey&rsquo;s end; what his designs or ideas were, I know not: the<br>
innocence of mine I can solemnly protest.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As night drew on, it became us to look out for some inn or shelter; to<br>
which perplexity another was added, and that was, what we should say<br>
for ourselves, if we were questioned. After some puzzle, the young<br>
fellow started a proposal, which I thought the finest that could be;<br>
and what was that? why, that we should pass for husband and wife: I<br>
never dreamed of consequences. We came presently, after having agreed<br>
on this notable experience, to one of those hedge accommodations for<br>
foot passengers, at the door of which stood an old crazy beldam, who<br>
seeing us trudge by, invited us to lodge there. Glad of any cover, we<br>
went in, and my fellow traveller, taking all upon him, called for what<br>
the house afforded, and we supped together as man and wife; which,<br>
considering our figures and ages, could not have passed on any one but<br>
such as any thing could pass on. But when bed-time came on, we had<br>
neither of us the courage to contradict our first account of ourselves;<br>
and what was extremely pleasant, the young lad seemed as perplexed as I<br>
was how to evade lying together, which was so natural for the state we<br>
had pretended to. Whilst we were in this quandary, the landlady takes<br>
the candles, and lights us to our apartment, through a long yard, at<br>
the end of which it stood, separate from the body of the house. Thus we<br>
suffered ourselves to be conducted, without saying a word in opposition<br>
to it; and there, in a wretched room, with a bed answerable, we were<br>
left to pass the night together, as a thing quite of course. For my<br>
part, I was so incredibly innocent, as not even to think much more harm<br>
of going into bed with the young man, than with one of our dairy<br>
wenches; nor had he, perhaps, any other notions than those of<br>
innocence, till such a fair occasion put them into his head.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Before either of us undressed, however, he put out the candle; and the<br>
bitterness of the weather made it a kind of necessity for me to go into<br>
bed: slipping then my clothes off, I crept under the bedclothes, where<br>
I found the young stripling already nestled, and the touch of his warm<br>
flesh rather pleased than alarmed me. I was indeed too much disturbed<br>
with the novelty of my condition to be able to sleep; but then I had<br>
not the least thought of harm. But oh! how powerful are the instincts<br>
of nature! how little is there wanting to set them in action! The young<br>
man, sliding his arm under my body, drew me gently towards him, as if<br>
to keep himself and me warmer; and the heat I felt from joining our<br>
breasts, kindled another that I had hitherto never felt, and was, even<br>
then, a stranger to the nature of. Emboldened, I suppose, by my<br>
easiness, he ventured to kiss me, and I insensibly returned it; without<br>
knowing the consequence of returning it: for, on this encouragement, he<br>
slipped his hand all down from my breast to that part of me where the<br>
sense of feeling is so exquisitely critical, as I then experienced by<br>
its instant taking fire upon the touch, and glowing with a strange<br>
tickling heat: there he pleased himself and me, by feeling, till<br>
growing a little too bold with me, he hurt me, and made me complain.<br>
Then he took my hand, which he guided, not unwillingly on my side,<br>
between the twist of his closed thighs, which were extremely warm;<br>
there he lodged and pressed it, till raising it by degrees, he made me<br>
feel the proud distinction of his sex from mine. I was frightened at<br>
the novelty, and drew back my hand; yet, pressed and spurred on by<br>
sensations of a strange pleasure, I could not help asking him what that<br>
was for? He told me he would shew me if I would let him; and without<br>
waiting for my answer, which he prevented by stopping my mouth with<br>
kisses I was far from disrelishing, he got upon me, and inserting one<br>
of his thighs between mine, opened them so as to make way for himself,<br>
and fixed me to his purpose; whilst I was so much out of my usual<br>
sense, so subdued by the present power of a new one, that, between far<br>
and desire, I lay utter passive, till the piercing pain rouzed and made<br>
me cry out. But it was too late: he was too firm fixed in the saddle<br>
for me to compass flinging him, with all the struggles I could use,<br>
some of which only served to further his point, and at length an<br>
irresistible thrust murdered at once my maidenhead, and almost me. I<br>
now lay a bleeding witness of the necessity imposed on our sex, to<br>
gather the first honey off the thorns.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But the pleasure rising as the pain subsided, I was soon reconciled to<br>
fresh trials, and before morning, nothing on earth could be dearer to<br>
me than this rifler of my virgin sweets: he was every thing to me now.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;How we agreed to join fortunes: how we came up to town together, where<br>
we lived some time, till necessity-parted us, and drove me into this<br>
course of life, to which I had been long ago bettered and torn to<br>
pieces before I came to this age, as much through my easiness, as<br>
through inclination, had it not been for my finding refuge in this<br>
house: these are all circumstances which pass the mark I proposed, so<br>
that here my narrative ends.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In the order of our sitting, it was Harriet&rsquo;s turn to go on. Amongst<br>
all the beauties of our sex, that I had before, or have since seen, few<br>
indeed were the forms that could dispute excellence with her&rsquo;s; it was<br>
not delicate, but delicacy itself incarnate, such was the symmetry of<br>
her small but exactly fashioned limbs. Her complexion, fair as it was,<br>
appeared yet more fair, from the effect of two black eyes, the<br>
brilliancy of which gave her face more vivacity than belonged to the<br>
colour of it, which was only defended from paleness, by a sweetly<br>
pleasing blush in her cheeks, that grew fainter and fainter, till at<br>
length it died away insensibly into the overbearing white. Then her<br>
miniature features joined to finish the extreme sweetness of it, which<br>
was not belied by that of a temper turned to indolence, languor, and<br>
the pleasures of love. Pressed to subscribe her contingent, she smiled,<br>
blushed a little, and thus complied with our desires:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My father was neither better nor worse than a miller near the city of<br>
York; and both he and my mother dying whilst I was an infant, I fell<br>
under the care of a widow and childless aunt, housekeeper to my lord<br>
N..., at his seat in the county of..., where she brought me up with all<br>
imaginable tenderness. I was not seventeen, as I am not now eighteen,<br>
before I had, on account of my person purely (for fortune I had<br>
notoriously none), several advantageous proposals; but whether nature<br>
was slow in making me sensible in her favourite passion, or that I had<br>
not seen any of the other sex who had stirred up the least emotion or<br>
curiosity to be better acquainted with it, I had, till that age,<br>
preserved a perfect innocence, even of thought: whilst my fears of I<br>
did not now well know what, made me no more desirous of marrying than<br>
of dying. My aunt, good woman, favoured my timorousness, which she<br>
looked on as childish affection, that her own experience might<br>
probably assure her would wear off in time, and gave my suitors proper<br>
answers for me.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The family had not been down at that seat for years, so that it was<br>
neglected, and committed entirely to my aunt, and two old domestics to<br>
take care of it. Thus I had the full range of a spacious lonely house<br>
and gardens, situated at about half a mile distance from any other<br>
habitation, except, perhaps, a straggling cottage or so.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here, in tranquillity and innocence, I grew up without any memorable<br>
accident, till one fatal day I had, as I had often done before, left my<br>
aunt asleep, and secure for some hours, after dinner; and resorting to<br>
a kind of ancient summer house, at some distance from the house, I<br>
carried my work with me, and sat over a rivulet, which its door and<br>
window faced upon. Here I fell into a gentle breathing slumber, which<br>
stole upon my senses, as they fainted under the excessive heat of the<br>
season at that hour; a cane couch, with my work basked for a pillow,<br>
were all the conveniences of my short repose; for I was soon awaked and<br>
alarmed by a flounce, and noise of splashing in the water. I got up to<br>
see what was the matter; and what indeed should it be but the son of a<br>
neighbouring gentleman, as I afterwards found (for I had never seen him<br>
before), who had strayed that way with his gun, and heated by his<br>
sport, and the sultriness of the day, had been tempted by the freshness<br>
of the clear stream; so that presently stripping, he jumped into it on<br>
the other side, which bordered on a wood, some trees whereof, inclined<br>
down to the water, formed a pleasing shady recess, commodious to<br>
undress and leave his clothes under.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My first emotions at the sight of this youth, naked in the water,<br>
were, with all imaginable respect to truth, those of surprise and fear;<br>
and, in course, I should immediately have run out, had not my modesty,<br>
fatally for itself, interposed the objection of the door and window<br>
being so situated, that it was scarce possible to get out, and make my<br>
way along the bank to the house, without his seeing me: which I could<br>
not bear the thought of, so much ashamed and confounded was I at having<br>
seen him. Condemned then to stay till his departure should release me,<br>
I was greatly embarrassed how to dispose of myself: I kept some time<br>
betwixt terror and modesty, even from looking through the window, which<br>
being an old fashioned casement, without any light behind me, could<br>
hardly betray any one&rsquo;s being there to him from within; then the door<br>
was so secure, that without violence, or my own consent, there was no<br>
opening it from without.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But now, by my own experience, I found it too true, that objects which<br>
affright us, when we cannot get from them, draw our eyes as forcibly as<br>
those that please us. I could not long withstand that nameless impulse,<br>
which, without any desire of this novel sight, compelled me towards it;<br>
emboldened too by my certainty of being at once unseen and safe, I<br>
ventured by degrees to cast my eyes on an object so terrible and<br>
alarming to my virgin modesty as a naked man.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But as I snatched a look, the first gleam that struck me, was in<br>
general the dewy lustre of the whitest skin imaginable, which the sun<br>
playing upon made the reflection of it perfectly beamy. His face, in<br>
the confusion I was in, I could not well distinguish the lineamints of,<br>
any farther than that there was a great deal of youth and freshness in<br>
it. The frolic and various play of all his fine polished limbs, as they<br>
appeared above the surface, in the course of his swimming or wantoning<br>
with the water, amused and insensibly delighted me; sometimes he lay<br>
motionless, on his back, waterborne, and dragging after him a fine head<br>
of hair, that, floating, swept the stream in a bush of black curls.<br>
Then the overflowing water would make a separation between his breast<br>
and glossy white belly; at the bottom of which I could not escape<br>
observing so remarkable a distinction, as a black mossy tuft, out of<br>
which appeared to emerge a round, softish, limber, white something,<br>
that played every way, with ever the least motion or whirling eddy. I<br>
cannot say but that part chiefly, by a kind of natural instinct,<br>
attracted, detained, captivated my attention: it was out of the power<br>
of all my modesty to command my eye away from it; and seeing nothing so<br>
very dreadful in its appearance, I insensibly looked away all my fears:<br>
but as fast as they gave way, new desires and strange wishes took<br>
place, and I melted as I gazed. The fire of nature, that had so long<br>
lain dormant or concealed, began to break out, and made me feel my sex<br>
for the first time. He had now changed his posture, and swam prone on<br>
his belly, striking out with his legs and arms; finer modeled than<br>
which could not have been cast, whilst his floating locks played over a<br>
neck and shoulders whose whiteness they delightfully set off. Then the<br>
luxuriant swell of flesh that rose from the small of his back, and<br>
terminates its double cope at where the thighs are set off, perfectly<br>
dazzled one with its watery glistening gloss.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By this time I was so affected by this inward involution of<br>
sentiments, so softened by this sight, that now, betrayed into a sudden<br>
transition from extreme fears to extreme desires, I found these last so<br>
strong upon me, the heat of the weather too perhaps conspiring to exalt<br>
their rage, that nature almost fainted under them. Not that I so much<br>
as knew precisely what was wanting to me: my only thought was, that so<br>
sweet a creature, as this youth seemed to me, could only make me happy;<br>
but then, the little likelihood there was of compassing an acquaintance<br>
with him, or perhaps of ever seeing him again, dashed my desires, and<br>
turned them into torments. I was still gazing, with all the powers of<br>
my sight, on this bewitching object, when, in an instant, down he went.<br>
I had heard of such things as a cramp seizing on even the best<br>
swimmers, and occasioning their being drowned; and imagining this so<br>
sudden eclipse to be owing to it, the inconceivable fondness this<br>
unknown lad had given birth to, distracted me with the most killing<br>
terrors; insomuch, that my concern giving the wings, I flew to the<br>
door, opened it, ran down to the canal, guided thither by the madness<br>
of my fears for him, and the intense desire of being an instrument to<br>
save him, though I was ignorant how, or by what means to effect it: but<br>
was it for fears, and a passion so sudden as mine, to reason! All this<br>
took up scarce the space of a few moments. I had then just life enough<br>
to reach the green borders of the waterpiece, where wildly looking<br>
round for the young man, and missing him still, my fright and concern<br>
sunk me down in a deep swoon, which must have lasted me some time; for<br>
I did not come to myself, till I was roused out of it by a sense of<br>
pain that pierced me to the vitals, and awaked me to the the most<br>
surprising circumstance of finding myself not only in the arms of this<br>
very young gentleman I had been so solicitous to save; but taken at<br>
such an advantage in my unresisting condition, that he had actually<br>
completed his entrance into me so far, that weakened as I was by all<br>
the preceding conflicts of mind I had suffered, and struck dumb by the<br>
violence of my surprise, I had neither the power to cry out, nor the<br>
strength to disengage myself from his strenuous embraces, before,<br>
urging his point, he had forced his way and completely triumphed over<br>
my virginity, as he might now as well see by the streams of blood that<br>
followed his drawing out, as he had felt by the difficulties he had met<br>
with consummating his penetration. But the sight of the blood, and the<br>
sense of my condition, had (as he told me afterwards), since the<br>
ungovernable rage of his passion was somewhat appeased, now wrought so<br>
far on him, that at all risks, even of the worst consequences, he could<br>
not find in his heart to leave me, and make off, which he might easily<br>
have done. I still lay all discomposed in bleeding ruin, palpitating,<br>
speechless, unable to get off, and frightened, and fluttering like a<br>
poor wounded partridge, and ready to faint away again at the sense of<br>
what had befallen me. The young gentleman was by me, kneeling, kissing<br>
my hand, and with tears in his eyes, beseeching me to forgive him, and<br>
offering all the reparation in his power. It is certain that could I,<br>
at the instant of regaining my senses, have called out, or taken the<br>
bloodiest revenge, I would not be stuck at it; the violation was<br>
attended too with such aggravating circumstances, though he was<br>
ignorant of them, since it was to my concern for the preservation of<br>
his life, that I owed my ruin.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But how quick is the shift of passions from one extreme to another!<br>
and how little are they acquainted with the human heart who dispute it!<br>
I could not see this amiable criminal, so suddenly the first object of<br>
my love, and as suddenly of my just hate, on his knees, bedewing my<br>
hands with his tears, without relenting. He was still stark-naked, but<br>
my modesty had been already too much wounded, in essentials, to be so<br>
much shocked as I should have otherwise been with appearances only; in<br>
short, my anger ebbed so fast, and the tide of love returned so strong<br>
upon me, that I felt it a point of my own happiness to forgive him. The<br>
reproaches I made him were murmured in so soft a tone, my eyes met his<br>
with such glances, expressing more languor than resentment, that he<br>
could not but presume his forgiveness was at no desperate distance; but<br>
still he would not quit his posture of submission, till I had<br>
pronounced his pardon in form; which after the most fervent entreaties,<br>
protestations, and promises, I had not the power to withhold. On which,<br>
with the utmost marks of a fear of again offending, he ventured to kiss<br>
my lips, which I neither declined nor resented: but on my mild<br>
expostulation with him upon the barbarity of his treatment, he<br>
explained the mystery of my ruin, if not entirely to the clearance, at<br>
least much to the alleviation of his guilt, in the eyes of a judge so<br>
partial in his favour as I was grown.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It seems that the circumstance of his going down, or sinking, which in<br>
my extreme ignorance I had mistaken for something very fatal, was no<br>
other than a trick of diving, which I had not ever heard, or at least<br>
attended o, the mention of: and he was so long-breathed at it, that in<br>
the few moments in which I ran out to save him, he had not yet emerged,<br>
before I fell into the swoon, in which, as he rose, seeing me extended<br>
on the bank, his first idea was, that some young woman was upon some<br>
design of frolic or diversion with him, for he knew I could not have<br>
fallen asleep there without his having seen me before: agreebly to<br>
which notion he had ventured to approach, and finding me without sign<br>
of life, and still perplexed as he was what to think of the adventure,<br>
he took me in his arms at all hazards, and carried me into the<br>
summer-house, of which he observed the door open: there he laid me down<br>
on the couch, and tried, as he protested in good faith, by several<br>
means to bring me to myself again, till fired, as he said, beyond all<br>
bearing by the sight and touch of several parts of me, which were<br>
unguardedly exposed to him, he could no longer govern his passion; and<br>
the less, as he was not quite sure that his first idea of this swoon<br>
being a feint, was not the very truth of the case; seduced then by this<br>
flattering notion, and overcome by the present, as he styled them,<br>
super-human temptations, combined with the solitude and seeming<br>
security of the attempt, he was not enough his own master not to make<br>
it. Leaving me then just only whilst he fastened the door, he returned<br>
with redoubled eagerness to his prey: when, finding me still entranced,<br>
he ventured to place me as he pleased, whilst I felt, no more than the<br>
dead, what he was about, till the pain he put me to roused me just in<br>
time enough to be witness of a triumph I was not able to defeat, and<br>
now scarce regretted: for as he talked, the tone of his voice sounded,<br>
methought, so sweetly in my ears, the sensible nearness of so new and<br>
interesting an object to me, wrought so powerfully upon me, that, in<br>
the rising perception of things in a new and pleasing light, I lost all<br>
sense of the past injury. The young gentleman soon discerned the<br>
symptoms of a reconciliation in my softened looks, and hastening to<br>
receive the seal of it from my lips, pressed them tenderly to pass his<br>
pardon in the return of a kiss so melting fiery, that the impression of<br>
it being carried to my heart, and thence to my new discovered sphere of<br>
Venus, I was melted into a softness that could refuse him nothing. When<br>
now he managed his caresses and endearments so artfully, as to<br>
insinuate the most soothing consolations for the past pain and the most<br>
pleasing expectations of future pleasure, but whilst mere modesty kept<br>
my eyes from seeing his and rather declined them, I had a glimpse of<br>
that instrument of mischief which was now, obviously even to me, who<br>
had scarce had snatches of a comparative observation of it, resuming<br>
its capacity to renew it, and grew greatly alarming with its increase<br>
of size, as he bore it no doubt designedly, hard and stiff against one<br>
of my hands carelessly dropt; but then he employed such tender<br>
prefacing, such winning progressions, that my returning passion of<br>
desire being now so strongly prompted by the engaging circumstances of<br>
the sight and incendiary touch of his naked glowing beauties, I yield<br>
at length at the force of the present impressions, and he obtained of<br>
my tacit blushing consent all the gratifications of pleasure left in<br>
the power of my poor person to bestow, after he had cropt its richest<br>
flower, during my suspension of life, and abilities to guard it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here, according to the rule laid down, I should stop; but I am so much<br>
in notion, that I could not if I would. I shall only add, however, that<br>
I got home without the least discovery, or suspicion of what had<br>
happened. I met my young ravisher several times after, whom I now<br>
passionately loved and who, though not of age to claim a small but<br>
independent fortune, would have married me; but as the accident that<br>
prevented it, and its consequences, which threw me on the public,<br>
contain matters too moving and serious to introduce at present, I cut<br>
short here.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Louisa, the brunette whom I mentioned at first, now took her turn to<br>
treat the company with her history. I have already hinted to you the<br>
graces of her person, than which nothing could be more exquisitely<br>
touching; I repeat touching, as a just distinction from striking, which<br>
is ever a less lasting effect, and more generally belongs to the fair<br>
complexions; but leaving that decision to every one&rsquo;s taste, I proceed<br>
to give you Louisa&rsquo;s narrative as follows:<br>
<br>
&ldquo;According to practical maxims of life, I ought to boast of my birth,<br>
since I owe it to pure love, without marriage; but this I know, it was<br>
scarce possible to inherit a stronger propensity to that cause of my<br>
being than I did. I was the rare production of the first essay of a<br>
journeyman cabinet-maker, on his master&rsquo;s maid: the consequence of<br>
which was a big belly, and the loss of a place. He was not in<br>
circumstances to do much for her; and yet, after all this blemish, she<br>
found means, after she had dropt her burthen, and disposed of me to a<br>
poor relation in the country, to repair it by marrying a pastry-cook<br>
here in London, in thriving business; on whom she soon, under favour of<br>
the complete ascendant he had given her over him, passed me for a child<br>
she had by her first husband. I had, on that footing, been taken home,<br>
and was not six years old when this father-in-law died, and left my<br>
mother in tolerable circumstances, and without any children by him. As<br>
to my natural father, he had betaken himself to the sea; where, when<br>
the truth of things came out, I was told that he died, not immensely<br>
rich you may think, since he was no more than a common sailor. As I<br>
grew up, under the eyes of my mother, who kept on the business, I could<br>
not but see, in her severe watchfulness, the marks of a slip, which she<br>
did not care should be hereditary; but we no more choose our passions<br>
than our features or complexions, and the bent of mine was so strong to<br>
the forbidden pleasure, that it got the better, at length, of all her<br>
care and precaution. I was scarce twelve years old, before that part<br>
which she wanted so much to keep out of harm&rsquo;s way, made me feel its<br>
impatience to be taken notice of, and come into play; already had it<br>
put forth the signs of forwardness in the sprout of a soft down over<br>
it, which had often fluttered, and I might also say, grown under my<br>
constant touch and visitation, so pleased was I with what I took to be<br>
a kind of title to womanhood, that state I pined to be entered of, for<br>
the pleasures I conceived were annexed to it; and now the growing<br>
importance of that part to me, and the new sensations in it, demolished<br>
at once all my girlish play-things and amusements. Nature now pointed<br>
me strongly to more solid diversions, while all the stings of desire<br>
settled so fiercely in that little centre of them, that I could not<br>
mistake the spot I wanted a playfellow in.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I now shunned all company in which there was no hopes of coming at the<br>
object of my longings, and used to shut myself up, to indulge in<br>
solitude some tender meditation on the pleasure I strongly perceived<br>
the overture of, in feeling and examining what nature assured me must<br>
be the chosen avenue, the gates for unknown bliss to enter at, that I<br>
panted after.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But these meditations only increased my disorder, and blew the fire<br>
that consumed me. I was yet worse when, yielding at length to the<br>
insupportable irritations of the little fairy charm that tormented me,<br>
I seized it with my fingers, teazing it to no end. Sometimes, in the<br>
furious excitations of desire, I threw myself on the bed, spread my<br>
thighs abroad, and lay as it were expecting the longed-for relief, till<br>
finding my illusion, I shut and squeezed them together again, burning<br>
and fretting. In short, this develish thing, with its impetuous girds<br>
and itching fires, led me such a life, that I could neither, night or<br>
day, be at peace with it or myself. In time, however, I thought I had<br>
gained a prodigious prize, when figuring to myself that my fingers were<br>
something of the shape of what I pined for, I worked my way in with one<br>
of them with great agitation and delight; yet not without pain too did<br>
I deflower myself as far as it could reach; proceeding with such a fury<br>
of passion, in this solitary and last shift of pleasure, as extended me<br>
at length breathless on the bed in an amorous melting trance.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But frequency of use dulling the sensation, I soon began to perceive<br>
that this work was but a paultry shallow expedient, that went but a<br>
little way to relieve me, and rather raised more flame than its dry and<br>
insignificant titillation could rightly appease.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Man alone, I almost instinctively knew, as well as by what I had<br>
industriously picked up at weddings and christenings, was possessed of<br>
the only remedy that could reduce this rebellious disorder; but watched<br>
and overlooked as I was, how to come at it was the point, and that, to<br>
all appearance, an invincible one; not that I did not rack my brains<br>
and invention how at once to elude my mothers vigilance, and procure<br>
myself the satisfaction of my impetuous curiosity and longings for this<br>
mighty and untasted pleasure. At length, however, a singular chance did<br>
at once the work of a long course of alertness. One day that we had<br>
dined at an acquaintance over the way, together with a<br>
gentlewoman-lodger that occupied the first floor of our house, there<br>
started an indispensable necessity for my mother&rsquo;s going down to<br>
Greenwich to accompany her: the party was settled, when I do not know<br>
what genius whispered me to plead a headache, which I certainly had<br>
not, against my being included in a jaunt that I had not the least<br>
relish for. The pretext, however, passed, and my mother, with much<br>
reluctance, prevailed with herself to go without me; but took<br>
particular care to see me safe home, where she consigned me into the<br>
hands of an old trusty maidservants, who served in the shop, for we had<br>
not a male creature in the house.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As soon as she was gone, I told the maid I would go up and lie down on<br>
our lodger&rsquo;s bed, mine not being made, with a charge to her at the same<br>
time not to disturb me, as it was only rest I wanted. This injunction<br>
probably proved of eminent service to me. As soon as I was got into the<br>
bedchamber, I unlaced my stays, and threw myself on the outside of the<br>
bedclothes, in all the loosest undress. Here I gave myself up to the<br>
old insipid privy shifts of my self-viewing, self-touching<br>
self-enjoying, in fine, to all the means of self knowledge I could<br>
devise, in search of the pleasure that fled before me, and tantalized<br>
with that unknown something that was out of my reach; thus all only<br>
served to enflame myself, and to provoke violently my desires, whilst<br>
the one thing needful to their satisfaction was not at hand, and I<br>
could have bit my finger for representing it so ill. After then<br>
wearying and fatiguing myself with grasping shadows, whilst that most<br>
sensible part of me disdained to content itself with less than<br>
realities, the strong yearnings, the urgent struggles of nature towards<br>
the melting relief, and the extreme self-agitations I had used to come<br>
at it, had wearied and thrown me into a kind of unquiet sleep: for, if<br>
I tossed and threw about my limbs in proportion to the distraction of<br>
my dreams, as I had reason to believe I did, a bystander could not have<br>
helped seeing all for love. And one there was it seems; for waking out<br>
of my very short slumber, I found my hand locked in that of a young<br>
man, who was kneeling at my bed-side, and begging my pardon for his<br>
boldness: but that being a son to the lady to whom, this bed-chamber,<br>
he knew, belonged, he had slipped by the servant of the shop, as he<br>
supposed, unperceived, when finding me asleep, his first ideas were to<br>
withdraw; but that he had been fixed and detained there by a power he<br>
could better account for, than resist.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What shall I say? my emotions of fear and surprise were instantly<br>
subdued by those of the pleasure I bespoke in great presence of mind<br>
from the turn this adventure might take. He seemed to me no other than<br>
a pitying angel, dropt out of the clouds: for he was young and<br>
perfectly handsome, which was more than even I had asked for, man, in<br>
general, being all that my utmost desires had pointed at. I thought<br>
then I could not put too much encouragement into my eyes and voice; I<br>
regretted no leading advances; no matter for his after-opinion of my<br>
forwardness, so it might bring him to the point of answering my<br>
pressing demands of present case; it was not now with his thoughts but<br>
his actions that my business immediately lay. I raised then my head,<br>
and told him, in a soft tone, that tended to prescribe the same key to<br>
him, that his mamma was gone out and would not return till late at<br>
night: which I thought no bad hint; but as it proved, I had nothing of<br>
a novice to deal with. The impressions I had made on him from the<br>
discoveries I had betrayed of my person in the disordered motions of<br>
it, during his view of me asleep, had, as he afterwards told me, so<br>
fixed and charmingly prepared him, that, had I known his dispositions,<br>
I had more to hope from his violence, than to fear from his respect;<br>
and even less than the extreme tenderness which I threw into my voice<br>
and eyes, would have served to encourage him to make the most of the<br>
opportunity. Finding then that his kisses, imprinted on my hand, were<br>
taken as tamely as he could wish, he rose to my lips; and glewing his<br>
to them, made me so faint with overcoming joy and pleasure, that I fell<br>
back, and he with me, in course, on the bed, upon which I had, by<br>
insensibly shifting from the side to near the middle, invitingly, made<br>
room for him. He is now lain down by me, and the minutes being too<br>
precious to consume in ultimate ceremony, or dalliance, my youth<br>
proceeds immediately to those extremities, which all my looks, humming<br>
and palpitations, had assured him he might attempt without the fear of<br>
a repulse: those rogues the men, read us admirably on these occasions.<br>
I lay then at length panting for the imminent attack, with wishes far<br>
beyond my fears, and for which it was scarce possible for a girl,<br>
barely thirteen, but tall and well grown, to have better dispositions.<br>
He threw up my petticoat and shift, whilst my thighs were, by an<br>
instinct of nature, unfolded to their best; and my desires had so<br>
thoroughly destroyed all modesty in me, that even their being now naked<br>
and all laid open to him, was part of the prelude that pleasure<br>
deepened my blushes at, more than same. But when his hand, and touches,<br>
naturally attracted to their center, made me feel all their wantonness<br>
and warmth in, and round it, oh! how immensely different a sense of<br>
things, did I perceive there, than when under my own insipid handling!<br>
And now his waistcoat was unbuttoned, and the confinement of the<br>
breeches burst through, when out started to view the amazing, pleasing<br>
object of all my wishes, all my dreams, all my love, the king member<br>
indeed! I gazed at, I devoured it, at length and breadth, with my eyes<br>
intently directed to it, till his; getting upon me, and placing between<br>
my thighs, took from me the enjoyment of its sight, to give me a far<br>
more grateful one, in its touch, in that part where its touch is so<br>
exquisitely affecting. Applying it then to the minute opening, for such<br>
at that age it certainly was, I met with too much good will, I felt<br>
with too great a rapture of pleasure the first insertion of it, to heed<br>
much the pain that followed: I thought nothing too dear to pay for this<br>
the richest treat of the sense; so that, split up, torn, bleeding,<br>
mangled I was still superiorly pleased, and hugged the author of all<br>
this delicious ruin. But when, soon after, he made his second attack,<br>
sore as every thing was, the smart was soon put away by the sovereign<br>
cordial; all my soft complainings were silenced, and the pain melting<br>
fast away into pleasure. I abandoned myself over to all its transports,<br>
and gave it the full possession of my whole body and soul; for now all<br>
thought was at an end with me; I lived in what I felt only. And who<br>
could describe those feelings, those agitations, yet exalted by the<br>
charm of their novelty and surprise? when that part of me which had so<br>
hungered for the dear morsel that now so delightfully crammed, forced<br>
all my vital sensations to fix their home there, during the stay of my<br>
beloved guest; who too soon paid me for his hearty welcome, in a<br>
dissolvent, richer far than that I have heard of some queen treating<br>
her paramour with, in liquified pearl, and ravishingly poured into me,<br>
where, now myself too much melted to give it a dry reception, I hailed<br>
it with the warmest confluence on my side, amidst all those ecstatic<br>
raptures, not unfamiliar I presume to this good company. Thus, however,<br>
I arrived at the very top of all my wishes, by an accident unexpected<br>
indeed, but not so wonderful; for this young gentleman was just arrived<br>
in town from college, and came familiarly to his mother at her<br>
apartment, where he had once before been, though, by mere chance. I had<br>
not seen him: so that we knew one another by hearing only; and finding<br>
me stretched on his mother&rsquo;s bed, he readily concluded from her<br>
description, who it was. The rest you know.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This affair had however no ruinous consequences, the young gentleman<br>
escaping then, and many more times undiscovered. But the warmth of my<br>
constitution, that made the pleasures of love a kind of necessary of<br>
life to me, having betrayed me into indiscretions fatal to my private<br>
fortune, I fell at length to the public; from which, it is probable, I<br>
might have met with the worst of ruin, if my better fate had not thrown<br>
me into this safe and agreeable refuge.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Here Louisa ended; and these little histories having brought the time<br>
for the girls to retire, and to prepare for the revels of the evening,<br>
I staid with Mrs. Cole, till Emily came, and told us the company was<br>
met, and waited for us.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cole on this, taking me by the hand, with a smile of<br>
encouragement, led me up stairs, preceded by Louisa, who was come to<br>
hasten us, and lighted us with two candles, one in each hand.<br>
<br>
On the landing-place of the first pair of stairs, we were met by a<br>
young gentleman, extremely well dressed, and a very pretty figure, to<br>
whom I was to be indebted for the first essay of the pleasures of the<br>
house. He saluted me with great gallantry, and handed me into the<br>
drawing room, the floor of which was overspread with a Turkey carpet,<br>
and all its furniture voluptuously adapted to every demand of the most<br>
studied luxury; now too it was, by means of a profuse illumination,<br>
enlivened by a light scarce inferior, and perhaps more favourable to<br>
joy, more tenderly pleasing, than that of broad sunshine.<br>
<br>
On my entrance into the room, I had the satisfaction! to hear a buzz of<br>
approbation run through the whole company, which now consisted of four<br>
gentlemen, including my particular (this was the cant term of the house<br>
for one&rsquo;s gallant for the time), the three young-women, in a neat<br>
flowing dishabille, the mistress of the academy, and myself. I was<br>
welcomed and saluted by a kiss all round, in which, however, it was<br>
easy to discover, in the superior warmth of that of the men, the<br>
distinction of the sexes.<br>
<br>
Awed, and confounded as I was, at seeing myself surrounded, caressed,<br>
and made court to by so many strangers, I could not immediately<br>
familiarize myself to all that air of gaiety and joy, which dictated<br>
their compliments, and animated their caresses.<br>
<br>
They assured me that I was so perfectly to their taste, as to have but<br>
one fault against me, which I might easily be cured of, and that was my<br>
modesty: this, they observed, might pass for a beauty the more with<br>
those who wanted it for a heightener; but their maxim was, that it was<br>
an impertinent mixture, and dashed the cup so as to spoil the sincere<br>
draught of pleasure; they considered it accordingly as their mortal<br>
enemy, and gave it no quarter wherever they met with it. This was a<br>
prologue not unworthy of the revels that ensued.<br>
<br>
In the midst of all the frolic and wantonness, which this joyous band<br>
had presently, and all naturally, run into, an elegant supper was<br>
served in, and we sat down to it, my spark elect placing himself next<br>
to me, and the other couples without order or ceremony. The delicate<br>
cheer and good wine soon banished all reserve; the conversation grew as<br>
lively as could be wished, without taking too loose a turn: these<br>
professors of pleasure knew too well, how to stale impressions of it,<br>
or evaporate the imagination of words, before the time of action.<br>
Kisses however were snatched at times, or where a handkerchief round<br>
the neck interposed its feeble barrier, it was not extremely respected:<br>
the hands of the men went to work with their usual petulance, till the<br>
provocation on both sides rose to such a pitch, that my particulars&rsquo;s<br>
proposal for beginning the country dances was received with instant<br>
assent: for, as he laughingly added, he fancied the instruments were in<br>
tune. This was a signal for preparation, that the complaisant Mrs.<br>
Cole, who understood life, took for her cue of disappearing; no longer<br>
so fit for personal service herself, and content with having settled<br>
the order of battle, she left us the field, to fight it out at<br>
discretion.<br>
<br>
As soon as she was gone, the table was removed from the middle, and<br>
became a side-board; a couch was brought into its place, of which when<br>
I whisperingly inquired the reason, of my particular, he told me, &ldquo;that<br>
as it was chiefly on my account that his convention was met, the<br>
parties intended at once to humour their taste of variety in pleasures,<br>
and by an open public enjoyment, to see me broke of any taint of<br>
reserve or modesty, which they looked on as the poison of joy; that<br>
though they occasionally preached pleasure, and lived up to the text,<br>
they did not enthusiastically set up for missionaries, and only<br>
indulged themselves in the delights of a practical instruction of all<br>
the pretty women they liked well enough to bestow it upon, and who fell<br>
properly in the way of it; but that as such a proposal might be too<br>
violent, too shocking for a young beginner, the old standers were to<br>
set an example, which he hoped I would not be averse to follow, since<br>
it was to him I was devolved in favour of the first experiment; but<br>
that still I was perfectly at my liberty to refuse the party, which<br>
being in its nature one of pleasure, supposed an exclusion of all force<br>
or constraint.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
My countenance expressed, no doubt, my surprise as my silence did my<br>
acquiescence. I was now embarked, and thoroughly determined on any<br>
voyage the company would take me on.<br>
<br>
The first that stood up, to open the ball, were a cornet of horse, and<br>
that sweetest of olive-beauties, the soft and amorous Louisa. He led<br>
her to the couch (nothing loth), on which he gave her the fall, and<br>
extended her at length with an air of roughness and vigour, relishing<br>
high of amorous eagerness and impatience. The girl, spreading herself<br>
to the best advantage, with her head upon the pillow, was so<br>
concentered in that she was about, that our presence was the least of<br>
her care and concern. Her petticoats, thrown up with her shift,<br>
discovered to the company the finest turned legs and thighs that could<br>
be imagined, and in broad display, that gave us a full view of that<br>
delicious cleft of flesh, into which the pleasing hair, grown mount<br>
over it, parted and presented a most inviting entrance, between two<br>
close hedges, delicately soft and pouting. Her gallant was now ready,<br>
having disencumbered himself from his clothes, overloaded with lace,<br>
and presently, his shirt removed, shewed us his forces at high plight,<br>
bandied and ready for action. But giving us no time to consider the<br>
dimensions, he threw himself instantly over his charming antagonist who<br>
received him as he pushed at once dead at mark, like a heroine, without<br>
flinching; for surely never was girl constitutionally truer to the<br>
taste of joy, or sincerer in the expressions of its sensations, than<br>
she was: we could observe pleasure lighten in her eyes, as he<br>
introduced his plenipotentiary instrument into her; till, at length,<br>
having indulged her to its utmost reach, its irritations grew so<br>
violent, and gave her the spurs so furiously, that collected within<br>
herself, and lost to every thing but the enjoyment of her favourite<br>
feelings, she retarded his thrusts with a just concert of spring<br>
heaves, keeping time so exactly with the most pathetic sighs, that one<br>
might have numbered the strokes in agitation by their distinct murmurs,<br>
whilst her active limbs kept wreathing and intertwisting with his, in<br>
convulsive folds: then the turtle-billing kisses, and the poignant<br>
painless lovebites, which they both exchanged, in a rage of delight,<br>
all conspiring towards the melting period. It soon came on, when<br>
Louisa, in the ravings of her pleasure-frensy, impotent of all<br>
restraint, cried out: &ldquo;Oh Sir!... Good Sir! pray do not spare me! ah!<br>
ah!...&rdquo; All her accents now faultering into heart-fetched sighs, she<br>
closed her eyes in the sweet death, in the instant of which we could<br>
easily see the signs in the quiet, dying, languid posture of her late<br>
so furious driver, who was stopped of a sudden, breathing short,<br>
panting, and, for that time, giving up the spirit of pleasure. As soon<br>
as he was dismounted, Louisa sprung up, shook her petticoats, and<br>
running up to me, gave me a kiss, and drew me to the side-board, to<br>
which she was herself handed by her gallant, where they made me pledge<br>
them in a glass of wine, and toast a droll health of Louisa&rsquo;s proposal<br>
in high frolic.<br>
<br>
By this time the second couple was ready to enter the lists: which were<br>
a young baronet, and that delicatest of charmers, the winning, tender<br>
Harriet. My gentle esquire came to acquaint me with it, and brought me<br>
back to the scene of action.<br>
<br>
And, surely, never did one of her profession accompany her<br>
dispositions, for the barefaced part she was engaged to play, with such<br>
a peculiar grace of sweetness, modesty and yielding coyness, as she<br>
did. All her air and motions breathed only unreserved, unlimited<br>
complaisance without the least mixture of impudence, or prostitution.<br>
But what was yet more surprising, her spark elect, in the midst of the<br>
dissolution of a public open enjoyment, doated on her to distraction,<br>
and had, by dint of love and sentiments, touched her heart, though for<br>
a while the restraint of their engagement to the house laid him under a<br>
kind of necessity of complying with an institution which himself had<br>
had the greatest share establishing.<br>
<br>
Harriet was then led to the vacant couch by her gallant, blushing as<br>
she looked at me, and with eyes made to justify any thing, tenderly<br>
bespeaking of me the most favourable construction of the step she was<br>
thus irresistibly drawn into.<br>
<br>
Her lover, for such he was, sat her down at the foot of the couch, and<br>
passing his arm round her neck, preluded with a kiss fervently applied<br>
to her lips, that visibly gave her life and spirit to go through with<br>
the scene; and as he kissed, he gently inclined her head, till it fell<br>
back on a pillow disposed to receive it, and leaning himself down all<br>
the way with her, at once countenanced and endeared her fall to her.<br>
There, as if he had guessed our wishes, or meant to gratify at once his<br>
pleasure and his pride, in being the master, by the title of present<br>
possession, of beauties delicate beyond imagination, he discovered her<br>
breast to his own touch, and our common view; but oh! what delicious<br>
manual of love devotion; how inimitable fine moulded! small, round,<br>
firm, and excellently white; then the grain of their skin, so soothing,<br>
so flattering to the touch! and of beauty. When he had feasted his eyes<br>
with the their nipples, that crowned them, the sweetest buds touch and<br>
perusal, feasted his lips with kisses of the highest relish, imprinted<br>
on those all delicious twin-orbs, he proceeded downwards.<br>
<br>
Her legs still kept the ground; and now, with the tenderest attention<br>
not to shock or alarm her too suddenly, he, by degrees, rather stole<br>
than rolled up her petticoats; at which, as if a signal had been given,<br>
Louisa and Emily took hold of her legs, in pure wantonness, and, in<br>
ease to her, kept them stretched wide abroad. Then lay exposed, or, to<br>
speak more properly, displayed the greatest parade in nature of female<br>
charms. The whole company, who, except myself, had often seen them,<br>
seemed as much dazzled, surprised and delighted, as any one could be<br>
who had now beheld them for the first time. Beauties so excessive could<br>
not but enjoy the privileges of eternal novelty. Her thighs were so<br>
exquisitely fashioned, that either more in, or more out of flesh than<br>
they were, they would have declined from that point of perfection they<br>
presented. But what infinitely enriched and adorned them, was the sweet<br>
intersection formed, where they met, at the bottom of the smoothest,<br>
roundest, whitest belly, by that central furrow which nature had sunk<br>
there, between the soft relievo of two pouting ridges, and which, in<br>
this girl, was in perfect symmetry of delicacy and miniature with the<br>
rest of her frame. No! nothing in nature could be of a beautifuller<br>
cut; then, the dark umbrage of the downy spring moss that over-arched<br>
it, bestowed, on the luxury of the landscape, a touching warmth, a<br>
tender finishing, beyond the expression of words, or even the paint of<br>
thought.<br>
<br>
Her truly enamoured gallant, who had stood absorbed and engrossed by<br>
the pleasure of the sight long enough to afford us time to feast ours<br>
(no fear of glutting!) addressed himself at length to the materials of<br>
enjoyment, and lifting the linen veil that hung between us and his<br>
master member of the revels, exhibited one whose eminent size<br>
proclaimed the owner a true woman&rsquo;s hero. He was, besides in every<br>
other respect, an accomplished gentleman, and in the bloom and vigour<br>
of youth. Standing then between Harriet&rsquo;s legs, which were supported by<br>
her two companions at their widest extension, with one hand he gently<br>
disclosed the lips of that luscious mouth of nature, whilst with the<br>
other, he stooped his mighty machine to its lure, from the height of<br>
his stiff stand-up towards his belly; the lips, kept open by his<br>
fingers, received its broad shelving head of coral hue: and when he had<br>
nestled it in, he hovered there a little, and the girls then delivered<br>
over to his hips the agreeable office of supporting her thighs; and<br>
now, as if he meant to spin out his pleasure, and give it the more play<br>
for its life, he passed up his instrument so slow that we lost sight of<br>
it inch by inch, till at length it was wholly taken into the soft<br>
laboratory of love, and the mossy mounts of each fairly met together.<br>
In the mean time, we could plainly mark the prodigious effect the<br>
progressions of this delightful energy wrought in this delicious girl,<br>
gradually heightening her beauty as they heightened her pleasure. Her<br>
countenance and whole frame grew more animated; the faint blush of her<br>
cheeks, gaining ground on the white, deepened into a florid vivid<br>
vermillion glow, her naturally brilliant eyes now sparkled with<br>
ten-fold lustre; her languor was vanished, and she appeared quick,<br>
spirited and alive all over. He had now fixed, nailed, this tender<br>
creature, with his home-driven wedge, so that she lay passive by force,<br>
and unable to stir, till beginning to play a strain of arms against<br>
this vein of delicacy, as he urged the to-and-fro con-friction, he<br>
awakened, roused, and touched her so to the heart, that unable to<br>
contain herself, she could not but reply to his motions, as briskly as<br>
her nicety of frame would admit of, till the raging stings of the<br>
pleasure rising towards the point, made her wild with the intolerable<br>
sensations of it, and she now threw her legs and arms about at random,<br>
as she lay lost in the sweet transport; which on his side declared<br>
itself by quicker, eager thrusts, convulsive gasps, burning sighs,<br>
swift laborious breathing, eyes darting humid fires: all faithful<br>
tokens of the imminent approaches of the last gasp of joy. It came on<br>
at length: the baronet led the extasy, which she critically joined in,<br>
as she felt the melting symptoms from him, in the nick of which, gluing<br>
more ardently than ever his lips to hers, he shewed all the signs of<br>
that agony of bliss being strong upon him, in which he gave her the<br>
finishing titillation; inly thrilled with which, we saw plainly that<br>
she answered it down with all effusion of spirit and matter she was<br>
mistress of, whilst a general soft shudder ran through all her limbs,<br>
which she gave a stretch out, and lay motionless, breathless, dying<br>
with dear delight; and in the height of its expression, showing,<br>
through the nearly closed lids of her eyes, just the edges of their<br>
black, the rest being rolled strongly upwards in their extasy; then her<br>
sweet mouth appeared languishingly open, with the tip of her tongue<br>
leaning negligently towards the lower range of her white teeth, whilst<br>
natural ruby colour of her lips glowed with heightened life. Was not<br>
this a subject to dwell upon? And accordingly her lover still kept on<br>
her, with an abiding delectation, till compressed, squeezed and<br>
distilled to the last drop, he took leave with one fervent kiss,<br>
expressing satisfied desires, but unextinguished love.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was off, I ran to her, and sitting down on the couch by<br>
her, rais&rsquo;d her head, which she declined gently, and hung on my bosom,<br>
to hide her blushes and confusion at what had passed, till by degrees<br>
she re-composed herself, and accepted of a restorative glass of wine<br>
from my spark, who had left me to fetch it to her, whilst her own was<br>
readjusting his affaire and buttoning up; after which he led her,<br>
leaning languishingly upon him, to oar stand of view round the couch.<br>
<br>
And now Emily&rsquo;s partner had taken her out for her share in the dance,<br>
when this transcendently fair and sweet tempered creature readily stood<br>
up; and if a complexion to put the rose and lily out of countenance,<br>
extreme pretty features, and that florid health and bloom for which the<br>
country girls are so lovely, might pass her for a beauty, this she<br>
certainly was, and one of the most striking of the fair ones.<br>
<br>
Her gallant began first, as she stood, to disengage, her breasts, and<br>
restore them to the liberty of nature, from the easy confinement of no<br>
more than a pair of jumps; but on their coming out to view, we thought<br>
a new light was added to the room, so superiourly shining was their<br>
whiteness; then they rose in so happy a swell as to compose her a well<br>
horned fullness of bosom, that had such an effect on the eye as to seem<br>
flash hardened into marble, of which it emulated the polished gloss,<br>
and far surpassed even the whitest, in the life and lustre of its<br>
colours, white weined with blue. Who could refrain from such provoking<br>
enticements in reach? he touched her breasts, first lightly, when the<br>
glossy smoothness of the skin eluded his hand, and made it slip along<br>
the surface; he pressed them, and the springy flesh that filled them,<br>
thus pitted by force, rose again reboundingly with his hand, and on the<br>
instant defaced the pressure: and alike indeed was the consistence of<br>
all those parts of her body throughout, where the fulness of flesh<br>
compacts and constitutes all that fine firmness which the touch is so<br>
highly attached to. When he had thus largely pleased himself with this<br>
branch of dalliance and delight, he trussed up her petticoat and shift,<br>
in a wisp to her waist, where being tucked in, she stood fairly naked<br>
on every side; a blush at this overspread her lovely face, and her eyes<br>
downcast to the ground, seemed to be for quarter, when she had so great<br>
a right to triumph in all the treasures of youth and beauty that she<br>
now so victoriously displayed. Her legs were perfectly well shaped and<br>
her thighs, which she kept pretty close, shewed so white, so round, so<br>
substantial and abounding in firm flesh, that nothing could afford a<br>
stronger recommendation to the luxury of the touch, which he<br>
accordingly did not fail to indulge in. Then gently removing her hand,<br>
which in the first emotion of natural modesty, she had carried thither,<br>
he gave us rather a glimpse than a view of that soft narrow chink<br>
running its little length downwards, and hiding the remains of it<br>
between her thighs; but plain was to be seen the fringe of light-brown<br>
curls, in beauteous growth over it, that with their silk gloss created<br>
a pleasing variety from the surrounding white, whose lustre too, their<br>
gentle embrowning shade, considerably raised. Her spark then<br>
endeavoured, as she stood, by disclosing her thighs, to gain us a<br>
completer sight of that central charm of attraction, but not obtaining<br>
it so conveniently in that attitude, he led her to the foot of the<br>
couch, and bringing it to one of the pillows gently inclined her head<br>
down, so that as she leaned with it over her crossed hands, straddling<br>
with her thighs wide spread, and jutting her body out, she presented a<br>
full back view of her person, naked to her waist. Her posteriors,<br>
plump, smooth, and prominent, formed luxuriant tracts of animated snow,<br>
that splendidly filled the eye, till it was commanded down the parting<br>
or separation of those exquisitely white cliffs, by their narrow vale,<br>
and was there stopt, and attracted by the embowered bottom-savity, that<br>
terminated this delightful vista and stood moderately gaping from the<br>
influence of her bended posture, so that the agreeable interior red of<br>
the sides of the orifice came into view, and with respect to the white<br>
that dazzled round it, gave somewhat the idea of a pink slash in the<br>
glossiest white satin. Her gallant, who was a gentleman about thirty,<br>
somewhat inclined to a fatness that was in no sort displeasing,<br>
improving the hint thus tendered him of this mode of enjoyment, after<br>
setting her well in this posture, and encouraging her with kisses and<br>
caresses to stand him thro&rsquo;, drew out his affair ready erected, and<br>
whose extreme length, rather disproportioned to its breadth, was the<br>
more surprising, as that excess is not often the case with those of his<br>
corpulent habit; making then the right and direct application, he drove<br>
it up to the guard, whilst the round bulge of those Turkish beauties of<br>
her&rsquo;s, tallying with the hollow made with the bent of his belly and<br>
thighs, as he curved inwards, brought all those parts, surely not<br>
un-delightfully, into warm touch, and close conjunction; his hands he<br>
kept passing round her body, and employed in toying with her enchanting<br>
breasts. As soon too as she felt him at home as he could reach, she<br>
lifted her head a little from the pillow, and turning her neck, without<br>
much straining, but her cheeks glowing with the deepest scarlet, and a<br>
smile of the tenderest satisfaction, met the kiss he pressed forward to<br>
give her as they were thus close joined together: when leaving him to<br>
pursue his delights, she hid again her face and blushes with her hands<br>
and pillow, and thus stood passively and as favourably too as she<br>
could, whilst he kept laying at her with repeated thrusts and making<br>
the meeting flesh on both sides resound again with the violence of<br>
them; then ever as he backened from her, we could see between them part<br>
of his long white staff foamingly in motion, till, as he went on again<br>
and closed with her, the interposing hillocks took it out of sight.<br>
Sometimes he took his hands from the semi-globes of her bosom, and<br>
transferred the pressure of them to those large ones, the present<br>
subjects of his soft blockade, which he squeezed, grasped and played<br>
with, till at length in pursuit of driving, so hotly urged, brought on<br>
the height of the fit, with such overpowering pleasure, that his fair<br>
partner became now necessary to support him, panting, fainting and<br>
dying as he discharged; which she no sooner felt the killing sweetness<br>
of, than unable to keep her legs, and yielding to the mighty<br>
intoxication, she reeld, and falling forward on the couch, made it a<br>
necessity for him, if he would preserve the warm-pleasure hold, to fall<br>
upon her, where they perfected, in a continued conjunction of body and<br>
ecstatic flow, their scheme of joys for that time.<br>
<br>
As soon as he had disengaged, the charming Emily got up, and we crowded<br>
round her with congratulations and other officious little services; for<br>
it is to be noted, that though all modesty and reserve were banished<br>
from the transaction of these pleasures, good manners and politeness<br>
were inviolably observed: there was no gross ribaldry, no offensive or<br>
rude behaviour, or ungenerous reproaches to the girls for their<br>
compliance with the humours and desires of the men. On the contrary,<br>
nothing was wanting to soothe, encourage, and soften the sense of their<br>
condition to them. Men know not in general how much they destroy of<br>
their own pleasure, when they break through the respect and tenderness<br>
due to our sex, and even to those of it who live only by pleasing them.<br>
And this was a maxim perfectly well understood by these polite<br>
voluptuaries, these profound adepts in the great art and science of<br>
pleasure, who never shewed these votaries of theirs a more tender<br>
respect than at the time of those exercises of their complaisance, when<br>
they unlocked their treasures of concealed beauty, and shewed out in<br>
the pride of their native charms, ever more touching surely than when<br>
they parade it in the artificial ones of dress and ornament.<br>
<br>
The frolic was now come round to me, and it being my turn of<br>
subscription to the will and pleasure of my particular elect, as well<br>
as to that of the company, he came to me, and saluting me very<br>
tenderly, with a flattering eagerness, put me in mind of the<br>
compliances my presence there authorized the hopes of, and at the same<br>
time repeated to me, &ldquo;that if all this force of example had not<br>
surmounted any repugnance I might have to concur with the humours and<br>
desires of the company, that though the play was bespoke for my<br>
benefit, and great as his own private disappointment might be, he would<br>
suffer any thing, sooner than be the instrument of imposing a<br>
disagreeable task.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
To this I answered, without the least hesitation, or mincing grimace,<br>
&ldquo;that had I not even contracted a kind of engagement to be at his<br>
disposal without the least reserve, the example of such agreeable<br>
companions would alone determine me, and that I was in no pain about<br>
any thing but my appearing to so great a disadvantage after such<br>
superior beauties.&rdquo; And take notice that I thought, as I spoke. The<br>
frankness of the answer pleased them all; my particular was<br>
complimented on his acquisition, and, by way of indirect flattery to<br>
me, openly envied me.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cole, by the way, could not have given me a greater mark of her<br>
regard than in managing for me the choice of this young gentleman for<br>
my master of the ceremonies: for, independent of his noble birth and<br>
the great fortune he was heir to, his person was even uncommonly<br>
pleasing, well shaped and tall; his face marked with the small-pox, but<br>
no more than what added a grace of more manliness to features rather<br>
turned to softness and delicacy, was marvellously enlivened by eyes<br>
which were of the clearest sparkling black; in short he was one whom<br>
any woman would, in the familiar style, ready call a very pretty<br>
fellow.<br>
<br>
I was now handed by him to the cockpit of our match, where, as I was<br>
dressed in nothing but a white morning gown, he vouchsafed to play the<br>
male Abigail on this occasion, and spared me the confusion that would<br>
have attended the forwardness of undressing myself: my gown then was<br>
loosen&rsquo;d in a trice, and I divested of it; my stays next offered an<br>
obstacle which readily gave way, Louisa very readily furnished a pair<br>
of scissors to cut the lace; off went that shell and dropping my<br>
uppercoat, I was reduced to my under one and my shift, the open bosom<br>
of which gave the hands and eyes all the liberty they could wish. Here<br>
I imagined the stripping was to stop, but I reckon short; my spark, at<br>
the desire of the rest, tenderly begged, that I would not suffer the<br>
small remains of a covering to rob them of a full view of my whole<br>
person; and for me, who was too flexibly obsequious to dispute any<br>
point with them, and who considered the little more that remained as<br>
very immaterial, I readily assented to whatever he pleased-In an<br>
instant, then, my under petticoat was untied and at my feet, and my<br>
shift drawn over my head, so that my cap, slightly fastened, came off<br>
with it, and brought all my hair down (of which, be it again remembered<br>
without vanity, that I had a very fine head) in loose disorderly<br>
ringlets, over my neck and shoulders, to the no unfavourable set-off of<br>
my skin.<br>
<br>
I now stood before my judges in all the truth of nature, to whom I<br>
could not appear a very disagreeable figure, if you please to recollect<br>
what I have beforesaid of my person, which time, that at certain<br>
periods of life robs use every instant of our charms, had, at that of<br>
mine, then greatly improved into full and open, bloom, for I wanted<br>
some months of eighteen. My breasts, which in the state of nudity are<br>
ever capital points, now in no more than in graceful plenitude,<br>
maintained a firmness and steady independence of any stay or support,<br>
that dared and invited the test of the touch. Then I was as tall, as<br>
slim-shaped as could be consistent with all that juicy plumpness of<br>
flesh, ever the most grateful to the senses of sight and touch, which I<br>
owed to the health and youth of my constitution. I had not, however, so<br>
thoroughly renounced all innate shame, as not to suffer great confusion<br>
at the state I saw myself in; but the whole troop round me, men and<br>
women, relieved me with every mark of applause and satisfaction, even<br>
flattering attention to raise and inspire me with even sentiments of<br>
pride on the figure I made, which my friend gallantly protested,<br>
infinitely outshone all other birthday finery whatever; so that had I<br>
leave to set down, for sincere, all the compliments these connoisseurs<br>
overwhelmed me with upon this occasion, I might flatter myself with<br>
having passed my examination with the approbation of the learned.<br>
<br>
My friend, however, who for this time had alone the disposal of me,<br>
humoured their curiosity, and perhaps his own, so far, that he placed<br>
me in all the variety of postures and lights imaginable, pointing out<br>
every beauty under every aspect of it, not without such parentheses, of<br>
kisses, such inflammatory liberties of his roving hands, as made all<br>
shame fly before them, and a blushing glow give place to a warmer one<br>
of desire, which led me even to find some relish in the present scene.<br>
<br>
But in this general survey, you may be sure, the most material spot of<br>
me was not excused the strictest visitation; nor was it but agreed,<br>
that I had not the least reason to be diffident of passing even for a<br>
maid, on occasion; so inconsiderable a flaw had my preceding adventures<br>
created there, and so soon had the blemish of an over-stretch been<br>
repaired and worn out at any age, and in my naturally small make in<br>
that part.<br>
<br>
Now, whether my partner had exhausted all the modes of regaling the<br>
touch or sight, or whether he was now ungovernably wound up to strike,<br>
I know not; but briskly throwing off his clothes, the prodigious heat<br>
bred by a close room, a great fire, numerous candles, and even the<br>
inflammatory warmth of these scenes, induced him to lay aside his shirt<br>
too, when his breeches, before loosened, now gave up their contents to<br>
view, and shew&rsquo;d in front the enemy I had to engage with, stiffly<br>
bearing up the port of its head unhooded, and glowing red. Then I<br>
plainly saw what I had to trust to: it was one of those just true-sized<br>
instruments, of which the masters have a better command than the more<br>
unwieldy, inordinate sized one are generally under. Straining me then<br>
close to his bosom, as he stood up foreright against me, and applying<br>
to the obvious niche its peculiar idol, he aimed at inserting it,<br>
which, as I forwardly favoured, he effected at once, by canting up my<br>
thighs over his naked hips, and made me receive every inch, and close<br>
home; so-that stuck upon the pleasure-pivot, add clinging round his<br>
neck, in which and in his hair I hid my face, burn-ingly flushing with<br>
present feeling as much as with shame, my bosom glued to him; he<br>
carried me once round the couch, on which he then, without quitting the<br>
middle-fastness, or dischannelling, laid me down, and began with<br>
pleasure-grist. But so provokingly predisposed and primed as we were,<br>
by all the moving sights of the night, our imagination was too much<br>
heated not to melt us of the soonest; and accordingly I no sooner felt<br>
the warm spray darted up my inwards from him, but I was punctually on<br>
flow, to share the momentary extasy; but I had yet greater reason to<br>
boast of our harmony: for finding that all the flames of desire were<br>
not yet quenched within me, but that rather, like wetted coals, I<br>
glowed the fiercer for this sprinkling, my hot-mettled spark,<br>
sympathizing with me, and loaded for a double fire, recontinued the<br>
sweet battery with undying vigour; greatly encouraged to accommodate<br>
all my motions to his best advantage and delight; kisses, squeezes,<br>
tender murmurs, all came into play, till our joys growing more<br>
turbulent and riotous, threw us into a fond disorder, and as they raged<br>
to a point, bore us far from our selves into an ocean of boundless<br>
pleasures, into which we both plunged together in a transport of taste.<br>
Now all the impressions of burning desire, from the lively scenes I had<br>
been spectatress of, ripened the heat of this exercise, and collecting<br>
to a head, throbbed and agitated me with insupportable irritations: I<br>
perfectly fevered and maddened with their excess. I bid not now enjoy a<br>
calm of reason enough to perceive, but I ecstatically, indeed, felt the<br>
power of such rare and exquisite provocatives, as the examples of the<br>
night had proved towards thus exalting our pleasures: which, with great<br>
joy, I sensibly found my gallant shared in, by his nervous and home<br>
expressions of it: his eyes flashing eloquent flames, his action<br>
infuriated with the stings of it, all conspiring to raise my delight,<br>
by assuring me of his. Lifted then to the utmost pitch of joy that<br>
human life can bear, undestroyed by excess, I touched that sweetly<br>
critical point, whence scarce prevented by the injection from my<br>
partner, I dissolved, and breaking out into a deep drawn sigh, sent my<br>
whole sensitive soul down to that passage where escape was denied it,<br>
by its being so deliciously plugged and choked up. Thus we lay a few<br>
blissful instants, overpowered, still, and languid; till, as the sense<br>
of pleasure stagnated, we recovered from our trance, and he slipt out<br>
of me, not however before he had protested his extreme satisfaction by<br>
the tenderest kiss and embrace, as well as by the most cordial<br>
expressions.<br>
<br>
The company, who had stood round us in a profound silence, when all was<br>
over, helped me to hurry on my clothes in an instant, and complimented<br>
me on the sincere homage they could not escape observing had been done<br>
as they termed it&mdash;to the sovereignty of my charms, in my receiving a<br>
double payment of tribute at one juncture. But my partner, now dressed<br>
again, signalized, above all, a fondness unbated by the circumstance of<br>
recent enjoyment; the girls too kissed and embraced me, assuring me<br>
that for that time, or indeed any other, unless I pleased, I was to go<br>
through no farther public trials, and that I was now consummatedly<br>
initiated, and one of them.<br>
<br>
As it was an inviolable law for every gallant to keep to his partner,<br>
for the night especially, and even till he relinquished possession over<br>
to the community, in order to preserve a pleasing property, and to<br>
avoid the disgusts and indelicacy of another arrangement, the company,<br>
after a short refection of biscuits and wine, tea and chocolate, served<br>
in at now about one in the morning, broke up, and went off in pairs.<br>
Mrs. Cole had prepared my spark and me an occasion field-bed, to which<br>
we retired, and there ended the night in one continued strain of<br>
pleasure, sprightly and uncloyed enough for us not to have formed one<br>
wish for its ever knowing an end. In the morning, after a restorative<br>
breakfast in bed, he got up, and with very tender assurance of a<br>
particular regard for me, left me to the composure and refreshment of a<br>
sweet slumber; waking out of which, and getting up to dress before Mrs.<br>
Cole should come in, I found in one of my pockets a purse of guineas,<br>
which he had slipt there; and just as I was musing on a liberality I<br>
had certainly not expected, Mrs. Cole came in, to whom I immediately<br>
communicated the present, and naturally offered her whatever share she<br>
pleased: but assuring me that the gentleman had very nobly rewarded<br>
her, she would on no terms, no entreaties, no shape I could put it in,<br>
receive any part of it. Her denial, she observed, was no affectation of<br>
grimace, and proceeded to read me such admirable lessons on the economy<br>
of my person and my purse, as I became amply paid for my general<br>
attention and conformity to in the course of my acquaintance with the<br>
town. After which, changing the discourse, she fell on the pleasures of<br>
the preceding night, where I learned, without much surprise, as I began<br>
to enter on her character, that she had seen every thing that had<br>
passed, from a convenient place managed solely for that purpose, and of<br>
which she readily made me the confidante.<br>
<br>
She had scarce finished this, when the little troop of love girls, my<br>
companions, broke in, and renewed their compliments and caresses. I<br>
observed with pleasure, that the fatigues and exercises of the night<br>
had not usurped in the least on the life of their complexion, or the<br>
freshness of their bloom: this I found, by their confession, was owing<br>
to the management and advice of our rare directress. They went down<br>
then to figure it, as usual, in the shop; whilst I repaired to my<br>
lodging, where I employed myself till I returned to dinner at Mrs.<br>
Cole&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
Here I staid in constant amusement, with one or other of these charming<br>
girls, till about five in the evening; when seized with a sudden drowsy<br>
fit, I was prevailed on to go up and doze it off on Harriet&rsquo;s bed, who<br>
left me on it to my repose. There then I laid down in my clothes, and<br>
fell fast asleep, and had now enjoyed, by guess, about an hour&rsquo;s rest,<br>
when I was pleasingly disturbed by my new and favourite gallant, who,<br>
enquiring for me, was readily directed where to find me. Coming then<br>
into my chamber, and seeing me lie alone, with my face turned from the<br>
light towards the inside of the bed, he, without more ado, just slipped<br>
off his breeches, for the greater ease and enjoyment of the naked<br>
touch; and softly turning up my petticoats and shift behind, opened the<br>
prospect of the back avenue to the genial seat of pleasure; where, as I<br>
lay at my side length, inclining rather face downward, I appeared full<br>
fair, and liable to be entered. Laying himself gently down by me, he<br>
invested me behind, and giving me to feel the warmth of his body, as he<br>
applied his thighs and belly close to me, and the endeavours of that<br>
machine, whose touch has something so exquisitely singular in it, to<br>
make its way good into me. I awaked pretty much startled at first, at<br>
seeing who it was, disposed myself to turn to him, when he gave me a<br>
kiss, and desiring me to keep my posture, just lifted up my upper<br>
thigh, and ascertaining the right opening, soon drove it up to the<br>
farthest: satisfied with which, and solacing himself with lying so<br>
close in those parts, he suspended motion, and thus steeped in<br>
pleasure, kept me lying on my side, into him, spoon-fashion, as he<br>
termed it, from the snug indent of the back part of my thighs, and all<br>
upwards, into the space of the bending between his thighs and belly;<br>
till, after some time, that restless and turbulent inmate, impatient by<br>
nature of longer quiet, urged him to action, which now prosecuting with<br>
all the usual train of toying, kissing, and the like, ended at length<br>
in the liquid proof on both sides, that we had not exhausted, or at<br>
less were quickly recruited of last night&rsquo;s draughts of pleasure in us.<br>
<br>
With this noble and agreeable youth lived I in perfect joy and<br>
constancy. He was full bent on keeping me to himself, for the<br>
honey-month at least; but his stay in London was not even so long, his<br>
father, who had a post in Ireland, taking him abruptly with him, on his<br>
repairing thither. Yet even then I was near keeping hold of his<br>
affection and person, as he had proposed, and I had consented to follow<br>
him in order to go to Ireland after him, as soon as he could be settled<br>
there; but meeting with an agreeable and advantageous match in that<br>
kingdom, he chose the wiser part, and forebore sending for me, but at<br>
the same time took care that I should receive a very magnificent<br>
present, which did not however compensate for all my deep regret on my<br>
loss of him.<br>
<br>
This event also created a chasm in our little society, which Mrs. Cole,<br>
on the foot of her usual caution, was in no haste to fill up; but then<br>
it redoubled her attention to procure me, in the advantages of a<br>
traffic for a counterfeit maidenhead, some consolation for the sort of<br>
widowhood I had been left in; and this was a scheme she had never lost<br>
prospect of, and only waited for a proper person to bring it to bear<br>
with.<br>
<br>
But I was, it seems, fated to be my own caterer in this, as I had been<br>
in my first trial of the market.<br>
<br>
I had now passed near a month in the enjoyment of all the pleasures of<br>
familiarity and society with my companions, whose particular favourites<br>
(the baronet excepted, who soon after took Harriet home) had all, on<br>
the terms of community established in the house, solicited the<br>
gratification of their taste for variety in my embraces; but I had with<br>
the utmost art and address, on various pretexts, eluded their pursuit,<br>
without giving them cause to complain; and this reserve I used neither<br>
out of dislike of them, nor disgust of the thing, but my true reason<br>
was my attachment to my own, and my tenderness of invading the choice<br>
of my companions, who outwardly exempt, as they seemed, from jealousy,<br>
could not but in secret like me the better for the regard I had for,<br>
without making a merit of it to them. Thus easy, and beloved by the<br>
whole family, did I get on; when one day, that, about five in the<br>
afternoon, I stepped over to a fruit shop in Covent Garden, to pick<br>
some table fruit for myself and the young women, I met with the<br>
following adventure.<br>
<br>
Whilst I was chaffering for the fruit I wanted, I observed myself<br>
followed by a young gentleman, whose rich dress first attracted my<br>
notice; for the rest, he had nothing remarkable in his person, except<br>
that he was pale, thin-made, and ventured himself upon legs rather of<br>
the slenderest. Easy was it to perceive, without seeming to perceive<br>
it, that it was me he wanted to be at; and keeping his eyes fixed on<br>
me, till he came to the same basket that I stood at, and cheapening, or<br>
rather giving the first price asked for the fruit, began his<br>
approaches. Now most certainly I was not at all out of figure to pass<br>
for a modest girl. I had neither the feathers, nor fumet of a taudry<br>
town-miss: a straw hat, a white gown, clean linen, and above all, a<br>
certain natural and easy air of modesty (which the appearances of never<br>
forsook me, even on those occasions that I most broke in upon it, in<br>
practice) were all signs that gave him no opening to conjecture my<br>
condition. He spoke to me; and this address from a stranger throwing a<br>
blush into my cheeks, that still set him wider of the truth, I answered<br>
him, with an awkwardness and confusion the more apt to impose, as there<br>
really was a mixture of the genuine in them. But when proceeding, on<br>
the foot of having broken the ice, to join discourse, he went into<br>
other leading questions, I put so much innocence, simplicity, and even<br>
childishness, into my answers, that on no better foundation, liking my<br>
person as he did, I will not answer for it, he would have been sworn<br>
for my modesty. There is, in short, in the men, when once they are<br>
caught, by the eye especially, a fund of cullibility that their lordly<br>
wisdom little dreams of, and in virtue of which the most sagacious of<br>
them are seen so often our dupes. Amongst other queries he put to me,<br>
one was, whether I was married? I replied, that I was too young to<br>
think of that this many a year. To that of my age, I answered, and sunk<br>
a year upon him, passing myself for not above seventeen. As to my way<br>
of life, I told him I had served an apprenticeship to a milliner in<br>
Preston, and was come to town after a relation, that I had found, on my<br>
arrival, was dead, and now lived journey-woman to a milliner in town.<br>
That last article, indeed, was not much of the side of what I pretended<br>
to pass for; but it did pass, under favour of the growing passion I had<br>
inspired him with. After he had next got out of me, very dexterously as<br>
he thought, what I had no sort of design to make reserve of, my own, my<br>
mistress&rsquo;s name, and place of abode, he loaded me with fruit, all the<br>
rarest and dearest he could pick out and sent me home, pondering on<br>
what might be the consequence of this adventure.<br>
<br>
As soon then as I came to Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s, I related to her all that<br>
passed, on which she very judiciously concluded, that if he did not<br>
come after me there was no harm done, and that, if he did, as her<br>
presage suggested to her he would, his character and his views should<br>
be well sifted, so as to know whether the game was worth the springes;<br>
that in the mean time nothing was easier than my part in it, since no<br>
more rested on me than to follow her cue and promptership throughout,<br>
till the last act.<br>
<br>
The next morning, after an evening spent on his side, as we afterwards<br>
learnt, in perquisitions into Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s character in the<br>
neighbourhood (than which nothing could be more favourable to her<br>
designs upon him), my gentleman came in his chariot to the shop, where<br>
Mrs. Cole alone had an inkling of his errand. Asking then for her, he<br>
easily made a beginning of acquaintance by bespeaking some millinery<br>
ware; when, as I sat without lifting my eyes, and pursuing the hem of a<br>
ruffle with the utmost composure and simplicity of industry, Mrs. Cole<br>
took notice, that the first impressions I made on him ran no risk of<br>
being destroyed by those of Louisa and Emily, who were then sitting at<br>
work by me. After vainly endeavouring to catch my eyes in rencounter<br>
with him (I held my head down, affecting a kind of consciousness of<br>
guilt for having, by speaking to him given him encouragement and means<br>
of following me), and after giving Mrs. Cole direction when to bring<br>
the things home herself, and the time he should expect them, he went<br>
out, taking with him some goods, that he paid for liberally, for the<br>
better grace of his introduction.<br>
<br>
The girls all this time did not in the least smoak the mystery of this<br>
new customer; but Mrs. Cole, as soon as we were conveniently alone,<br>
insured me, in virtue of her long experience in these matters, &ldquo;that<br>
for this bout my charms had not missed fire; for by his eagerness, his<br>
manner and looks, she was sure he had it: the only point now in doubt<br>
was his character and circumstances, which her knowledge of the town<br>
would soon gain her the sufficient acquaintance with, to take measure<br>
upon.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
And effectively, in a few hours, her intelligence served her so well,<br>
that she learned that this conquest of mine was no other than Mr.<br>
Norbert, a gentleman originally of great fortune, which, with a<br>
constitution naturally not the best, he had vastly impaired by his<br>
over-violent pursuit of the vices of the town; in the course of which,<br>
having worn out and staled all the more common modes of debauchery, he<br>
had fallen into a taste of maiden-hunting; in which chase he had ruined<br>
a number of girls, sparing no expense to compass his ends, and<br>
generally using them well till tired, or cooled by enjoying, or<br>
springing a new face, he could with more ease disembarrass himself of<br>
the old ones, and resign them to their fate, as his sphere of<br>
achievements of that sort lay only amongst such as he could proceed<br>
with by way of bargain and sale.<br>
<br>
Concluding from these premises, Mrs. Cole observed, that a character of<br>
this sort was ever a lawful prize; that the sin would be, not to make<br>
the best of our market of him; and that she thought such a girl as I<br>
only too good for him at any rate, and on any terms.<br>
<br>
She went then, at the hour appointed, to his lodgings in one of our<br>
inns of court, which were furnished in a taste of grandeur that had a<br>
special eye to all the conveniences of luxury and pleasure. Here she<br>
found him in ready waiting; and after finishing her business of<br>
pretence, and a long conduit of discussions concerning her trade, which<br>
she said was very bad, the qualities of her servants, apprentices,<br>
journey-women, the discourse naturally landed at length on me, when<br>
Mrs. Cole, acting admirably the good old prating gossip, who lets every<br>
thing escape her when her tongue is set in motion, cooked him up a<br>
story so plausible of me, throwing in every now and then such strokes<br>
of art, with all the simplest air of nature, in praise of my person and<br>
temper, as finished him finely for her purpose, whilst nothing could be<br>
better counterfeited than her innocence of his. But when now fired and<br>
on edge, he proceeded to drop hints of his design and views upon me,<br>
after he had with much confusion and pains brought her to the point<br>
(she kept as long aloof from it as she thought proper) of understanding<br>
him, without now affecting to pass for a dragoness of virtue, by flying<br>
out into those violent and ever suspicious passions, she stuck with the<br>
better grace and effect to the character of a plain, good sort of<br>
woman, that knew no harm, and that getting her bread in an honest way,<br>
was made of stuff easy and flexible enough to be wrought to his ends,<br>
by his superior skill and address; but, however, she managed so<br>
artfully that three or four meetings took place, before he could obtain<br>
the least favourable hope of her assistance; without which, he had, by<br>
a number of fruitless messages, letters, and other direct trials of my<br>
disposition, convinced himself there was no coming at me, all which too<br>
raised at once my character and price with him.<br>
<br>
Regardful, however, of not carrying these difficulties to such a length<br>
as might afford time for starting discoveries, or incidents,<br>
unfavourable to her plan, she at last pretended to be won over by mere<br>
dint of entreaties, promises, and, above all, by the dazzling sum she<br>
took care to wind him up to the specification of, when it was now even<br>
a piece of art to feign, at once, a yielding to the allurements of a<br>
great interest, as a pretext for her yielding at all, and the manner of<br>
it such as might persuade him she had never dipped her virtuous fingers<br>
in an affair of that sort.<br>
<br>
Thus she led him through all the gradations of difficulty, and<br>
obstacles, necessary to enhance the value of the prize he aimed at; and<br>
in conclusion, he was so struck with the little beauty I was mistress<br>
of, and so eagerly bent on gaining his ends of me, that he left her no<br>
room to boast of her management in bringing him up to her mark, he<br>
drove so plump of himself into every thing tending to make him swallow<br>
the bait. Not but, in other respects, Mr. Norbert was not clear sighted<br>
enough, or that he did not perfectly know the town, and even by<br>
experience, the very branch of imposition now in practice upon him: but<br>
we had his passion our friend so much, he was so blinded and hurried on<br>
by it, that he would have thought any undeception a very ill office<br>
done to his pleasure. Thus concurring, even precipitately, to the point<br>
she wanted him at, Mrs. Cole brought him at last to hug himself on the<br>
cheap bargain he considered the purchase of my imaginary jewel was to<br>
him, at no more than three hundred guineas to myself, and a hundred to<br>
the brokers: being a slender recompense for all her pains, and all the<br>
scruples of conscience she had now sacrificed to him for this first<br>
time of her life; which sums were to be paid down on the nail, upon<br>
delivery of my person, exclusive of some no inconsiderable presents<br>
that had been made in the course of the negociation: during which I had<br>
occasionally, but sparingly been introduced into his company, at proper<br>
times and hours; in which it is incredible how little it seemed<br>
necessary to strain my natural disposition to modesty higher, in order<br>
to pass it upon him for that a very maid: all my looks and gestures<br>
ever breathing nothing but that innocence which the men so ardently<br>
require in us, for no other end than to feast themselves with the<br>
pleasure of destroying it, and which they are so grievously, with all<br>
their skill, subject to mistakes in.<br>
<br>
When the articles of the treaty had been fully agreed on, the<br>
stipulated payments duly secured, and nothing now remained but the<br>
execution of the main point, which centered in the surrender of my<br>
person up to his free disposal and use, Mrs. Cole managed her<br>
objections, especially to his lodgings, and insinuations so nicely,<br>
that it became his own mere notion and urgent request, that this copy<br>
of a wedding should be finished at her house: &ldquo;At first, indeed, she<br>
did not care, not she, to have such doings in it... she would not for a<br>
thousand pounds have any of the servants or apprentices know it... her<br>
precious good name would be gone for ever...,&rdquo; with the like excuses.<br>
However, on superior objections to all other expedients, whilst she<br>
took care to start none but those which were most liable to them it<br>
came round at last to the necessity of her obliging him in that<br>
conveniency, and of doing a little more where she had already done so<br>
much.<br>
<br>
The night then was fixed, with all possible respect to the eagerness of<br>
his impatience, and in the mean time Mrs. Cole had omitted no<br>
instructions, nor even neglected any preparation, that might enable me<br>
to come off with honour, in regard to the appearance of my virginity,<br>
except that, favoured as I was by nature with all the narrowness of<br>
stricture in that part requisite to conduct my designs, I had no<br>
occasion to borrow those auxiliaries of art that create a momentary<br>
one, easily discovered by the test of a warm bath; and as to the usual<br>
sanguinary symptoms of defloration, which, if not always, are generally<br>
attendants on it, Mrs. Cole had made me the mistress of an invention of<br>
her own, which could hardly miss its effect, and of which more in its<br>
place.<br>
<br>
Every thing then being disposed and fixed for Mr. Norbert&rsquo;s reception,<br>
he was, at the hour of eleven at night, with all the mysteries of<br>
silence and secrecy, let in by Mrs. Cole herself, and introduced into<br>
her bedchamber, where, in an old-fashioned bed of her&rsquo;s, I lay, fully<br>
undressed, and panting, if not with the fears of a real maid, at least<br>
with those perhaps greater of a dissembled one which gave me an air of<br>
confusion and bashfulness that maiden-modesty had all the honour of,<br>
and was indeed scarce distinguishable from it, even by less partial<br>
eyes than those of my lover: so let me call him, for I ever thought the<br>
term &ldquo;cully&rdquo; too cruel a reproach to the men, for their abused weakness<br>
for us.<br>
<br>
As soon as Mrs. Cole, after the old gossipery, on these occasions, used<br>
to young women abandoned for the first time to the will of man, had<br>
left us alone in her room, which, by the bye was well lighted up, at<br>
his previous desire, that seemed to bode a stricter examination than he<br>
afterwards made, Mr. Norbert, still dressed, sprung towards the bed,<br>
where I got my head under the clothes, and defended them a good while<br>
before he could even get at my lips, to kiss them: so true it is, that<br>
a false virtue, on this occasion, even makes &amp; greater rout and<br>
resistance than a true one. From thence he descended to my breasts, the<br>
feel I disputed tooth and nail with him till tired with my resistance,<br>
and thinking probable to give a better account to me, he hurried his<br>
clothes off in an instant, and came into bed.<br>
<br>
Mean while by the glimpse I stole of him, I could easily discover a<br>
person far from promising any such doughty performances as the storming<br>
of maidenheads generally requires, and whose flimsy consumptive texture<br>
gave him more the air of an invalid that was pressed, than of a<br>
volunteer, on such hot service.<br>
<br>
At scarce thirty he had already reduced his strength of appetite down<br>
to a wretched dependance on forced provocatives, very little seconded<br>
by the natural power of a body jaded, and racked off to the less by<br>
constant repeated over draughts of pleasure, which had done the work of<br>
sixty winters on his springs of live: leaving him at the same time all<br>
the fire and head of youth in his imagination, which served at once to<br>
torment and spur him down the precipice.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was in bed, he threw off the bedclothes, which I suffered<br>
him to force from my hold, and I now lay as exposed as he could wish,<br>
not only to his attacks, but his visitation of the sheets; where in the<br>
various agitations of the body, through my endeavours to defend myself,<br>
he could easily assure himself there was no preparation, though, to do<br>
him justice, he seemed a less strict examinant than I had apprehended<br>
from so experienced a practitioner. My shift then he fairly tore open,<br>
finding I made too much use of it to barricade my breasts, as well as<br>
the more important avenue: yet in every thing else he proceeded with<br>
all the marks of tenderness and regard to me, whilst the art of my play<br>
was to shew none for him, I acted them all the niceties, apprehensions,<br>
and terrors, supposable for a girl perfectly innocent to feel, at so<br>
great a novelty as a naked man in bed with her for the first time. He<br>
scarce even obtained a kiss but what he ravished; I put his hand away<br>
twenty times from my breasts, where he had satisfied himself of their<br>
hardness and consistence, with passing for hitherto unhandled goods.<br>
But when grown impatient upon the main point, he now threw himself upon<br>
me, and first trying to examine me with his finger, sought to make<br>
himself further way, I complained of his usage bitterly: &ldquo;I thought he<br>
would not have served a body so... I was ruined... I did not know what<br>
I had done..., I would get up, so I would...;&rdquo; and at the same time<br>
kept my thighs so fast locked, that it was not for strength like his to<br>
force them open, or do any good. Finding thus my advantages, and that I<br>
had both my own and his motions at command, the deceiving him came so<br>
easy, that it was perfectly playing upon velvet. In the mean time his<br>
machine, which was one of those sizes that slip in and out without<br>
being minded, kept pretty stiffly bearing against that part, which the<br>
shutting my thighs barred access to; but finding, at length he could do<br>
no good by mere dint of bodily strength, he resorted to entreaties and<br>
arguments: to which I only answered, with a tone of shame and timidity,<br>
&ldquo;that I was afraid he would kill me... Lord!..., would not be served<br>
so... I was never so used in all my born days..., I wondered he was not<br>
ashamed of himself, so I did...,&rdquo; with such silly infantine moods of<br>
repulse and complaint as I judged best adapted to express the character<br>
of innocence, and affright. Pretending, however, to yield at length to<br>
the vehemence of his insistence, in action and words, I sparing<br>
disclosed my thighs, so that he could just touch the cloven inlet with<br>
the tip of his instrument: but as he fatigued and toiled to get in, a<br>
twist of my body, so as to receive it obliquely, not only thwarted his<br>
admission, but giving a scream, as if he had pierced me to the heart, I<br>
shook him off me, with such violence that he could not with all his<br>
might to it, keep the saddle: vexed indeed at this he seemed, but not<br>
in the style of displeasure with me for my skittishness; on the<br>
contrary, I dare swear he held me the dearer, and hugged himself for<br>
the difficulties that even hurt his instant pleasure. Fired, however,<br>
now beyond all bearance of delay, he remounts, and begged of me to have<br>
patience, stroking and soothing me to it by all the tenderest<br>
endearments and protestations of what he would moreover do for me; at<br>
which, feigning to be somewhat softened, and abating of the anger that<br>
I had shewn at his hurting me so prodigiously, I suffered him to lay my<br>
thighs aside, and make way for a new trial; but I watched the<br>
directions and management of his point so well, that no sooner was the<br>
orifice in the least open to it, but I gave such a timely jerk as<br>
seemed to proceed not from the evasion of his entry, but from the pain<br>
his efforts at it put me to: a circumstance too that I did not fail to<br>
accompany with proper gestures, sighs and cries of complaint, of which,<br>
&ldquo;that he had hurt me... he killed me... I should die...,&rdquo; were the most<br>
frequent interjections. But now, after repeated attempts, in which he<br>
had not made the least impression towards gaining his point, at least<br>
for that time, the pleasure rose so fast upon him, that he could not<br>
check or delay it, and in the vigour and fury which the approaches of<br>
the height of it inspired him, he made one fierce-thrust, that had<br>
almost put me by my guard, and lodged it so far that I could feel the<br>
warm inspersion just within the exterior orifice, which I had the<br>
cruelty not to let him finish there, but threw him out again, not<br>
without a most piercing loud exclamation, as if the pain had put me<br>
beyond all regard of being overheard. It was then easy to observe that<br>
he was more satisfied, more highly pleased with the supposed motives of<br>
his baulk of consummation, than he would have-been at the full<br>
attainment of it. It was on this foot that I solved to myself all the<br>
falsity I employed to procure him that blissful pleasure in it, which<br>
most certainly he would not have tasted in the truth of things. Eased,<br>
however, and relieved by one discharge, he now applied himself to<br>
sooth, encourage, and to put me into humour and patience to bear his<br>
next attempt, which he began to prepare and gather force for, from all<br>
the incentives of the touch and sight which he could think of, by<br>
examining every individual part of my whole body, which he declared his<br>
satisfaction with, in raptures of applause, kisses universally<br>
imprinted, and sparing no part of me, in all the eagerest wantonness of<br>
feeling, seeing, and toying. His vigour, however, did not return so<br>
soon, and I felt him more than once pushing at the door, but so little<br>
in a condition to break in, that I question whether he had the power to<br>
enter, had I held it ever so open; but this he then thought me too<br>
little acquainted with the nature of things, to have any regret or<br>
confusion about, and he kept fatiguing himself and me for a long time,<br>
before he was in any state to resume his attacks with any prospect of<br>
success and then I breathed him so warmly, and kept him so at bay, that<br>
before he had made any sensible progress in point of penetration, he<br>
was deliciously sweated, and wearied out indeed: so that it was deep in<br>
the morning before he achieved his second let-go, about half way of<br>
entrance, I all the while crying and complaining of his prodigious<br>
vigour, and the immensity of what I appeared to suffer splitting up<br>
with. Tired, however, at length, with such athletic drudgery, my<br>
champion began now to give out, and to gladly embrace the refreshment<br>
of some rest. Kissing me then with much affection, and recommending me<br>
to my repose, he presently fell fast asleep, which, as soon as I had<br>
well satisfied myself of, I with much composure of body, so as not to<br>
wake him by any motion, with much ease and safety too, played of Mrs.<br>
Cole&rsquo;s device for perfecting the signs of my virginity. In each of the<br>
head bed-posts, just above where the bedsteads are inserted into them,<br>
there was a small drawer, so artfully adapted to the mouldings of the<br>
timber-work, that it might have escaped even the most curious search:<br>
which drawers were easily opened or shut by the touch of a spring, and<br>
were fitted each with a shallow glass tumbler, full of a prepared fluid<br>
blood, in which lay soaked, for ready use, a sponge, that required no<br>
more than gently reaching the hand to it, taking it out and properly<br>
squeezing between the thighs, when it yelded a great deal more of the<br>
red liquid than would save a girl&rsquo;s honour; after which, replacing it,<br>
and touching the spring, all possibility of discovery, or even of<br>
suspicion, was taken away; and this was not the work of the fourth part<br>
of a minute, and of which ever side one lay, the thing was equally easy<br>
and practicable, by the double care taken to have each bed-post<br>
provided alike. True it is, that had he waked and caught me in the act,<br>
it would at least have covered me with shame and confusion; but them,<br>
that he did not, was, with the precautions I took, a risk of a thousand<br>
to one in my favour.<br>
<br>
At ease now, and out of all fear of any doubt or suspicion on his side,<br>
I addressed myself in good earnest to my repose, but could obtain none;<br>
and in about half an hour&rsquo;s time my gentleman waked again, and turning<br>
towards me, I feigned a sound sleep, which he did not long respect; but<br>
girding himself again to renew the onset, he began to kiss and caress<br>
me, when now making as if I just waked, I complained of the<br>
disturbance, and of the cruel pain that this little rest had stole my<br>
senses from. Eager, however, for the pleasure, as well of consummating<br>
an entire triumph over my virginity, he said every thing that could<br>
overcome my resistance, and bribe my patience to the end, which now I<br>
was ready to listen to, from being secure of the bloody proofs I had<br>
prepared of his victorious violence, though I still thought it good<br>
policy not to let him in yet a while. I answered then only to his<br>
importunities in sighs and moans, &ldquo;that I was so hurt, I could not bear<br>
it... I was sure he had done me a mischief; that he had... he was such<br>
a bad man!&rdquo; At this, turning down the clothes, and viewing the field of<br>
battle by the glimmer of a dying taper, he saw plainly my thighs,<br>
shift, and sheet, all stained with what he readily took for a virgin<br>
effusion, proceeding from his last half penetration: convinced, and<br>
transported at which, nothing could equal his joy and exultation. The<br>
illusion was complete, no other conception entered his head, but that<br>
of his having been at work upon an unopened mine; which idea, upon so<br>
strong an evidence, redoubled at once his tenderness for me, and his<br>
ardour for breaking it wholly up. Kissing me then with the utmost<br>
rapture, he comforted me, and begged my pardon for the pain he had put<br>
me to: observing withal, that it was only a thing in course; but the<br>
worst was certainly past, and that with a little courage and constancy,<br>
I should get it once well over, and never after experience any thing<br>
but the greatest pleasure. By little and little I suffered myself to be<br>
prevailed on, and giving, as it were, up to the point of him, I made my<br>
thighs, insensibly spreading them, yield him liberty of access, which<br>
improving, he got a little within me, when by a well managed reception<br>
I worked the female screw so nicely, that I kept him from the easy<br>
mid-channel direction, and by dexterous wreathing and contortions,<br>
creating an artificial difficulty of entrance, made him win it inch by<br>
inch, with the most laborious struggles, I all the while sorely<br>
complaining: till at length, with might and main, winding his way in,<br>
he got it completely home, and giving my virginity, as he thought, the<br>
coup le grace, furnished me with the cue of setting up a terrible<br>
outcry, whilst he, triumphant and like a cock clapping his wings over<br>
his down-trod mistress, pursued his pleasure: which presently rose, in<br>
virtue of this idea of a complete victory, to a pitch that made me soon<br>
sensible of his melting period; whilst I now lay acting the deep<br>
wounded, breathless, frightened, undone, no longer maid.<br>
<br>
You would ask me, perhaps, whether all this time I enjoyed any<br>
perception of pleasure? I assure you, little or none, till just towards<br>
the latter end, a faintish sense of it came on mechanically, from so<br>
long a struggle and frequent fret in that ever sensible part; but, in<br>
the first place, I had no taste for the person I was suffering the<br>
embraces of, on a pure mercenary account; and then, I was not entirely<br>
delighted with myself for the jade&rsquo;s part I was playing, whatever<br>
excuses I might plead for my being brought into it; but then this<br>
insensibility kept me so much the mistress of my mind and motions, that<br>
I could the better manage so close a counterfeit, through the whole<br>
scene of deception.<br>
<br>
Recovered at length to a more shew of life, by his tender condolences,<br>
kisses and embraces, I upbraided him, and reproached him with my ruin,<br>
in such natural terms, as added to his satisfaction with himself, for<br>
having accomplished it; and guessing, by certain observations of mine,<br>
that it would be rather favourable to him, to spare him, when he some<br>
time after, feebly enough, came on again to the assault, I resolutely<br>
withstood any further endeavours, on a pretext that flattered his<br>
prowess, of my being so violently hurt and sore, that I could not<br>
possibly endure a fresh trial. He then graciously granted me a respite,<br>
and the next morning soon after advancing, I got rid of further<br>
importunity, till Mrs. Cole, being rung for by him, came in and was<br>
made acquainted, in terms of the utmost joy and rapture, with his<br>
triumphant certainty of my virtue, and the finishing stroke he had<br>
given it, in the course of the night: of which, he added, she would see<br>
proof enough in bloody characters, on the sheets.<br>
<br>
You may guess how a woman of her turn of address and experience<br>
humoured the jest, and played him off with mixed exclamations of shame,<br>
danger, compassion for me, and of her being pleased that all was so<br>
well over: in which last, I believe, she was certainly sincere. And<br>
now, as the objection which she had represented as an invincible one,<br>
to me lying the first night at his lodgings (which were studiously<br>
calculated for freedom of intrigues), on the account of my maiden fears<br>
and terrors, at the thought of going to a gentleman&rsquo;s chambers, and<br>
being alone with him in bed, was surmounted, she pretended to persuade<br>
me, in favour to him, that I should go there to him, whenever he<br>
pleased, and still keep up all the necessary appearances of working<br>
with her, that I might not lose, with my character, the prospect of<br>
getting a good husband, and at the same time her house would be kept<br>
safer from scandal. All this seemed so reasonable, so considerate to<br>
Mr. Norbert, that he never once perceived that she did not want him to<br>
resort to her house, lest he might in time discover certain<br>
inconsistencies with the character she had set out with to him: besides<br>
that this plan greatly flattered his own ease, and views of liberty.<br>
<br>
Leaving me then to my much wanted rest, he got up, and Mrs. Cole, after<br>
settling with him all points relating to me, got him undiscovered out<br>
of the house. After which, as I was awake, she came in, and gave me due<br>
praises for my success. Behaving too with her usual moderation and<br>
disinterestedness, she refused any share of the sum I had thus earned,<br>
and put me into such a secure and easy way of disposing of my affairs,<br>
which now amounted to a kind of little fortune, that a child of ten<br>
years old might have kept the account and property of them safe in its<br>
hands.<br>
<br>
I was now restored again to my former state of a kept mistress, and<br>
used punctually to wait on Mr. Norbert at his chambers whenever he sent<br>
a messenger for me, which I constantly took care to be in the way of,<br>
and managed with so much caution, that he never once penetrated the<br>
nature of my connections with Mrs. Cole; but indolently given up to<br>
ease and the town dissipations, the perpetual hurry of them hindered<br>
him from looking into his own affairs, much less to mine.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, if I may judge from my own experience, none are<br>
better paid, or better treated, during their reign, than the mistress<br>
of those who, enervate by nature, debaucheries, or age, have the least<br>
employment for the sex: sensible that a woman must be satisfied some<br>
way, they ply her with a thousand little tender attentions, presents,<br>
caresses, confidences, and exhaust their inventions in means and<br>
devices to make up for the capital deficiency; and even towards<br>
lessening that, what arts, what modes, what refinements of pleasure<br>
have they not recourse to, to raise their languid powers, and press<br>
nature into the service of their sensuality? But here is their<br>
misfortune, that when by a course of teasing, worrying, handling,<br>
wanton postures, lascivious motions, they have at length accomplished a<br>
flashy enervate enjoyment, they at the same time light up a flame in<br>
the object of their passion, that, not having the means themselves to<br>
quench, drives her for relief into the next person&rsquo;s arms, who can<br>
finish their work; and thus they become bawds to some favourite, tried<br>
and approved of, for a more vigorous and satisfactory execution; for<br>
with women, of our turn especially, however well our hearts may be<br>
disposed, there is a controlling part, or queen-seat in us, that<br>
governs itself by its own maxims of state, amongst which not one is<br>
stronger, in practice with it, than, in the matter of is dues, never to<br>
accept the will for the deed.<br>
<br>
Mr. Norbert, who was much in this ungracious case, though he professed<br>
to like me extremely, could but seldom consummate the main-joy itself<br>
with me, without such a length and variety of preparations, as were at<br>
once wearisome and inflammatory.<br>
<br>
Sometimes he would strip me stark naked on a carpet, by a good fire,<br>
when he would contemplate me almost by the hour, disposing me in all<br>
the figures and attitudes of body that it was susceptible of being<br>
viewed in; kissing me in every part, the most secret and critical one<br>
so far from excepted that it received most of that branch of homage.<br>
Then his touches were so exquisitely wanton, so luxuriously diffused<br>
and penetrative at times, that he had made me perfectly rage with<br>
titillating fires, when, after all, and much ado, he had gained a<br>
short-lived erection, he would perhaps melt it away in a washy sweat,<br>
or a premature abortive effusion, that provokingly mocked my eager<br>
desires: or, if carried home, how faultered and unnervous the<br>
execution! how insufficient the sprinkle of a few heat-drops to<br>
extinguish all the flames he had kindled!<br>
<br>
One evening, I cannot help remembering, that returning home from him,<br>
with a spirit he had raised in a circle his wand had proved too weak to<br>
lay, as I turned the corner of a street, I was overtaken by a young<br>
sailor, I was then in that spruce, neat, plain dress, which I ever<br>
affected and perhaps might have, in my trip, a certain air of<br>
restlessness unknown to the composure of cooler thoughts. However, he<br>
seized me as a prize, and without farther ceremony threw his arms round<br>
my neck, and kissed me boisterously and sweetly. I looked at him with a<br>
beginning of anger and indignation at his rudeness, that softened away<br>
into other sentiments as I viewed him: for he was tall, manly<br>
carriaged, handsome of body and face, so that I ended my stare, with<br>
asking him, in a tone turned to tenderness, what he meant; at which,<br>
with the same frankness and vivacity as he had begun with me, he<br>
proposed treating me with a glass of wine. Now, certain it is, that had<br>
I been in a calmer state of blood than I was, had I not been under the<br>
dominion of unappeased irritation; but I do not know how it was, my<br>
pressing calls, his figure, the occasion, and if you will, the powerful<br>
combination of all these, with a start of curiosity to see the end of<br>
an adventure, so novel too as being treated like a common street-plyer,<br>
made me give a silent consent; in short, it was not my head that I now<br>
obeyed, I suffered myself to be towed along as it were by this<br>
man-of-war, who took me under his arm as familialry as if he had known<br>
me all his lifetime, and led me into the next convenient tavern, where<br>
we were shown into a little room on one side of the passage. Here,<br>
scarce allowing himself patient till the drawer brought in the wine<br>
called for, he fell directly on board me: when, untucking my<br>
handkerchief, and giving me a snatching buss, he laid my breasts bare<br>
at once, which he handled with that keenness of gust that abridges a<br>
ceremonial evermore tiresome than pleasing on such pressing occasions;<br>
and now, hurrying towards the main point, we found no conveniency to<br>
our purpose, two or three disabled chairs, and a rickety table,<br>
composing the whole furniture of the room. Without more ado, he plans<br>
me with my back standing against the wall, and my petticoats up; and<br>
coming out with a splitter indeed, made it shine, as he brandished it,<br>
in my eyes; and going to work with an impetuosity and eagerness, bred<br>
very likely by a long fast at seat, went to give me a taste of it. I<br>
straddled, I humoured my posture, and did my best in short to buckle to<br>
it; I took part of it in, but still things did not go to his thorough<br>
liking; changing them in a trice his system of battery, he leads me to<br>
the table and with a master-hand lays my head down on the edge of it,<br>
and, with the other canting up my petticoats and shift, bares my naked<br>
posteriors to his blind and furious guide; it forces its way between<br>
them, and I feeling pretty sensibly that it was not going by the right<br>
door, and knocking desperately at the wrong one, I told him of<br>
it:&mdash;&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my dear, any port in a storm.&rdquo; Altering, however,<br>
directly his course, and lowering his point, he fixed it right, and<br>
driving it up with a delicious stiffness, made all foam again, and gave<br>
me the tout with such fire and spirit, that in the fine disposition I<br>
was in when I submitted to him and stirred up so fiercely as I was, I<br>
got the start of him, and went away into the melting swoon, and<br>
squeezing him, whilst in the convulsive grasp of it, drew from him such<br>
a plenteous bedewal, as pointed to my own effusion, perfectly floated<br>
those parts, and drowned in a deluge all my raging conflagration of<br>
desire.<br>
<br>
When this was over, how to make my retreat was my concern; for, though<br>
I had been so extremely pleased with the difficult between this warm<br>
broadside, poured so briskly into me, and the tiresome pawing and<br>
toying to which I had owed the unappeased flames that had driven me<br>
into this step, now I was cooler, I began to apprehend the danger of<br>
contracting an acquaintance with this, however agreeable stranger; who,<br>
on his side, spoke of passing the evening with me and continuing our<br>
intimacy, with an air of determination that made me afraid of its being<br>
not so easy to get away from him as I could wish. In the mean time I<br>
carefully concealed my uneasiness, and readily pretended to consent to<br>
stay with him, telling him I should only step to my lodgings to leave a<br>
necessary direction, and then instantly return. This he very glibly<br>
swallowed, on the notion of my being one of those unhappy<br>
street-errants, who devote themselves to the pleasure of the first<br>
ruffian that will stoop to pick them up, and of course, that I would<br>
scarce bilk myself of the hire, by not returning make the most of the<br>
job. Thus he parted with me, not before, however, he had ordered in my<br>
hearing a supper, which I had the barbarity to disappoint him of my<br>
company too.<br>
<br>
But when I got home, and told Mrs. Cole my adventure, she represented<br>
so strongly to me the nature and dangerous consequences of my folly,<br>
particularly the risks to my health, in being so openlegged and free,<br>
that I not only took resolutions never to venture so rashly again,<br>
which I inviolably preserved, but passed a good many days in continual<br>
uneasiness, lest I should have met with other reasons, besides the<br>
pleasure of that rencounter, to remember it; but these fears wronged my<br>
pretty sailor, for which I gladly make him this reparation.<br>
<br>
I had now lived with Mr. Norbert near a quarter of a year, in which<br>
space I circulated my time very pleasantly, between my amusements at<br>
Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s, and a proper attendance on that gentleman, who paid me<br>
profusely for the unlimited complaisance with which I passively<br>
humoured every caprice of pleasure, and which had won upon him so<br>
greatly, that finding, as he said, all that variety in me alone, which<br>
he had sought for in a number of women, I had made him lose his taste<br>
for inconstancy, and new faces. But what was yet at least agreeable, as<br>
well as more flattering, the love I had inspired him with, bred a<br>
deference to me, that was of great service to his health: for having by<br>
degrees, and with much pathetic representations brought him to some<br>
husbandry of it, and to insure the duration of his pleasures by<br>
moderating their use, and correcting those excesses in them he was so<br>
addicted to, and which had shattered his constitution and destroyed his<br>
powers of life in the very point for which he seemed desirous to live,<br>
he was grown more delicate, more temperate, and in course more healthy;<br>
his gratitude for which was taking a turn very favourable for my<br>
fortune, when once more the caprice of it dashed the cup from my lips.<br>
<br>
His sister, lady L..., for whom he had a great affection, desiring him<br>
to accompany her down to Bath for her health, he could not refuse her<br>
such a favour; and accordingly, though he counted on staying away from<br>
me no more than a week at farthest, he took his leave of me with an<br>
ominous heaviness of heart, and left me a sum far above the state of<br>
his fortune, and very inconsistent with the intended shortness of his<br>
journey; but it ended in the longest that can be, and is never but once<br>
taken: for, arrived at Bath, he was not there two days before he fell<br>
into a debauch of drinking with some gentlemen, that threw him into a<br>
high fever, and carried him off in four days&rsquo; time, never once out of a<br>
delirium. Had he been in his senses to make a will, perhaps he might<br>
have made favourable mention of me in it. Thus, however, I lost him;<br>
and as no condition of life is more subject to revolutions than that of<br>
a woman of pleasure, I soon recovered my cheerfulness, and now beheld<br>
myself once more struck off the list of kept mistresses, and returned<br>
into the bosom of the community, from which I had been in some manner<br>
taken.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cole still continued her friendship, and offered me her assistance<br>
and advice towards another choice; but I was now in ease and affluence<br>
enough to look about me at leisure; and as to any constitutional calls<br>
of pleasure, their pressure, or sensibility, was greatly lessened by a<br>
consciousness of the ease with which they were to be satisfied at Mrs.<br>
Cole&rsquo;s house, where Louisa and Emily still continued in the old way;<br>
and my great favourite Harriet used often to come and see me, and<br>
entertain me, with her head and heart full of the happiness she enjoyed<br>
with her dear baronet, whom she loved with a tenderness and constancy,<br>
even though he was her keeper, and what is yet more, had made her<br>
independent, by a handsome provision for her and hers. I was then in<br>
this vacancy from any regular employ of my person in my way of<br>
business, when one day, Mrs. Cole, in the course of the constant<br>
confidence we lived in, acquainted me that there was one Mr. Barville,<br>
who used her house, just come to town, whom she was not a little<br>
perplexed about providing a suitable companion for; which was indeed a<br>
point of difficulty, as he was under the tyranny of a cruel taste: that<br>
of an ardent desire, not only of being unmercifully whipped himself,<br>
but of whipping others, in such sort, that though he paid extravagantly<br>
those who had the courage and complaisance to submit to his humour,<br>
there were few, delicate as he was in the choice of his subjects, who<br>
would exchange turns with him so terribly at the expense of their skin.<br>
But, what yet increased the oddity of this strange fancy was the<br>
gentleman being young; whereas it generally attacks, it seems, such as<br>
are, through age, obliged to have recourse to this experiment, for<br>
quickening the circulation of their sluggish juices, and determining a<br>
conflux of the spirits of pleasure towards those flagging shrivelly<br>
parts, that rise to life only by virtue of those titillating ardours<br>
created by the discipline of their opposites, with which they have so<br>
surprising a consent.<br>
<br>
This Mrs. Cole could not well acquaint me with, in any expectation of<br>
my offering for service: for, sufficiently easy as I was in my<br>
circumstances, it must have been the temptation of an immense interest<br>
indeed, that could have induced me to embrace such a job, neither had I<br>
ever expressed, nor indeed, felt the least impulse or curiosity to know<br>
more of a taste, that promised so much more pain than pleasure to those<br>
that stood in no need of such violent goads: what then should move me<br>
to subscribe myself voluntarily to a party of pain, foreknowing it<br>
such? Why, to tell the plain truth, it was a sudden caprice, a gust of<br>
fancy for trying a new experiment, mixed with the vanity of approving<br>
my personal courage to Mrs. Cole, that determined me, at all risks, to<br>
propose myself to her and relieve her from any further look-out.<br>
Accordingly, I at once pleased and surprised her, with a frank and<br>
unreserved tender of my person to her and her friend&rsquo;s absolute<br>
disposal on this occasion.<br>
<br>
My good temporal mother was, however, so kind as to use all the<br>
arguments she could imagine to dissuade me: but, as I found they only<br>
turned on a motive of tenderness to me, I persisted in my resolution,<br>
and thereby acquitted my offer of any suspicion of its not having been<br>
sincerely made, or out of compliment only. Acquiescing then thankfully<br>
in it, Mrs. Cole assured me &ldquo;that bating the pain I should be put to,<br>
she had no scruple to engage me to this party, which she assured me I<br>
should be liberally paid for, and which, the secrecy of the transaction<br>
preserved safe from the ridicule that otherwise vulgarly attended it;<br>
that for her part, she considered pleasure, of one sort or other, as<br>
the universal port of destination, and every wind that blew thither a<br>
good one, provided it blew nobody any harm; that she rather<br>
compassionated, than blamed those unhappy persons, who are under a<br>
subjection they cannot shake off, to those arbitrary tastes that rule<br>
their appetites of pleasures with an unaccountable control: tastes too,<br>
as infinitely diversified, as superior to, and independent of all<br>
reasoning as the different relishes or palates of mankind in their<br>
viands, some delicate stomach nauseating plain meats, and finding no<br>
savour but in highseasoned, luxurious dishes, whilst others again pique<br>
themselves upon detesting them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I stood now in no need of this preamble of encouragement, or<br>
justification: my word was given, and I was determined to fulfill my<br>
engagements. Accordingly the night was set, and I had all the necessary<br>
previous instructions how to act and conduct myself. The dining room<br>
was duly prepared and lighted up, and the young gentleman posted there<br>
in waiting, for my introduction to him.<br>
<br>
I was then, by Mrs. Cole, brought in, and presented to him, in a loose<br>
dishabille fitted, by her direction, to the exercise I was to go<br>
through, all in the finest linen and a thorough white uniform: gown,<br>
petticoat, stocking, and satin slippers, like a victim led to<br>
sacrifice; whilst my dark auburn hair, falling in drop-curls over my<br>
neck, created a pleasing distinction of colour from the rest of my<br>
dress.<br>
<br>
As soon as Mr. Barville saw me, he got up, with a visible air of<br>
pleasure and surprise, and saluting me, asked Mrs. Cole, if so fine and<br>
delicate a creature would voluntarily submit to such sufferings and<br>
rigours, as were the subject of his assignation. She answered him<br>
properly, and now, reading in his eyes that she could not too soon<br>
leave us together, she went out, after recommending to him to use<br>
moderation with so tender a novice.<br>
<br>
But whilst she was employing his attention, mine had been taken up with<br>
examining the figure and person of this unhappy young gentleman, who<br>
was thus unaccountably condemned to have his pleasure lashed into him,<br>
as boys have their learning.<br>
<br>
He was exceedingly fair, and, smooth complexioned, and appeared to me<br>
no more than twenty at most, though he was three years older than what<br>
my conjectures gave him; but then he owed this favourable mistake to a<br>
habit of fatness, which spread through a short, squab stature; and a<br>
round, plump, fresh coloured face gave him greatly the look of a<br>
Bacchus, had not an air of austerity, not to say sternness, very<br>
unsuitable even to his shape of face, dashed that character of joy,<br>
necessary to complete the resemblance. His dress was extremely neat,<br>
but plain, and far inferior to the ample fortune he was in full<br>
possession of; this too was a taste in him, and not avarice.<br>
<br>
As soon as Mrs. Cole was gone, he seated me near him, when now his face<br>
changed upon me, into an expression of the most pleasing sweetness and<br>
good humour, the most remarkable for its sudden shift from the other<br>
extreme, which I found afterwards, when I knew more of his character,<br>
was owing to a habitual state of conflict with, and dislike of himself,<br>
for being enslaved to so peculiar a lust, by the fatality of a<br>
constitutional ascendant, that rendered him incapable of receiving any<br>
pleasure, till he submitted to these extraordinary means of procuring<br>
it at the hands of pain, whilst the constancy of this repining<br>
consciousness stamped at length that cast of sourness and severity on<br>
his features: which was, in fact, very foreign to the natural sweetness<br>
of his temper.<br>
<br>
After a competent preparation by apologies, and encouragement to go<br>
through my part with spirit and constancy, he stood up near the fire,<br>
whilst I went to fetch the instruments of discipline out of a closet<br>
hard by: these were several rods, made each of two or three strong<br>
twigs of birch tied together, which he took, handled, and viewed with<br>
as much pleasure, as I did with a kind of shuddering presage.<br>
<br>
Next we took from the side of the room a long broad bench, made easy to<br>
lie at length on by a soft cushion in a callico-cover; and everything<br>
being now ready, he took his coat and waistcoat off; and at his motion<br>
and desire, I unbuttoned his breeches, and rolling up his shirt rather<br>
above his waist, tucked it on securely there; when directing naturally<br>
my eyes to that humoursone master-movement, in whose favour all these<br>
dispositions were making, it seemed almost shrunk into his body, scarce<br>
showing its tip above the sprout of hairy curls that clothed those<br>
parts, as you may have-seen a wren peeping its head out of the grass.<br>
<br>
Stooping them to untie his garters, he gave them to me for the use of<br>
tying him down to the legs of the bench: a circumstance no farther<br>
necessary than, as I suppose, it made part of the humour of the thing,<br>
since he prescribed it to himself, amongst the rest of the ceremonial.<br>
<br>
I led him then to the bench, and according to my cue, played at forcing<br>
him to lie down: which, after-some little show of reluctance, for<br>
form-sake, he submitted to; he was straightway extended flat upon his:<br>
belly, on the bench, with a pillow under his face; and as he thus<br>
tamely lay, I tied him slightly hand and feet, to the legs of it; which<br>
done, his shirt remaining trussed up over the small of his back, I drew<br>
his breeches quite down to his knees; and now he lay, in all the<br>
fairest, broadest display of that part of the back-view; in which a<br>
pair of chubby, smooth-cheeked and passing white posteriors rose<br>
cushioning upwards from two stout, fleshful thighs, and ending their<br>
cleft, or separation by an union at the small of the back, presented a<br>
bold mark, that swelled, as it were, to meet the scourge.<br>
<br>
Seizing now one of the rods, I stood over him, and according to his<br>
direction, gave him in one breath, ten lashes with much good-will, and<br>
the utmost nerve and vigour of arm that I could put to them, so as to<br>
make those fleshy orbs quiver again under them; whilst he himself<br>
seemed no more concerned, or to mind them, than a lobster would a<br>
flea-bite. In the mean time, I view intently the effect of them, which<br>
to me at last appeared surprisingly cruel: every lash had skimmed the<br>
surface of those white cliffs, which they deeply reddened, and lapping<br>
round the side of the furthermost from me, cut specially, into the<br>
dimple of it, such livid weals, as the blood either spun out from, or<br>
stood in large drops on; and, from some of the cuts, I picked out even<br>
the splinters of the rod that had stuck in the skin. Nor was this raw<br>
work to be wondered at, considering the greenness of the twigs and the<br>
severity of the infliction, whilst the whole surface of the skin was so<br>
smooth-stretched over the hard and firm pulp of flesh that filled it,<br>
as to yield no play, or elusive swagging under the stroke: which<br>
thereby took place the more plump, and cut into the quick.<br>
<br>
I was however already so moved at the piteous sight, that I from my<br>
heart repented the undertaking, and would willing had given over,<br>
thinking he had full enough; but, he encouraging and beseeching me<br>
earnestly to proceed, I gave him ten more lashes; and then resting,<br>
surveyed the increase of bloody appearances. And at length, steeled to<br>
the height, by his stoutness in suffering, I continued the discipline,<br>
by intervals, till I observed him wreathing and twisting his body, in a<br>
way that I could plainly perceive was not the effect of pain, but of<br>
some new and powerful sensation: curious to dive into the meaning of<br>
which, in one of my pauses of intermission, I approached, as he still<br>
kept working, and grinding his belly against the cushion under him: and<br>
first stroking the untouched and unhurt side of the flesh-mount next<br>
me, then softly insinuating my hand under his thigh, felt the posture<br>
things were in forwards, which was indeed surprising: for that machine<br>
of him, which I had, by its appearance, taken for an impalpable, or at<br>
least a very diminutive subject, was now, in virtue of all that smart<br>
and havoc of his skin behind, grown not only to a prodigious stiffness<br>
of erection, but to a size that frighted even me: a non-pareil<br>
thickness indeed! the head of it alone filled the utmost capacity of my<br>
grasp. And when, as he heaved and wriggled to and fro, in the agitation<br>
of his strange pleasure, it came into view, it had something of the air<br>
of a round fillet of veal, and like its owner, squab, and short in<br>
proportion to its breadth; but when he felt my hand there, he begged I<br>
would go on briskly with my jerking, or he should never arrive at the<br>
last stage of pleasure.<br>
<br>
Resuming then the rode and the exercise of it, I had fairly worn out<br>
three bundles, when, after an increase of struggles and motion, and a<br>
deep sigh or two, I saw him lie still and motionless; and now he<br>
desired me to desist, which I instantly did; and proceeding to untie<br>
him, I could not but be amazed at his passive fortitude, on viewing the<br>
skin of his butchered, mangled posteriors, late so white, smooth and<br>
polished, now all one side of them a confused cut-work of weals, livid<br>
flesh, gashes and gore, insomuch that when he stood up, he could scarce<br>
walk; in short, he was in sweet-briars.<br>
<br>
Then I plainly perceived, on the cushion, the marks of a plenteous<br>
effusion, and already had his sluggard member run up to its old<br>
nestling-place, and enforced itself again, as if ashamed to shew its<br>
head; which nothing, it seems, could raise but stripes inflicted on its<br>
opposite neighbours, who were thus constantly obliged to suffer for his<br>
caprice.<br>
<br>
My gentleman had now put on his clothes and recomposed himself, when<br>
giving me a kiss, and placing me by him, he sat himself down as<br>
gingerly as possible, with one side off the cushion, which was too sore<br>
for him to bear resting any part of his weight on.<br>
<br>
Here he thanked me for the extreme pleasure I had procured him, and<br>
seeing, perhaps, some marks in my countenance of terror and<br>
apprehension of retaliation on my own skin, for what I had been the<br>
instrument of his suffering in his, he assured me, &ldquo;he was ready to<br>
give up to me any engagement I might deem myself under to stand him, as<br>
he had done me, but that if I proceeding in my consent to it, he would<br>
consider the difference of my sex, its greater delicacy and incapacity<br>
to undergo pain.&rdquo; Reheartened at which, and piqued in honour, as I<br>
thought, not to flinch so near the trial, especially as I well knew<br>
Mrs. Cole was an eye-witness, from her stand of espial, to the whole of<br>
our transaction, I was now less afraid of my skin, than of his not<br>
furnishing me with an opportunity of signalizing my resolution.<br>
<br>
Consonant to this disposition was my answer, but my courage was still<br>
more in my head, than in my heart; and as cowards rush into danger they<br>
fear, in order to be the sooner rid of the pain of that sensation, I<br>
was entirely pleased with his hastening matters into execution.<br>
<br>
He had then little to do, but to unloose the strings of my petticoats,<br>
and lift them, together with my shift, navel-high, where he just tucked<br>
them up loosely, and might be slipt up higher at pleasure. Then viewing<br>
me round with great seeming delight, he laid me at length on my face<br>
upon the bench, and when I expected he would tie me, as I had done him,<br>
and held out my hands, not without fear and a little trembling, he told<br>
me, &ldquo;he would by no means terrify me unnecessarily with such a<br>
confinement; for that though he meant to put my constancy to a trial,<br>
the standing it was to be completely voluntary on my side, and<br>
therefore I might be at full liberty to get up whenever I found the<br>
pain too much for me.&rdquo; You cannot imagine how much I thought myself<br>
bound, by being thus allowed to remain loose, and how much spirit this<br>
confidence in me gave me, so that I was even from my heart careless how<br>
much my flesh might suffer in honour of it.<br>
<br>
All my back parts, naked half way up, were now fully at his mercy: and<br>
first, he stood at a convenient distance, delighting himself with a<br>
gloating survey of the attitude I lay in, and of all the secret stores<br>
I thus exposed to him in fair display. Then, springing eagerly towards<br>
me, he covered all those naked parts with a fond profusion of kisses;<br>
and now, taking hold of the rod, rather wantoned with me, in gentle<br>
inflictions on those tender trembling masses of my flesh behind, than<br>
in any way hurt them, till by degrees, he began to tingle them with<br>
smarter lashes, so as to provoke a red colour into them, which I knew,<br>
as well by the flagrant glow I felt there, as by his telling me, they<br>
now emulated the native roses of my other cheeks. When he had thus<br>
amused himself with admiring, and toying with them, he went on to<br>
strike harder, and more hard, so that I needed all my patience not to<br>
cry out, or complain at least. At last, he twigged me so smartly as to<br>
fetch blood in more than one lash: at sight of which he flung down the<br>
rod, flew to me, kissed away the starting drops, and sucking the wounds<br>
eased a good deal of my pain. But now raising me on my knees, and<br>
making me kneel with them straddling wide, that tender part of me,<br>
naturally the province of pleasure, not of pain, came in for its share<br>
of suffering: for now, eyeing it wistfully, he directed the rod so that<br>
the sharp ends of the twigs lighted there, so sensibly, that I could<br>
not help wincing, and writhing my limbs with smart; so that my<br>
contortions of body must necessarily throw it into infinite variety of<br>
postures and points of view, fit to feast the luxury of the eye. But<br>
still I bore every thing without crying out: when presently giving me<br>
another pause, he rushed, as it were, on that part whose lips, and<br>
round about, had felt this cruelty, and by way of reparation, glued his<br>
own to them; then he opened, shut, squeezed them, plucked softly the<br>
overgrowing moss, and all this in a style of wild passionate rapture<br>
and enthusiasm, that expressed excess of pleasure; till betaking<br>
himself to the rod again, encouraged by my passiveness, and infuriated<br>
with this strange taste of delight, he made my poor posteriors pay for<br>
the ungovernableness of it; for now showing them no quarter, the<br>
traitor cut me so, that I wanted but little of fainting away, when he<br>
gave over. And yet I did not utter one groan, or angry expostulation;<br>
but in my heart I resolved nothing so seriously, as never to expose<br>
myself again to the like severities.<br>
<br>
You may guess then in what a curious pickle those soft flesh-cushions<br>
of mine were, all so red, raw, and in fine, terribly clawed off; but so<br>
far from feeling any pleasure in it, that the recent smart made me pout<br>
a little, and not with the greatest air of satisfaction receive the<br>
compliments, and after-caresses of the author of my pain.<br>
<br>
As soon as my clothes were huddled on in a little decency, a supper was<br>
brought in by the discreet Mrs. Cole herself, which might have piqued<br>
the sensuality of a cardinal, accompanied with a choice of the richest<br>
wines: all which she set before us, and went out again, without having,<br>
by a word or even by a smile, given us the least interruption or<br>
confusion, in those moments of secrecy, that we were not yet ripe to<br>
the admission of a third too.<br>
<br>
I sat down then, still scarce in charity with my butcher, for such I<br>
could not help considering him, and was moreover not a little piqued at<br>
the gay, satisfied air of his countenance, which I thought myself<br>
insulted by. But when the now necessary refreshment to me of a glass of<br>
wine, and a little eating (all the time observing a profound silence)<br>
had somewhat cheered and restored me to spirits, and as the smart began<br>
to go off, my good humour returned accordingly: which alteration not<br>
escaping him, he said and did every thing that could confirm me in, and<br>
indeed exalt it.<br>
<br>
But scarce was supper well over, before a change so incredible was<br>
wrought in me, such violent, yet pleasingly irksome sensations took<br>
possession of me that I scarce knew how to contain myself; the smart of<br>
the lashes was now converted into such a prickly heat, such fiery<br>
tinglings, as made me sigh, squeeze my thighs together, shift and<br>
wriggle about my seat, with a furious restlessness; whilst these<br>
itching ardours, thus excited in those parts on which the storm of<br>
discipline had principally fallen, detached legions of burning,<br>
subtile, stimulating spirits, to their opposite spot and centre of<br>
assemblage, where their titillation raged so furiously, that I was even<br>
stinging made with them. No wonder then that in such a taking, and<br>
devoured by flames that licked up all modesty and reserve, my eyes, now<br>
charged brimful of the most intense desire, fired on my companion very<br>
intelligible signal of distress: my companion, I say, who grew in them<br>
every instant more amiable, and more necessary to my urgent wishes and<br>
hopes of immediate ease.<br>
<br>
Mr. Barville, no stranger, by experience, to these situations, soon<br>
knew the pass I was brought to soon perceived my extreme disorder; in<br>
favour of which, removing the table out of the way, he began a prelude<br>
that flattered me with instant relief, to which I was not, however, so<br>
near as I imagined: for as he was unbuttoned to me, and tried to<br>
provoke and rouse to action his unactive torpid machine, he blushingly<br>
owned that no good was to be expected from it, unless I took it in hand<br>
to re-excite its languid loitering powers, by just refreshing the smart<br>
of the yet recent blood-raw cuts, seeing it could, no more than a boy&rsquo;s<br>
top, keep up without lashing. Sensible then that I should work as much<br>
for my own profit as his, I hurried my compliance with his desire, and<br>
abridging the ceremonial, whilst he leaned his head against the back of<br>
a chair, I had scarce gently made him feel the lash, before I saw the<br>
object of my wishes give signs of life, and presently, as it were with<br>
a magic touch, is started up into a noble size and distinction indeed.<br>
Hastening then to give me the benefit of it, he threw me down on the<br>
bench; but such was the refreshed soreness of those parts behind, on my<br>
leaning so hard on them, as became me to compass the admission of that<br>
stupendous head of his machine, that I could not possibly bear it. I<br>
got up then, and tried, by leaning forwards, and turning the crupper on<br>
my assailant, to let him at the back avenue: but here it was likewise<br>
impossible to stand his bearing so fiercely against me, in his<br>
agitations and endeavours to enter that way, whilst his belly battered<br>
directly against the recent sore. What should we do now? both<br>
intolerably heated: both in a fury; but pleasure is ever inventive for<br>
its own ends: he strips me in a trice stark naked, and placing a broad<br>
settee-cushion on the carpet before the fire, oversets me gently, topsy<br>
turvy, on it; and handling me only at the waist, whilst you may be sure<br>
I favoured all my dispositions, brought my legs round his neck; so that<br>
my head was kept from the floor only by my hands and the velvet<br>
cushion, which was now bespread with my flowing hair: thus I stood on<br>
my head and hands, supported by him in such manner, that whilst my<br>
thighs clung round him, so as to expose to his sight all my back<br>
figure, including the theatre of his bloody pleasure, the centre of my<br>
fore pair fairly bearded the object of its rage, that now stood in<br>
fine condition to give me satisfaction for the injuries of its<br>
neighbours. But as this posture was certainly not the easiest, and our<br>
imaginations, wound up to the height, could suffer no delay, he first,<br>
with the utmost eagerness and effort, just lip-lodged that broad<br>
acorn-fashioned head of his instrument; and still befriended by the<br>
fury with which he had made that impression, he soon stuffed in the<br>
rest; when now, with a pursuit of thrusts, fiercely urged, he<br>
absolutely overpowered and absorbed all sense of pain and uneasiness,<br>
whether from my wounds behind, my most untoward posture, or the<br>
oversize of his stretcher, in an infinitely predominant delight; when<br>
now all my whole spirits of life and sensation rushing, impetuously to<br>
the cock-pit, where the prize of pleasure was hotly in dispute and<br>
clustering to a point there, I soon received the dear relief of nature<br>
from these over-violent strains and provocations of it; harmonizing<br>
with which, my gallant spouted into me such a potent overflow of the<br>
balsamic injection, as softened and unedged all those irritating stings<br>
of a new species of titillation, which I had been so intolerably<br>
maddened with, and restored the ferment of my senses to some degree of<br>
composure.<br>
<br>
I had now achieved this rare adventure ultimately much more to my<br>
satisfaction than I had bespoken the nature of it to turn out; nor was<br>
it much lessened, you may think, by spark&rsquo;s lavish praises of my<br>
constancy and complaisance, which he gave weight to by a present that<br>
greatly surpassed my utmost expectation, besides his gratification to<br>
Mrs. Cole.<br>
<br>
I was not, however, at any time re-enticed to renew with him, or resort<br>
again to the violent expedient of lashing nature into more haste than<br>
good speed: which, by the way, I conceive acts somewhat in the manner<br>
of a dose of Spanish flies; with more pain perhaps, but less danger;<br>
and might be necessary to him, but was nothing less so than to me,<br>
whose appetite wanted the bridle more than the spur.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Cole, to whom this adventurous exploit had more and more endeared<br>
me, looked on me now as a girl after her own heart, afraid of nothing,<br>
and, on a good account, hardly enough to fight all the weapons of<br>
pleasure through. Attentive then, in consequence of these favourable<br>
conceptions, to promote either my profit or pleasure, she had special<br>
regard for the first, in a new gallant of a very singular turn, that<br>
she procured for and introduced to me.<br>
<br>
This was a grave staid, solemn, elderly gentleman, whose peculiar<br>
humour was a delight in combing fine tresses of hair; and as I was<br>
perfectly headed to his taste, he used to come constantly at my toilet<br>
hours, when I let down my hair as loose as nature, and abandoned it to<br>
him to do what he pleased with it; and accordingly he would keep me an<br>
hour or more in play with it, drawing the comb through it, winding the<br>
curls round his fingers, even kissing it as he smoothed it; and all<br>
this led to no other use of my person, or any other liberties whatever,<br>
any more than if a distinction of sexes had not existed.<br>
<br>
Another peculiarity of taste he had, which was to present me with a<br>
dozen pairs of the whitest kid gloves at a time: these he would divert<br>
himself with drawing on me, and then biting off their finger ends; all<br>
which fooleries of a silly appetite, the old gentleman paid more<br>
liberally for, than most others did for more essential favours. This<br>
lasted till a violent cough, seizing and laying him up, delivered me<br>
from this most innocent and insipid trifler, for I never heard more of<br>
him after his first retreat.<br>
<br>
You may be sure a by-job of this sort interfered with no other pursuit,<br>
or plan of life; which I led, in truth, with a modesty and reserve that<br>
was less the work of virtue than of exhausted novelty, a glut of<br>
pleasure, and easy circumstances, that made me indifferent to any<br>
engagements in which pleasure and profit were not eminently united; and<br>
such I could, with the less impatience, wait for at the hands of time<br>
and fortune, as I was satisfied I could never mend my pennyworths,<br>
having evidently been served at the top of the market, and even been<br>
pampered with dainties: besides that, in the sacrifice of a few<br>
momentary impulses, I found a secret satisfaction in respecting myself,<br>
as well as preserving the life and freshness of my complexion. Louisa<br>
and Emily did not carry indeed their reserve so high as I did; but<br>
still they were far from cheap or abandoned, though two of their<br>
adventures seemed to contradict this general character, which, for<br>
their singularity, I shall give you in course, beginning first with<br>
Emily&rsquo;s:<br>
<br>
Louisa and she went one night to a ball, the first in the habit of a<br>
shepherdess, Emily in that of a shepherd: I saw them in their dresses<br>
before they went, and nothing in nature could represent a prettier boy<br>
than this last did, being so fair and well limbed. They had kept<br>
together for some time, when Louisa, meeting an old acquaintance of<br>
hers, very cordially gives her companion the slip, and leaves her under<br>
the protection of her boy&rsquo;s habit, which was not much, and of her<br>
discretion, which was, it seems, still less. Emily, finding herself<br>
deserted, sauntered thoughtless about a while, and, as much for<br>
coolness and air as any thing else, at length pulled off her mask and<br>
went to the sideboard; where, eyed and marked out by a gentleman in a<br>
very handsome domino, she was accosted by, and fell into chat with him.<br>
The domino, after a little discourse, in which Emily doubtless<br>
distinguished her good nature and easiness more than her wit, began to<br>
make violent love to her, and drawing her insensibly to some benches at<br>
the lower end of the masquerade room, got her to sit by him, where he<br>
squeezed her hands, pinched her cheeks, praised and played with her<br>
fine hair, admired her complexion, and all in a style of courtship<br>
dashed with a certain oddity, that not comprehending the mystery of,<br>
poor Emily attributed to his falling in with the humour of her<br>
disguise; and being naturally not the cruellest of her profession,<br>
began to incline to a parley on those essentials. But here was the<br>
stress of the joke: he took her really for what she appeared to be, a<br>
smock-faced boy; and she, forgetting her dress, and of course ranging<br>
quite wide of his ideas, took all those address to be paid to herself<br>
as a woman, which she precisely owed to his not thinking her one.<br>
However, this double error was pushed to such a height on both sides,<br>
that Emily, who saw nothing in him but a gentleman of distinction by<br>
those points of dress to which his disguise did not extend, warmed too<br>
by the wine he had plyed her with, and the caresses he had lavished<br>
upon her, suffered herself to be persuaded to go to a bagnio with him;<br>
and thus, losing sight of Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s cautions, with a blind<br>
confidence, put herself into his hands, to be carried wherever he<br>
pleased. For his part, equally blinded by his wishes, whilst here<br>
gregious simplicity favoured his deception more than the most exquisite<br>
art could have done, he supposed, no doubt, that he had lighted on some<br>
soft simpleton, fit for his; purpose, or some kept minion broken to his<br>
hand, who understood him perfectly well, and entered into his designs.<br>
But, be that as it would, he led her to a coach, went into it with her,<br>
and brought her to a very handsome apartment, with a bed in it; but<br>
whether it was a bagnio or not, she could not tell, having spoken to<br>
nobody but himself. But when they were alone together, and her<br>
inamorato began to proceed to those extremities which instantly<br>
discover the sex, she remarked, that no description could paint up to<br>
the life, the mixture of pique, confusion and disappointment, that<br>
appeared in his countenance, joined to the mournful exclamation: &ldquo;By<br>
heavens, a woman!&rdquo; This at once opened her eyes, which had been shut in<br>
downright stupidity. However, as if he had meant to retrieve that<br>
escape, he still continued to toy with and fondle her, but with so<br>
staring an alteration from extreme warmth into a chill and forced<br>
civility, that even Emily herself could not but take notice of it, and<br>
now began to wish she had paid more regard to Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s premonitions<br>
against ever engaging with a stranger. And now an excess of timidity<br>
succeeded to an excess of confidence, and she thought herself so much<br>
at his mercy and discretion, that she stood passive throughout the<br>
whole progress of his prelude: for now, whether the impressions of so<br>
great a beauty had even made him forgive her sex, or whether her<br>
appearance or figure in that dress still humoured his first illusion,<br>
he recovered by degrees a good part of his first warmth, and keeping<br>
Emily with her breeches still unbuttoned, stript them down to her<br>
knees, and gently impelling her to lean down, with her face against the<br>
bed-side, placed her so, that the double way, between the double rising<br>
behind, presented the choice fair to him, and he was so fairly set on a<br>
mis-direction, as to give the girl no small alarms for fear of losing a<br>
maidenhead she had not dreamt of. However, her complaints, and a<br>
resistance, gentle, but firm, checked and brought him to himself again;<br>
so that turning his steed&rsquo;s head, he drove him at length in the right<br>
road, in which his imagination having probably made the most of those<br>
resemblances that flattered his taste, he got, with much ado, to his<br>
journey&rsquo;s end: after which, he led her out himself, and walking with<br>
her two or three streets length, got her a chair, when making her a<br>
present not any thing inferior to what she could have expected, he left<br>
her, well recommended to the chairmen, who, on her directions, brought<br>
her home.<br>
<br>
This she related to Mrs. Cole and me the same morning, not without the<br>
visible remains of the fear and confusion she had been in, still<br>
stamped on her countenance. Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s remark was, that her<br>
indiscretion proceeding from a constitutional facility, there were<br>
little hopes of any thing curing her of it, but repeated severe<br>
experience. Mine was, that I could not conceive how it was possible for<br>
mankind to run into a taste, not only universally odious, but absurd,<br>
and impossible to gratify; since, according to the notions and<br>
experience I had of things, it was not in nature to force such immense<br>
disproportions. Mrs. Cole only smiled at my ignorance, and said nothing<br>
towards my undeception, which was not affected but by ocular<br>
demonstration, some months after, which a most singular accident<br>
furnished me, and which I will here set down, that I may not return<br>
again to so disagreeable a subject.<br>
<br>
I had, on a visit intended to Harriet, who had taken lodgings at<br>
Hampton-court, hired a chariot to go out thither, Mrs. Cole having,<br>
promised to accompany me; but some indispensable business intervening,<br>
to detain her, I was obliged to set out alone; and scarce had I got a<br>
third of my way, before the axle-tree broke down, and I was well off to<br>
get out, safe and unhurt, into a public-house, of a tolerable handsome<br>
appearance, on the road. Here the people told me that the stage would<br>
come by in a couple of hours at farthest, upon; which, determining to<br>
wait for it, sooner than lose the jaunt I had got so far forward on, I<br>
was carried into a very clean decent room, up one pair of stairs, which<br>
I took possession of for the time I had to stay, in right of calling<br>
for sufficient to do the house justice.<br>
<br>
Here, whilst I was amusing myself with looking out of the window, a<br>
single horse-chaise stopt at the door, out of which lightly leaped two<br>
young&rsquo; gentlemen, for so they seemed, who came in only as it were to<br>
bait and refresh a little, for they gave their horse to be held in<br>
readiness against they came out. And presently I heard the door of the<br>
next room, where they were let in, and called about them briskly; and<br>
as soon as they were served, I could just hear that they shut and<br>
fastened the door on the inside.<br>
<br>
A spirit of curiosity, far from sudden, since I do not know when I was<br>
without it, prompted me, without any particular suspicion, or other<br>
drift or view, to see what they were, and examine their persons and<br>
behaviour. The partition of our rooms was one of those moveable ones<br>
that, when taken down, served occasionally to lay them into one, for<br>
the conveniency of as larger company; and now, my nicest search could<br>
not shew me the shadow of a peep-hole, a circumstance which probably<br>
had not escaped the review of the parties on the other side, whom much<br>
it stood upon not to be deceived in it; but at length I observed a<br>
paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal<br>
some flaw; but then it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a<br>
chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point<br>
of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient.<br>
And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and<br>
could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about,<br>
entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.<br>
<br>
The eldest might be, on my nearest guess, towards nineteen, a tall<br>
comely young man, in a white fustian frock, with a green velvet cape,<br>
and cut bob-wig.<br>
<br>
The youngest could not be above seventeen, fair, ruddy, completely well<br>
made, and to say the truth, a sweet pretty stripling: he was too, I<br>
fancy, a country lad, by his dress, which was a green plush frock, and<br>
breeches of the same, white waistcoat and stockings, a jockey cap, with<br>
his yellowish hair, long and loose, in natural curls.<br>
<br>
But after a look of circumspection, which I saw the eldest cast every<br>
way round the room, probably in too much hurry and heat not to overlook<br>
the very small opening I was posted at, especially at the height it<br>
was, whilst my eye close to it kept the light from shining through and<br>
betraying it, he said something to his companion that presently changed<br>
the face of things.<br>
<br>
For now the elder began to embrace, to press and kiss the younger, to<br>
put his hands into his bosom, and give him such manifest signs of an<br>
amorous intention, as made me conclude the other to be a girl in<br>
disguise: a mistake that nature kept me in countenance for, for she had<br>
certainly made one, when she gave him the male stamp.<br>
<br>
In the rashness then of their age, and bent as they were to accomplish<br>
their project of preposterous pleasure, at the risk of the very worst<br>
of consequences, where a discovery was nothing less than improbable,<br>
they now proceeded to such lengths as soon satisfied me what they were.<br>
<br>
For presently the eldest unbuttoned the other&rsquo;s breeches, and removing<br>
the linen barrier, brought out to view a white shaft, middle sized, and<br>
scarce fledged, when after handling and playing with it a little, with<br>
other dalliance, all received by the boy without other opposition than<br>
certain wayward coyness, ten times-more alluring than repulsive, he got<br>
him so turned round, with his face from him, to a chair that stood hard<br>
by; when knowing, I suppose, his office, the Ganymede now obsequiously<br>
leaned his head against the back of it, and projecting his body, made a<br>
fair mark, still covered with his shirt. As he thus stood in a side<br>
view to me, but fronting his companion, who, presently unmasking his<br>
battery, produced an engine that certainly deserved to be put to a<br>
better use, and very fit to confirm me in my disbelief of the<br>
possibility of things; being pushed to odious extremities, which I had<br>
built on the disproportion of parts; but this disbelief I was now cured<br>
of, as by my consent all young men should likewise be, that their<br>
innocence may not be betrayed into such snares, for want of knowing the<br>
extent of their danger: for nothing is more certain than that ignorance<br>
of advice is by no means a guard against it.<br>
<br>
Slipping, then, aside the young lad&rsquo;s shirt, and tucking it up under<br>
his clothes behind, he shewed to the open air those globular fleshy<br>
eminences that compose the Mount Peasants of Rome, and which now, with<br>
all the narrow vale that intersects them, stood displayed and exposed<br>
to his attack; nor could I without a shudder behold the dispositions he<br>
made for it. First, then, moistening well with spittle his instrument,<br>
obviously to make it glib, he pointed, he introduced it, as I could<br>
plainly discern, not only from its direction and my losing sight of it,<br>
but by the writhing, twisting and soft murmured complaints of the young<br>
sufferer; but at length, the first straits of entrance being pretty<br>
well go through, every thing seemed to move and go pretty currently on,<br>
as on a carpet road, without much rub or resistance; and now, passing<br>
one hand round his minions&rsquo; hips, he got hold of his red-topped ivory<br>
toy, that stood perfectly stiff, and shewed, that if he was like his<br>
mother behind, he was like his father before; this he diverted himself<br>
with, whilst, with the other he wantoned with his hair, and leaning<br>
forward over his back, drew his face, from which the boy shook the<br>
loose curls that fell over it, in the posture he stood him in, and<br>
brought him towards his, so as to receive a long breathed kiss; after<br>
which, renewing his driving, and thus continuing to harass his rear,<br>
the height of the fist came on with its usual symptoms, and dismissed<br>
the action.<br>
<br>
The criminal scene they acted, I had the patience to see to an end,<br>
purely that I might gather more facts and certainty against them in my<br>
design to do their deserts instant justice; and accordingly, when they<br>
had re-adjusted themselves; and were preparing to go out, burning as I<br>
was with rage and indignation, I jumped down from the chair, in order<br>
to raise the house upon them, but with such an unlucky impetuosity,<br>
that some nail or ruggedness in the floor caught my foot, and flung me<br>
on my face with such violence, that I fell senseless on the ground, and<br>
lay there some time before any one came to my relief: so that they,<br>
alarmed, I suppose, by the noise of my fall, had more than the<br>
necessary time to make a safe retreat. This they effected, as I learnt,<br>
with a precipitation nobody could account for, until, when come to<br>
myself, and composed enough to speak, I acquainted those of the house<br>
with the whole transaction I had been evidence to.<br>
<br>
When I came home again, and told Mrs. Cole this adventure, she very<br>
sensibly observed to me, that &ldquo;there was no doubt of the due vengeance<br>
one time or other overtaking these miscreants, however they might<br>
escape for the present; and that, had I been the temporal instrument of<br>
it, I should have been put to a great deal more trouble and confusion<br>
than I imagined; that, as to the thing itself, the less said of it was<br>
the better; but that though she might be suspected of partiality, from<br>
its being the common cause of womankind, out of whose mouths this<br>
practice tended to take something more than bread, yet she protested<br>
against any mixture of passion, with a declaration extorted from her by<br>
pure regard to truth; which was, that whatever effect this infamous<br>
passion had in other ages and other countries, it seemed a peculiar<br>
blessing on our air and climate, that there was a plaguespot visibly<br>
imprinted on all that are tainted with it, in this nation at least, for<br>
that among numbers of that stamp whom she had known, or at least were<br>
universally under the scandalous suspicion of it, she would not name an<br>
exception hardly to one of them, whose character was not, in all other<br>
respects, the most worthless and despicable that could be; stript of<br>
all the manly virtues of their own sex, and filled up with only the<br>
worst vices and follies of ours; that, in fine, they were scarce less<br>
execrable than ridiculous in their monstrous inconsistence, of loathing<br>
and contemning women, and at the same time apeing all their manners,<br>
airs, lisps, scuttle, and, in general, all their little modes of<br>
affectation, which become them at least better, than they do these<br>
unsexed, male misses.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
But here, washing my hands of them, I re-plunge into the stream of my<br>
history, which I may very properly ingraft a terrible sally of<br>
Louisa&rsquo;s, since I had some share in it myself, and have besides engaged<br>
myself to relate it, in point of countenance to poor Emily. It will<br>
add, too, one more example to thousands, in confirmation of the maxim,<br>
that women get once out of compass, there are no lengths of<br>
licentiousness, that they are not capable of running.<br>
<br>
One morning then, that both Mrs. Cole and Emily were gone out for the<br>
day, and only Louisa and I (not to mention the house-maid) were left in<br>
charge of the house, whilst we were loitering away the time, in looking<br>
through the shop windows, the son of a poor woman, who earned very hard<br>
bread indeed by mending of stockings, in a stall in the neighbourhood,<br>
offered us some nosegays, ranged round a small basket; by selling of<br>
which the poor boy eked out his mother&rsquo;s maintenance of them both: nor<br>
was he fit for any other way of livelihood, since he was not only a<br>
perfect changeling, or idiot, but stammered so that there was no<br>
understanding even those sounds his half-dozen animals ideas, at most,<br>
prompted him to utter.<br>
<br>
The boys and servants in the neighbourhood had given him the nick-name<br>
of good-natured Dick, from the soft simpleton&rsquo;s doing every thing he<br>
was bid at the first word, and from his naturally having no turn to<br>
mischief; then, by the way, he was perfectly well made, stout,<br>
clean-limbed, tall of his age, as strong as a horse, and, withal,<br>
pretty featured; so that he was not, absolutely, such a figure to be<br>
snuffled at neither, if your nicety could, in favour of such<br>
essentials, have dispensed with a face unwashed, hair tangled for want<br>
of combing, and so ragged a plight, that he might have disputed points<br>
of shew with any heathen philosopher of them all.<br>
<br>
This boy we had often seen, and bought his flowers, out of pure<br>
compassion, and nothing more; but just at this time as he stood<br>
presenting us his basket, a sudden whim, a start of wayward fancy,<br>
seized Louisa; and, without consulting me, she calls him in, and<br>
beginning to examine his nosegays, culls out two, one for herself,<br>
another for me, and pulling out half a crown, very currently gives it<br>
him to change, as if she had really expected he could have changed it:<br>
but the boy, scratching his head, made his signs explain his inability<br>
in place of words, which he could not, with all his struggles,<br>
articulate.<br>
<br>
Louisa, at this, says: &ldquo;Well, my lad, come up stairs with me, and I<br>
will give you your due,&rdquo; winking at the same time to me, and beckoning<br>
me to accompany her, which I did, securing first the street-door, that<br>
by this means, together with the shop, became wholly the care of the<br>
faithful house-maid.<br>
<br>
As we went up, Louisa whispered me &ldquo;that she had conceived a strange<br>
longing to be satisfied, whether the general rule held good with regard<br>
to this changeling, and how far nature had made him amends, in her best<br>
bodily gifts, for her denial of the sublimer intellectual ones; begin,<br>
at the same time, my assistance in procuring her this satisfaction.&rdquo; A<br>
want of complaisance was never my vice, and I was so far from opposing<br>
this extravagant frolic, that now, bit with the same maggot, and my<br>
curiosity conspiring with hers, I entered plump into it, on my own<br>
account.<br>
<br>
Consequently, soon as we came into Louisa&rsquo;s bed-chamber, whilst she was<br>
amusing him with picking out his nosegays, I undertook the lead, and<br>
began the attack. As it was not then very material to keep much<br>
measures with a mere natural, I made presently free with him, though at<br>
my first motion of meddling, his surprise and confusion made him<br>
receive my advances but awkwardly: nay, insomuch that he bashfully<br>
shied, and shied back a little; till encouraging him with my eyes,<br>
plucking him playfully by the hair, sleeking his cheeks, and forwarding<br>
my point by a number of little wantonnesses, I soon turned him<br>
familiar, and gave nature her sweetest alarm: so that aroused, and<br>
beginning to feel himself, we could, amidst all the innocent laugh and<br>
grin I had provoked him into, perceive the fire lighting in his eyes,<br>
and, diffusing over his cheeks, blend its glow with that of his<br>
blushes. The emotion in short of animal pleasure glared distinctly in<br>
the simpleton&rsquo;s countenance; yet struck with the novelty of the scene,<br>
he did not know which way to look or move; but tame, passive,<br>
simpering, with his mouth half open, in stupid rapture, stood and<br>
tractably suffered me to do what I pleased with him. His basket was<br>
dropt out of his hands, which Louisa took care of.<br>
<br>
I had now, through more than one rent, discovered and felt his thighs,<br>
the skin of which seemed the smoother and fairer for the coarseness,<br>
and even the dirt of his dress, as the teeth of negroes seem the whiter<br>
for the surrounded black; and poor indeed of habit, poor of<br>
understanding, he was, however, abundantly rich in personal treasures,<br>
such as flesh, firm, plump, and replete with the juices of youth, and<br>
robust well-knit limbs. My fingers too had now got within reach of the<br>
true, the genuine sensitive plant, which, instead of shrinking from the<br>
touch, joys to meet it, and swells and vegetates under it: mine<br>
pleasingly informed me that matters were so ripe for the discovery we<br>
meditated, that they were too mighty for the confinement they were<br>
ready to break. A waistband that I unskewered, and a rag of a shirt<br>
that I removed, and which could not have covered a quarter of it,<br>
revealed the whole of the idiot&rsquo;s standard of distinction, erect, in<br>
full pride and display: but such a one! it was positively of so<br>
tremendous a size, that prepared as we were to see something<br>
extraordinary, it still, out of measure, surpassed our expectation, and<br>
astonished even me, who had not been used to trade in trifles. In fine,<br>
it might have answered very well the making a skew of; its enormous<br>
head seemed, in hue and size, not unlike a common sheep&rsquo;s heart; then<br>
you might have trolled dice securely along the broad back of the body<br>
of it; the length of it too was prodigious; then the rich appendage of<br>
the treasure-bag beneath, large in proportion, gathered and crisped up<br>
round in shallow furrows, helped to fill the eye, and complete the<br>
proof of his being a natural, not quite in vain; since it was full<br>
manifest that he inherited, and largely too, the prerogative of majesty<br>
which distinguishes that otherwise most unfortunate condition, and gave<br>
rise to the vulgar saying &ldquo;That a fool&rsquo;s bauble is a lady&rsquo;s<br>
playfellow.&rdquo; Not wholly without reason: for, generally speaking, it is<br>
in love as it is in war, where the longest weapon carries it. Nature,<br>
in short, had done so much for him in those parts, that she perhaps<br>
held herself acquitted in doing so little for his head.<br>
<br>
For my part, who had sincerely no intention to push the joke further<br>
than simply satisfying my curiosity with the sight of it alone, I was<br>
content, in spite of the temptation that stared me in the face, with<br>
having raised a May-pole for another to hang a garland on: for, by this<br>
time, easily reading Louisa&rsquo;s desires in her wishful eyes, I acted the<br>
commodious part, and made her, who sought no better sport, significant<br>
terms of encouragement to go through stitch with her adventure;<br>
intimating too that I would stay and see fair play: in which, indeed, I<br>
had in view to humour a new born curiosity, to observe what appearances<br>
active nature would put on in a natural, in the course of this her<br>
darling operation.<br>
<br>
Louisa, whose appetite was up, and who, like the industrious bee, was,<br>
it seems, not above gathering the sweet of so rare a flower, though she<br>
found it planted on a dunghill, was but too readily disposed to take<br>
the benefit of my cession. Urged then strongly by her own desires, and<br>
emboldened by me, she presently determined to risk a trial of parts<br>
with the idiot, who was by this time nobly inflamed for her purpose, by<br>
all the irritation we had used to put the principles of pleasure<br>
effectually into motion, and to wind up the springs of its organ to<br>
their supreme pitch; and it stood accordingly stiff and straining,<br>
ready to burst with the blood and spirits that swelled it... to a bulk!<br>
No! I shall never forget it.<br>
<br>
Louisa then, taking and holding the fine handle that so invitingly<br>
offered itself, led the ductile youth, by that mastertool of his, as<br>
she stept backward towards the bed; which he joyfully gave way to,<br>
under the incitations of instinct, and palpably delivered up to the<br>
goad of desire.<br>
<br>
Stopped then by the bed, she took the fall she loved, and leaned to the<br>
most, gently backward upon it, still holding fast what she held, and<br>
taking care to give her clothes a convenient toss up, so that her<br>
thighs duly disclosed, and elevated, laid open all the outward prospect<br>
of the treasury of love: the rose-lipt overture presenting the cockpit<br>
so fair, that it was not in nature even for a natural to miss it. Nor<br>
did he: for Louisa, fully bent on grappling with it, and impatient of<br>
dalliance or delay, directed faithfully the point of the<br>
battering-piece, and bounded up with a rage of so voracious appetite,<br>
to meet and favour the thrust of insertion, that the fierce activity on<br>
both sides effected it with such pain of distention, that Louisa cried<br>
out violently, that she was hurt beyond bearing, that she was killed.<br>
But it was too late: the storm was up, and force was on her to give way<br>
to it; for now the man-machine, strongly worked upon by the sensual<br>
passion, felt so manfully his advantages and superiority, felt withal<br>
the sting of pleasure so intolerable, that maddening with it, his joys<br>
began to assume a character of furiousness, which made me tremble for<br>
the too tender Louisa. He seemed, at this juncture, greater than<br>
himself; his countenance, before so void of meaning, or expression, now<br>
grew big with the importance of the act he was upon. In short, it was<br>
not now that he was to be played the fool with. But, what is pleasant<br>
enough, I myself was awed into a sort of respect for him, by the comely<br>
terrors his motions dressed him in: his eyes shooting sparks of fire;<br>
his face glowing with ardours that gave another life to it; his teeth<br>
churning; his whole frame agitated with a raging ungovernable<br>
impetuosity: all sensibly betraying the formidable fierceness with<br>
which the genial instinct acted upon him. Butting then and goring all<br>
before him, and mad and wild like an ower-driven steer, he ploughs up<br>
the tender furrow all insensible to Louisa&rsquo;s complaints; nothing can<br>
stop, nothing can keep out a fury like his: with which, having once got<br>
its head in, its blind rage soon made way for the rest, piercing,<br>
rending, and breaking open all obstruction. The torn, split, wounded<br>
girl cries, struggles, invokes me to her rescue, and endeavours to get<br>
from under the young savage, or shake him off, but alas! in vain: her<br>
breath, might as soon have strength to have quelled his rough assault,<br>
or put him out of his course. And indeed, all her efforts and struggles<br>
were managed with such disorder, that they served rather to entangle,<br>
and fold her the faster in the twine of his boisterous arms; so that<br>
she was tied to the stake, and obliged to fight the match out, if she<br>
died for it. For his part, instinct-ridden as he was, the expressions<br>
of his animal passion, partaking something of ferocity, were rather<br>
worrying than kisses, intermixed with ravenous love-bites on her cheeks<br>
and necks, the prints of which did not wear out for some days after.<br>
<br>
Poor Louisa, however, bore up at length better than could have been<br>
expected: and though she suffered, and greatly too, yet, ever true to<br>
the good old cause, she suffered with pleasure and enjoyed her pain.<br>
And soon now, by dint of an enraged enforcement, the brute-machine,<br>
driven like a whirlwind, made all smoke again, and wedging its way up,<br>
to the utmost extremity, left her, in point of penetration, nothing to<br>
fear or to desire: and now,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,&rdquo;<br>
(Shakespeare.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Louisa lay, pleased to the heart, pleased to her utmost capacity of<br>
being so, with every fibre in those parts, stretched almost to<br>
breaking, on a rack of joy, whilst the instrument of all this<br>
over-fullness searched her senses with its sweet excess, till the<br>
pleasure gained upon her so, its point stung her so home, that catching<br>
at length the rage from her furious driver and sharing the riot of his<br>
wild rapture, she went wholly out of her mind into that favourite part<br>
of her body, the whole intenseness of which was so fervously filled,<br>
and employed: there alone she existed, all lost in those delirious<br>
transports, those extasies of the senses, which her winking eyes, the<br>
brightened vermilion of her lips and cheeks, and sighs of pleasure<br>
deeply fetched, so pathetically expressed. In short, she was now as<br>
mere a machine as much wrought on, and had her motions as little at her<br>
own command, as the natural himself, who, thus broke in upon her, made<br>
her feel with a vengeance his tempestuous mettle he battered with;<br>
their active loins quivered again with the violence of their conflict,<br>
till the surge of pleasure, foaming and raging to a height, drew down<br>
the pearly shower that was, to allay this hurricane. The purely<br>
sensitive idiot then first shed those tears of joy that attend its last<br>
moments, not without an agony of delight, and even almost a roar of<br>
rapture, as the gush escaped him; so sensibly too for Louisa, that she<br>
kept him faithful company, going off, in consent, with the old<br>
symptoms: a delicious delirium, a tremendous convulsive shudder, and<br>
the critical dying: Oh! And now, on his getting off she lay<br>
pleasure-drenched, and regorging its essential sweets; but quite spent,<br>
and gasping for breath, without other sensation of life than in those<br>
exquisite vibrations that trembled still on the strings of delight;<br>
which had been too intensively touched, and which nature had so<br>
ravishingly stirred with, for the senses to be quickly at peace from.<br>
<br>
As for the changeling, whose curious engine had been thus successfully<br>
played off, his shift of countenance and gesture had even something<br>
droll, or rather tragi-comic in it: there was now an air of sad<br>
repining foolishness, superadded to his natural one of no meaning and<br>
idiotism, as he stood with his label of manhood, now lank, unstiffened,<br>
becalmed, and flapping against his thighs, down which it reached half<br>
way, terrible even in its fall, whilst under the dejection of spirit<br>
and flesh, which naturally followed his eyes, by turns, cast down<br>
towards his struck standard, or piteously lifted to Louisa, seemed to<br>
require at her hands what he had so sensibly parted from to her, and<br>
now ruefully missed. But the vigour of nature, soon returning,<br>
dissipated the blast of faintness which the common law of enjoyment had<br>
subjected him to; and now his basket re-became his main concern, which<br>
I looked for, and brought him, whilst Louisa restored his dress to its<br>
usual condition, and afterwards pleased him perhaps more by taking all<br>
his flowers off his hands, and paying him, at his rate, for them, than<br>
if she had embarrassed him by a present, that he would have been<br>
puzzled to account for, and might have put others on tracing the<br>
motives of.<br>
<br>
Whether she ever returned to the attack I know not, and, to say truth,<br>
I believe not. She had had her freak out, and had pretty plentifully<br>
drowned her curiosity in a glut of pleasure, which, as it happened, had<br>
no other consequence than that the lad, who retained only a confused<br>
memory of the transaction, would, when he saw her, forget her in favour<br>
of the next woman, tempted, on the report of his parts, to take him in.<br>
Louisa herself did not long outstay this adventure at Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s (to<br>
whom, by the bye, we took care not to boast of our exploit, till all<br>
fear of consequences were clearly over): for an occasion presenting<br>
itself of proving her passion for a young fellow, at the expense of her<br>
discretion, proceeding all in character, she packed up her toilet, at<br>
half a day&rsquo;s warning, and went with him abroad, since which I entirely<br>
lost sight of her, and it never fell in my way to hear what became of<br>
her.<br>
<br>
But a few days after she had left us, two very occasion, not to wrong<br>
our training at Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s, especially favourites, and free of her<br>
academy, easily obtained her consent for Emily&rsquo;s and my acceptance of a<br>
party of pleasure, at a little but agreeable house, belonging to one of<br>
them situated not far up the river Thames, on the Surrey side.<br>
<br>
Every thing being settled, and it being a fine summer day, but rather<br>
of the warmest, we set out after dinner, and got to our rendezvous<br>
about four in the afternoon; where, landing at the foot of a neat,<br>
joyous pavilion, Emily and I were handed into it by our esquires, and<br>
there drank tea with a cheerfulness and gaiety, that the beauty of the<br>
prospect, the serenity of the weather, and the tender politeness of our<br>
sprightly gallants, naturally led us into.<br>
<br>
After tea, and taking a turn in the garden, my particular, who was the<br>
master of the house, and had in no sense schemed this party of pleasure<br>
for a dry one, proposed to us, with that frankness which his<br>
familiarity at Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s entitled him to, as the weather was<br>
excessively hot, to bathe together, under a commodious shelter that he<br>
had prepared expressly for that purpose, in a creek of the river, with<br>
which a side-door of the pavilion immediately communicated, and where<br>
we might be sure of having our diversion out, safe from interruption,<br>
and with the utmost privacy.<br>
<br>
Emily, who never refused anything, and I, who ever delighted in<br>
bathing, and had no exception to the person who proposed it, or to<br>
those pleasure it was easy to guess it implied, took care, on this<br>
occasion, not to wrong our training at Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s, and agreed to it<br>
with as good a grace as we could. Upon which, without loss of time, we<br>
returned instantly to the pavilion, one door of which opened into a<br>
tent, pitched before it, that with its marquise, formed a pleasing<br>
defense again the sun, or the weather, and was besides as private as we<br>
could wish. The lining of it, embossed cloth, represented a wild forest<br>
foliage, from the top, down to the sides, which, in the same stuff,<br>
were figured with fluted pilasters, with their spaces between filled<br>
with flower vases, the whole having a pay effect croon the eye,<br>
wherever you turned it.<br>
<br>
Then it reached sufficiently into the water, yet contained convenient<br>
benches round it, on the dry ground, either to keep our clothes, or...,<br>
or..., in short for more uses than resting upon. There was a side-table<br>
too, loaded with sweetmeats, jellies, and other eatables, and bottles<br>
of wine and cordials, by way of occasional relief from any rawness, or<br>
chill of the water, or from any faintness from whatever cause; and in<br>
fact, my gallant, who understood _ch&egrave;re enti&ecirc;re_ perfectly, and who,<br>
for taste (even if you would not approve this specimen of it) might<br>
have been comptroller of pleasures to a Roman emperor, had left no<br>
requisite towards convenience or luxury unprovided.<br>
<br>
As soon as we had looked round this inviting spot, and every<br>
preliminary of privacy was duly settled, strip was the word: when the<br>
young gentlemen soon dispatched the undressing each his partner and<br>
reduced us to the naked confession of all those secrets of person which<br>
dress generally hides, and which the discovery of was, naturally<br>
speaking, not to our disadvantage. Our hands, indeed, mechanically<br>
carried towards the most interesting part of us, screened, at first,<br>
all from the tufted cliff downwards, till we took them away at their<br>
desire, and employed them in doing them the same office, of helping off<br>
with their clothes; in the process of which, there passed all the<br>
little wantonnesses and frolics that you may easily imagine.<br>
<br>
As for my spark, he was presently undressed, all to his shirt, the<br>
fore-lappet of which as he leaned languishingly on me, he smilingly<br>
pointed to me to observe, as it bellied out, or rose and fell,<br>
according to the unruly starts of the motion behind it; but it was soon<br>
fixed, for now taking off his shirt, and naked as a Cupid, he shewed it<br>
me at so upright a stand, as prepared me indeed for his application to<br>
me for instant ease; but, though the sight of its fine size was fit<br>
enough to fire me, the cooling air, as I stood in this state of nature,<br>
joined to the desire I had of bathing-first, enabled me to put him off,<br>
and tranquillize him, with the remark, that a little suspense would<br>
only set a keener edge on the pleasure. Leading them the way, and<br>
shewing our friends an example of continency, which they were giving<br>
signs of losing respect to, we went hand in hand into the stream, till<br>
it took us up to our necks, where the no more than grateful coolness of<br>
the water gave my senses a delicious refreshment from the sultriness of<br>
the season, and made more alive, more happy in myself, and, in course,<br>
more alert, and open to voluptuous impressions.<br>
<br>
Here I laved and wantoned with the water, or sportively played with my<br>
companion, leaving Emily to deal with hers at discretion. Mine, at<br>
length, not content with making me take the plunge over head and ears,<br>
kept splashing me, and provoking me with all the little playful tricks<br>
he could devise, and which I strove not to remain in his debt for. We<br>
gave, in short, a loose to mirth; and now, nothing would serve him but<br>
giving his hand the regale of going over every part of me, neck,<br>
breast, belly, thighs, and all the _et c&aelig;tera_, so dear to the<br>
imagination, under the pretext of washing and rubbing them; as we both<br>
stood in the water, no higher now than the pit of our stomachs, and<br>
which did not hinder him from feeling, and toying with that leak that<br>
distinguishes our sex, and it so wonderfully water-tight: for his<br>
fingers, in vain dilating and opening it, only let more flame than<br>
water into it, be it said without a figure. At the same time he made me<br>
feel his own engine, which was so well wound up, as to stand even the<br>
working in water, and he accordingly threw one arm round my neck, and<br>
was endeavouring to get the better of that harsher construction bred by<br>
the surrounding fluid; and had in effect one his way so far as to make<br>
me sensible of the pleasing stretch of those nether lips, from the<br>
in-driving machine; when, independent of my not liking that awkward<br>
mode of enjoyment, I could not help interrupting him, in order to<br>
become joint spectators of a plan of joy, in hot operation between<br>
Emily and her partner; who impatient of the fooleries and dalliance of<br>
the bath, had led his nymph to one of the benches on the green bank,<br>
where he was very cordially proceeding to teach her the difference<br>
betwixt jest and earnest.<br>
<br>
There, setting her on his knee, and gliding one hand over the surface<br>
of that smooth polished snow-white skin of hers, which now doubly shone<br>
with a dew-bright lustre, and presented to the touch something like<br>
what one would imagine of animated ivory, especially in those<br>
ruby-nippled globes, which the touch is so fond of and delights to make<br>
love to, with the other he was lusciously exploring the sweet secret of<br>
nature, in order to make room for a stately piece of machinery, that<br>
stood up-reared, between her thighs, as she continued sitting on his<br>
lap, and pressed hard for instant intromission, which the tender Emily,<br>
in a fit of humour deliciously protracted, affected to decline, and<br>
elude the very pleasure she sighed for, but in a style of waywardness,<br>
so prettily put on, and managed, as to render it ten times more<br>
poignant; then her eyes, all amidst the softest dying languishment,<br>
expressed, ait once a mock denial and extreme desire, whilst her<br>
sweetness was zested with a coyness so pleasingly provoking, her moods<br>
of keeping him off were so attractive, that they redoubled the<br>
impetuous rage with, which, he covered her with kisses: and kisses<br>
that, whilst she seemed to shy from or scuffle for, the cunning wanton<br>
contrived such sly returns, of, as were, doubtless the sweeter for the<br>
gust she gave them, of being stolen ravished.<br>
<br>
Thus Emily, who knew no art but that which nature itself, in favour of<br>
her principal end, pleasure, had inspired her with, the art of<br>
yielding, coy&rsquo;d it indeed, but coy&rsquo;d it to the purpose; for with all<br>
her straining, her wrestling, and striving to break from the clasp of<br>
his arms, she was so far wiser yet than to mean it, that in her<br>
struggles, it was visible she aimed at nothing more than multiplying<br>
points of touch with him, and drawing yet closer the folds that held<br>
them every where entwined, like two tendrils of a vine intercurling:<br>
together: so that the same effect, as when Louisa strove in good<br>
earnest to disengage from the idiot, was now produced by different<br>
motives.<br>
<br>
Mean while, their emersion out of the cold water had caused a general<br>
glow, a tender suffusion of heightened carnation over their bodies;<br>
both equally white and smooth-skinned; so that as their limbs were thus<br>
amorously interwoven, in sweet confusion, it was scarce possible to<br>
distinguish who they respectively belonged to, but for the brawnier,<br>
bolder muscles of the stronger sex.<br>
<br>
In a little time, however, the champion was fairly in with her, and had<br>
tied at all points the true lover&rsquo;s knot; when now, adieu all the<br>
little refinements of a finessed reluctance; adieu the friendly feint!<br>
She was presently driven forcibly out of the power of using any art;<br>
and indeed, what art must not give way, when nature, corresponding with<br>
her assailant, invaded in the heart of her capital and carried by<br>
storm, lay at the mercy of the proud conqueror, who had made his entry<br>
triumphantly and completely? Soon, however, to become a tributary: for<br>
the engagement growing hotter and hotter, at close quarters, she<br>
presently brought him to the pass of paying down the dear debt to<br>
nature; which she had no sooner collected in, but, like a duellist who<br>
has laid his antagonist at his feet, when he has himself received a<br>
mortal wound, Emily had scarce time to plume herself upon her victory,<br>
but, shot with the same discharge, she, in a loud expiring sigh, in the<br>
closure of her eyes, the stretch-out of her limbs, and a remission of<br>
her whole frame, gave manifest signs that all was as it should be.<br>
<br>
For my part, who had not with the calmest patience stood in the water<br>
all this time, to view this warm action, I leaned tenderly on my<br>
gallant, and at the close of it, seemed to ask him with my eyes, what<br>
he thought of it; but he, more eager to satisfy me by his actions than<br>
by words or looks, as we shoaled the water towards the shore, showed me<br>
the staff of love so intensely set up, that had not even charity,<br>
beginning at home in this case, urged me to our mutual relief, it would<br>
have been cruel indeed to have suffered the youth to burst with<br>
straining, when the remedy was so obvious and so near at hand.<br>
<br>
Accordingly we took a bench, whilst Emily and her spark, who belonged<br>
it seems to the sea, stood at the side-board, drinking to our good<br>
voyage: for, as the last observed, we were well under weigh, with a<br>
fair wind up channel, and full-freighted; nor indeed were we long<br>
before we finished our trip to Cythera, and unloaded in the old haven;<br>
but, as the circumstances did not admit of much variation, I shall<br>
spare you the description.<br>
<br>
At the same time, allow me to place you here an excuse I am conscious<br>
of owing you, for having, perhaps, too much affected the figurative<br>
style; though surely, it can pass nowhere more allowable than in a<br>
subject which is so properly the province of poetry, nay, is poetry<br>
itself, pregnant with every flower of imagination and loving metaphors,<br>
even were not the natural expressions, for respects of fashion and<br>
sound, necessarily forbidden.<br>
<br>
Resuming now my history, you may please to know, that what with a<br>
competent number of repetitions, all in the same strain (and, by the<br>
bye, we have a certain natural sense that those repetitions are very<br>
much to the taste), what with a circle of pleasures delicately varied,<br>
there was not a moment lost to joy all the time we staid there, till<br>
late in the night we were re-escorted home by our esquires, who<br>
delivered us safe to Mrs. Cole, with generous thanks for our company.<br>
<br>
This too was Emily&rsquo;s last adventure in our way: for scarce a week<br>
after, she was, by an accident too trivial to detail to you the<br>
particulars, found out by her parents, who were in good circumstances,<br>
and who had been punished for their partiality to their son, in the<br>
loss of him, occasioned by a circumstance of their over indulgence to<br>
his appetite; upon which the so long engrossed stream of fondness,<br>
running violently in favour of this lost and inhumanly abandoned child<br>
whom if they had not neglected enquiry about, they might long before<br>
have recovered, they were now so over-joyed at the retrieval of her,<br>
that, I presume, it made them much less strict in examining the bottom<br>
of things: for they seemed very glad to take for granted, in the lump,<br>
every thing that the grave and decent Mrs. Cole was pleased to pass<br>
upon them; and soon afterwards sent her, from the country, handsome<br>
acknowledgment.<br>
<br>
But it was not so easy to replace to our community the loss of so sweet<br>
a member of it: for, not to mention her beauty, she was one of those<br>
mild, pliant characters, that if one does not entirely esteem, one can<br>
scarce help loving, which is not such a bad compensation neither. Owing<br>
all her weaknesses to good nature, and an indolent facility that kept<br>
her too much at the mercy of first impressions, she had just sense<br>
enough to know that she wanted leading strings, and thought herself so<br>
much obliged to any who would take the pains to think for her, and<br>
guide her, that with a very little management, she was capable of being<br>
made a most agreeable, nay a most virtuous wife: for vice, it is<br>
probable, had never been her choice, or her fate, if it had not been<br>
for occasion, or example, or had she not depended less upon herself<br>
than upon her circumstances. This presumption her conduct afterwards<br>
verified: for presently meeting with a match, that was ready cut and<br>
dry for her, with a neighbour&rsquo;s son of her own rank, and a young man of<br>
sense and order, who took as the widow of one lost at sea (for so it<br>
seems one of her gallants, whose name she had made free with, really<br>
was), she naturally struck into all the duties of her domestic life,<br>
with as much simplicity of affection, with as much constancy and<br>
regularity, as if she had never swerved from a state of undebauched<br>
innocence from her youth.<br>
<br>
These desertions had, however, now so far thinned Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s cluck<br>
that she was left with only me, like a hen with one chicken; but though<br>
she was earnestly entreated and encouraged to recruit her crops, her<br>
growing infirmities, and, above all, the tortures, of a stubborn hip<br>
gout, which she found would yield to no remedy, determined her to break<br>
up her business, and retire with a decent pittance into the country,<br>
where I promised myself, nothing so sure, as my going down to live with<br>
her, as soon as I had seen a little more of life, and improved my small<br>
matters into a competency that would create in me an independence on<br>
the world: for I was now, thanks to Mrs. Cole, wise enough to keep that<br>
essential in view.<br>
<br>
Thus was I then to lose my faithful preceptress, as did the<br>
philosophers of the town the white crow of her profession. For besides<br>
that she never ransacked her customers, whose tastes too she ever<br>
studiously consulted, she never racked her pupils with unconscionable<br>
extortions, nor ever put their hard earnings, as she called them, under<br>
the contribution of poundage. She was a severe enemy to the seduction<br>
for innocence, and confined her acquisitions solely to those<br>
unfortunate young women, who, having lost it, were but the juster<br>
objects of compassion: among these, indeed, she picked out such as<br>
suited her views and taking them under her protection, rescued them<br>
from the danger of the public sinks of ruin and misery, to place, or<br>
for them, well or ill, in the manner you have seen. Having then settled<br>
her affairs, she set out on her journey, after taking the most tender<br>
leave of me, and at the end of some excellent instructions,<br>
recommending me to myself, with an anxiety perfectly maternal. In<br>
short, she affected me so much, that I was not presently reconciled to<br>
myself for suffering her at any rate to go without me; but fate had, it<br>
seems, otherwise disposed of me.<br>
<br>
I had, on my separation from Mrs. Cole, taken a pleasant convenient<br>
house at Marylebone, but easy to rent and manage from its smallness,<br>
which I furnished neatly and modestly. There, with a reserve of eight<br>
hundred pounds, the fruit of my deference to Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s counsels,<br>
exclusive of clothes, some jewels, and some plate, I saw myself in<br>
purse for a long time, to wait without impatience for what the chapter<br>
of accidents might produce in my favour.<br>
<br>
Here, under the new character of a young gentlewoman whose husband was<br>
gone to sea, I had marked me out such lines of life and conduct, as<br>
leaving me a competent liberty to pursue my views either out of<br>
pleasure or fortune, bounded me nevertheless strictly within the rules<br>
of decency and discretion: a disposition, in which you cannot escape<br>
observing a true pupil of Mrs. Cole.<br>
<br>
I was scarce, however, well warm in my new abode, when going out one<br>
morning pretty early to enjoy the freshness of it, in the pleasing<br>
outlet of the fields, accompanied only by a maid, whom I had newly<br>
hired, as we were carelessly walking among the trees, we were alarmed<br>
with the noise of a violent coughing: turning our heads towards which,<br>
we distinguished a plain well dressed elderly gentleman, who, attacked<br>
with a sudden fit, was so much overcome, as to be forced to give way to<br>
it and sit down at the foot of a tree, where he seemed suffocating with<br>
the severity of it, being perfectly black in the face; not less moved<br>
than frightened with which, I flew on the instant to his relief, and<br>
using the rote of practice I had observed on the like occasion, I<br>
loosened his cravat and clapped him on the back; but whether to any<br>
purpose, or whether the cough had had its course, I know not, but the<br>
fit immediately went off; and now recovered to his speech and legs, he<br>
returned me thanks with as much emphasis as if I had saved his life.<br>
This naturally engaging a conversation, he acquainted me where he<br>
lived, which was at a considerable distance from where I met him, and<br>
where he had strayed insensibly on the same intention of a morning<br>
walk.<br>
<br>
He was, as I afterwards learned in the course of the intimacy which<br>
this little accident gave birth to, an old bachelor, turned of sixty,<br>
but of a fresh vigorous complexion, insomuch that he scarce marked five<br>
and forty, having never racked his constitution by permitting his<br>
desires to over-tax his ability.<br>
<br>
As to his birth and conditions, his parents, honest and failed<br>
mechanics, had, by the best traces he could get of them, left him an<br>
infant orphan on the parish; so that it was from a charity-school,<br>
that, by honesty and industry, he made his way into a merchant&rsquo;s<br>
counting house, from whence, being sent to a house in Cadiz, he there,<br>
by his talents and activity, acquired not only a fortune, but an<br>
immense one, with which he returned to his native country; where he<br>
could not, however, fish out so much as one single relation out of the<br>
obscurity he was born in. Taking then a taste for refinement, and<br>
pleased to enjoy life, like a mistress in the dark, he flowed his days<br>
in all the ease of opulence, without the least parade of it; and,<br>
rather studying the concealment than the shew of a fortune, looked down<br>
on a world he perfectly knew himself, to his wish, unknown and unmarked<br>
by.<br>
<br>
But, as I propose to devote a letter entirely to the pleasure of<br>
retracing to you all the particulars of my acquaintance with this ever,<br>
to me, memorable friend, I shall, in this, transiently touch on no more<br>
than may serve, as mortar, to cement, or form the connection of my<br>
history, and to obviate your surprise that one of my blood and relish<br>
of life, should count a gallant of three score such a catch.<br>
<br>
Referring then to a more explicit narrative, to explain by what<br>
progressions our acquaintance, certainly innocent at first, insensibly<br>
changed nature, and run into unplatonic length, as might well be<br>
expected from one of my condition of life, and above all, from that<br>
principle of electricity that scarce ever fails of producing fire when<br>
the sexes meet. I shall only here acquaint you, that as age had not<br>
subdued his tenderness for our sex, neither had it robbed him of the<br>
power of pleasing, since whatever he wanted in the bewitching charms of<br>
youth, he atoned for, or supplemented with the advantages of<br>
experience, the sweetness of his manners, and above all, his flattering<br>
address in touching the heart, by an application to the understanding.<br>
From him it was I first learned, to any purpose, and not without<br>
infinite pleasure, that I had such a portion of me worth bestowing some<br>
regard on; from him I received my first essential encouragement, and<br>
instructions how to put it in that train of cultivation, which I have<br>
since pushed to the little degree of improvement you see it at; he it<br>
was, who first taught me to be sensible that the pleasures of the mind<br>
were superior to those of the body; at the same time, that they were so<br>
far from obnoxious to, or, incompatible with each other, that, besides<br>
the sweetness in the variety and transition, the one served to exalt<br>
and perfect the taste of the other, to a degree that the senses alone<br>
can never arrive at.<br>
<br>
Himself a rational pleasurist; as being much too wise to be ashamed of<br>
the pleasures of humanity, loved me indeed, but loved me with dignity;<br>
in a mean equally removed from the sourness, of forwardness, by which<br>
age is unpleasingly characterized, and from that childish silly dotage<br>
that so often disgraces it, and which he himself used to turn into<br>
ridicule, and compare to an old goat affecting the frisk of a young<br>
kid.<br>
<br>
In short, every thing that is generally unamiable in his season of<br>
life, was, in him, repaired by so many advantages, that he existed a<br>
proof, manifest at least to me, that it is not out of the power of age<br>
to please, if it lays out to please, and if, making just allowance,<br>
those in that class do not forget, that if must cost them more pains<br>
and attention, than what youth, the natural spring-time of joy, stands<br>
in need of: as fruits out of season require proportionally more skill<br>
and cultivation, to force them.<br>
<br>
With this gentleman, who took me home soon after our acquaintance<br>
commenced, I lived near eight months in which time, my constant<br>
complaisance and docility, my attention to deserve his confidence and<br>
love, and a conduct, in general, devoid of the least art and founded on<br>
my sincere regard and esteem for him, won and attached him so firmly to<br>
me, that, after having generously trusted me with a genteel,<br>
independent settlement, proceeding to heap marks of affection on me, he<br>
appointed me, by an authentic will, his sole heiress and executrix: a<br>
disposition which he did not outlive two months, being taken from me by<br>
a violent cold that he contracted, as he unadvisedly ran to the window,<br>
on an alarm of fire at some streets distant, and stood there<br>
naked-breasted, and exposed to the fatal impressions of a damp night<br>
air.<br>
<br>
After acquitting myself of the duty towards my deceased benefactor, and<br>
paying him a tribute of un-feigned sorrow, which a little time changed<br>
into a most tender, graceful memory of him, which I shall ever retain,<br>
I grew somewhat comforted by the prospect that now opened to me, if not<br>
of happiness, at least of affluence and independence.<br>
<br>
I saw myself then in the full bloom and pride of youth (for I was not<br>
yet nineteen), actually at the head of so large a fortune, as it would<br>
have been even the height of impudence in me to have raised my wishes,<br>
much more my hopes to; and that this unexpected elevation did not turn<br>
my head, I owed to the pains my benefactor had taken to form and<br>
prepare me for it, as I owed his opinion of my management of the vast<br>
possessions he left me, to what he had observed of the prudential<br>
economy I had learned under Mrs. Cole, the reserve of which he saw I<br>
had made, was a proof and encouragement to him.<br>
<br>
But, alas! how easily in the enjoyment of the greatest sweets in life,<br>
in present possession, poisoned by the regret of an absent one! But my<br>
regret was a mighty and just one, since it had my only truly beloved<br>
Charles for its object.<br>
<br>
Given him up I had, indeed, completely, having never once heard from<br>
him since our separation; which, as I found afterwards, had been my<br>
misfortune, and not his neglect, for he wrote me several letters which<br>
had all miscarried; but forgotten him I never had. And amidst all my<br>
personal infidelities, not one had made a pin&rsquo;s point impression on a<br>
heart impenetrable to the true love passion, but for him.<br>
<br>
As soon, however, as I was mistress of this unexpected fortune, I felt<br>
more than ever how dear he was to me, from its insufficiency to make me<br>
happy, whilst he was not to share it with me. My earliest care,<br>
consequently, was to endeavour at getting some account of him; but all<br>
my researches produced me no more light, than that his father had been<br>
dead for some time, not so well as even with the world; and that<br>
Charles had reached his port of destination in the South Seas, where,<br>
finding the estate he was sent to recover, dwindled to a trifle, by the<br>
loss of two ships in which the bulk of his uncle&rsquo;s fortune lay, he was<br>
come away with the small remainder, and might, perhaps, according to<br>
the best advice, in a few months return to England, from whence he had,<br>
at the time of this my inquiry, been absent two years and seven months.<br>
A little eternity in love!<br>
<br>
You cannot conceive with what joy I embraced the hopes thus given me of<br>
seeing the delight of my heart again. But, as the term of months was<br>
assigned it, in order to divert and amuse my impatience for his return,<br>
after settling my affairs with much ease and security, I set out on a<br>
journey for Lancashire, with an equipage suitable to my fortune, and<br>
with a design purely to revisit my place of nativity, for which I could<br>
not help retaining a great tenderness; and might naturally not be sorry<br>
to shew myself there, to the advantage I was now in pass to do, after<br>
the report Esther Davis had spread of my being spirited away to the<br>
plantations; for on no other supposition could she account for the<br>
suppression of myself to her, since her leaving me so abruptly at the<br>
inn. Another favourite intention I had, to look out for my relations,<br>
though I had none but distant ones, and prove a benefactress to them.<br>
Then Mrs. Cole&rsquo;s place of retirement lying in my way, was not amongst<br>
the least of the pleasures I had proposed to myself in this expedition.<br>
<br>
I had taken nobody with me but a discreet decent woman, to figure it as<br>
my companion, besides my servants; and was scarce got into an inn,<br>
about twenty miles from London, where I was to sup and pass the night,<br>
when such a storm of wind and rain come on, as made me congratulate<br>
myself on having got under shelter before it began.<br>
<br>
This had continued a good half an hour, when bethinking me of some<br>
directions to be given to the coachman, I sent for him, not caring that<br>
his shoes should soil the very clean parlour, in which the cloth was<br>
laid, I stept into the hall kitchen, where he was, and where, whilst I<br>
was talking to him, I slantingly observed two horsemen driven in by the<br>
weather, and both wringing wet; one of whom was asking if they could<br>
not be assisted with a change, while their clothes were dried. But,<br>
heavens! who can express what I felt at the sound of a voice, ever<br>
present to my heart, and that it now rebounded at! or when pointing my<br>
eyes towards the person it came from, they confirmed its information,<br>
in spite of so long an absence, and of a dress one would have studied<br>
for a disguise: a horseman&rsquo;s great coat, with a stamp-up cape, and his<br>
hat flapped... but what could escape the alertness of a sense truly<br>
guided by love? A transport then like mine was above all consideration,<br>
or schemes of surprise; and I, that instant, with the rapidity of the<br>
emotions that I felt the spur of, shot into his arms, crying out, as I<br>
threw mine round his neck: &ldquo;My life!... my soul!... my Charles!..&rdquo; and<br>
without further power of speech, swooned away, under the pressing<br>
agitation of joy and surprise.<br>
<br>
Recovered out of my entrancement, I found myself in my charmer&rsquo;s arms,<br>
but in the parlour, surrounded by a crowd which this event had gathered<br>
round us, and which immediately, on a signal from the discreet<br>
landlady, who currently took him for my husband, cleared the room, and<br>
desirably left us alone to the raptures of this reunion; my joy at<br>
which had like to have proved, at the expense of my life, its power<br>
superior to that of grief at our fatal separation.<br>
<br>
The first object then, that my eyes opened on, was their supreme idol,<br>
and my supreme wish, Charles, on one knee, holding me fast by the hand<br>
and gazing on me with a transport of fondness. Observing my recovery,<br>
he attempted to speak, and give vent to his patience of hearing my<br>
voice again, to satisfy him once more that it was I; but the mightiness<br>
and suddenness of the surprise continuing to stun him, choked his<br>
utterance: he could only stammer out a few broken, half-formed,<br>
filtering accents, which my ears greedily drinking in, spelt, and put<br>
together, so as to make out their sense: &ldquo;After so long!... so cruel an<br>
absence!... my dearest Fanny!... can it?... can it be you?...&rdquo; stifling<br>
me at the time with kisses, that, stopping my opening mouth, at once<br>
prevented the answer that he panted for, and increased the delicious<br>
disorder in which all my senses were rapturously lost. However, amidst<br>
this crowd of ideas, and all blissful ones, there obtruded only one<br>
cruel doubt that poisoned nearly all the transcendant happiness: and<br>
what was it, but my dread of its being too excessive to be real? I<br>
trembled now with my fear of its being no more than a dream, and of<br>
waking out of it into the horrors of finding it one. Under this fond<br>
apprehension, imagining I could not make too much of the present<br>
prodigious joy, before it would vanish and leave me in the desert<br>
again, nor verify its reality too strongly, I clung to him, I clasped<br>
him, as if to hinder him from escaping me again: &ldquo;Where have you<br>
been?... how could you... could you leave me?... Say you are still<br>
mine... that you still love me... and thus! thus!&rdquo; (kissing him as if I<br>
would consolidated lips with him) &ldquo;I forgive you... forgive my hard<br>
fortune in favour of this restoration.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
All these interjections breaking from me, in that wildness of<br>
expression that justly passes for eloquence in love, drew from him all<br>
the returns my fond heart could wish or require. Our caresses, our<br>
questions, our answers, for some time observed no order; all crossing,<br>
or interrupting one another in sweet confusion, whilst we exchanged<br>
hearts at our eyes, and renewed the ratifications of a love unabated by<br>
time or absence: not a breath, not a motion, not a gesture on either<br>
side, but what was strongly impressed with it. Our hands, locked in<br>
each other, repeated the most passionate squeezes, so that their fiery<br>
thrill went to the heart again.<br>
<br>
Thus absorbed, and concentered in this unutterable delight, I had not<br>
attended to the sweet author of it being thoroughly wet, and in danger<br>
of catching cold; when, in good time, the landlady, whom the appearance<br>
of my equipage (which, bye the bye Charles knew nothing of) had gained<br>
me an interest in, for me and mine interrupted us by bringing in a<br>
decent shift of linen and clothes; which now, somewhat recovered into a<br>
calmer composure by the coming in of a third person, I pressed him to<br>
take the benefit of, with a tender concern and anxiety that made me<br>
tremble for his health.<br>
<br>
The landlady leaving us again, he proceeded to shift; in the act of<br>
which, though he proceeded with all that modesty which became these<br>
first solemner instants of our re-meeting, after so long an absence, I<br>
could not refrain certain snatches of my eyes, lured by the dazzling<br>
discoveries of his naked skin, that escaped him as he changed his<br>
linen, and which I could not observe the unfaded life and complexion of<br>
without emotions of tenderness and joy, that had himself too purely for<br>
their object, to partake of a loose or mis-timed desire.<br>
<br>
He was soon dressed in these temporary clothes, which neither fitted<br>
him, nor became the light my passion placed him in, to me at least;<br>
yet, as they were on him, they looked extremely well, in virtue of that<br>
magic charm which love put into every thing that he touched, or had<br>
relation to him: and where, indeed, was that dress that a figure like<br>
his would not give grace to? For now, as I eyed him more in detail, I<br>
could not but observe the even favourable alteration which the time of<br>
his absence had produced in his person.<br>
<br>
There were still the requisite lineaments, still the same vivid<br>
vermillion and bloom reigning in his face; but now the roses were more<br>
fully blown; the tan of his travels, and a beard somewhat more<br>
distinguishable, had, at the expense of no more delicacy than what he<br>
could well spare, given it an air of becoming manliness and maturity,<br>
that symmetrized nobly with that air of distinction and empire with<br>
which nature had stamped it, in a rare mixture with the sweetness of<br>
it; still nothing had he lost of that smooth plumpness of flesh, which,<br>
glowing with freshness, blooms florid to the eye, and delicious to the<br>
touch; then his shoulders were grown more square, his shape more<br>
formed, more portly, but still free and airy. In short, his figure<br>
showed riper, greater, and perfecter to the experienced eye, than in<br>
his tender youth; and now he was not much more than two and twenty.<br>
<br>
In this interval, however, I picked out of the broken, often pleasingly<br>
interrupted account of himself, that he was, at that instant, actually<br>
on his road to London, in not a very paramount plight or condition,<br>
having been wrecked on the Irish coast for which he had prematurely<br>
embarked, and lost the little all he had brought with him from the<br>
South Seas: so that he had not till after great shifts and hardships,<br>
in the company of his fellow-traveller, the captain, got so far on his<br>
journey; that so it was (having heard of his father&rsquo;s death and<br>
circumstances,) he had now the world to begin again, on a new account:<br>
a situation, which he assured me, in a vein of sincerity, that flowing<br>
from his heart, penetrated mine, gave him to farther pain, than that he<br>
had not his power to make me as happy as he could wish. My fortune, you<br>
will please to observe, I had not entered upon any overture of,<br>
reserving, to feast myself with the surprise of it to him, in calmer<br>
instants. And, as to my dress, it could give him no idea of the truth,<br>
not only as it was mourning, but likewise in a style of plainness and<br>
simplicity that I had ever kept to with studied art. He pressed me<br>
indeed tenderly to satisfy his ardent curiosity, both with regard to my<br>
past and present state of life, since his being torn away from me: but<br>
I found means to elude his questions, by answers that shewing his<br>
satisfaction at no great distance, won upon him to waive his<br>
impatience, in favour of the thorough confidence he had in my not<br>
delaying it, but for respect I should in good time acquaint him with.<br>
<br>
Charles, however, thus returned to my longing arms, tender, faithful,<br>
and in health, was already a blessing too mighty for my conception: but<br>
Charles in distress!... Charles reduced, and broken down to his naked<br>
personal merit, was such a circumstance, in favour of the sentiments I<br>
had for him, as exceeded my utmost desire; and accordingly I seemed so<br>
visibly charmed, so out of time and measure pleased at his mention of<br>
his ruined fortune, that he could account for it no way, but that the<br>
joy of seeing him again had swallowed up every other sense of concern.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, my woman had taken, all possible care of Charles&rsquo;s<br>
travelling companion; and as supper was coming in, he was introduced to<br>
me, when I received him as became my regard for all of Charles&rsquo;s<br>
acquaintance or friends.<br>
<br>
We four then supped together, in the style of joy, congratulation, and<br>
pleasing disorder that you may guess. For my part, though all these<br>
agitations had left me not the least stomach, but for that uncloying<br>
feast, the sight of my adored youth, I endeavoured to force it, by way<br>
of example for him, who I conjectured must want such a recruit after<br>
riding; and, indeed, he; ate like a traveller, but gazed at, and<br>
addressed me all the time like a lover.<br>
<br>
After the cloth was taken away, and the hour of repose came on, Charles<br>
and I were, without further ceremony, in quality of man and wife, shown<br>
up together to a very handsome apartment, and, all in course, the bed,<br>
they said, the best in the inn.<br>
<br>
And here, Decency, forgive me! if once more I violate thy laws and<br>
keeping the curtains undrawn, sacrifice thee for the last time to that<br>
confidence, without reserve, with which I engaged to recount to you the<br>
most striking circumstances of my youthful disorders.<br>
<br>
As soon, then, as we were in the room together, left to ourselves, the<br>
sight of the bed starving the remembrance of our first joys, and the<br>
thought of my being instantly to share it with the dear possessor of my<br>
virgin heart, moved me so strongly, that it was well I leaned upon him,<br>
or I must have fainted again under the overpowering sweet alarm.<br>
Charles saw into my confusion, and forgot his own, that was scarce<br>
less, to apply himself to the removal of mine.<br>
<br>
But now the true refining passion had regained throughout possession of<br>
me, with all its train of symptoms: a sweet sensibility, a tender<br>
timidity, love-sick yearnings tempered with diffidence and modesty, all<br>
held me in a subjection of soul, incomparably dearer to me than the<br>
liberty of heart which I had been long, too long! the mistress of, in<br>
the course of those grosser gallantries, the consciousness of which now<br>
made me sigh with a virtuous confusion and regret. No real virgin, in<br>
short, in view of the nuptial bed, could give more bashful blushes to<br>
unblemished innocence, than I did to a sense of guilt; and indeed I<br>
loved Charles too truly not to feel severely that I did not deserve<br>
him.<br>
<br>
As I kept hesitating and disconcerted under this soft distraction,<br>
Charles, with a fond impatience, took the pains to undress me; and all<br>
I can remember amidst the nutter and discomposure of my senses, was,<br>
some flattering exclamation of joy and admiration, more specially at<br>
the feel of my breasts, now set at liberty from my stays, and which<br>
panting and rising in tumultous throbs, swelled upon his dear touch,<br>
and gave it the welcome pleasure of finding them well formed, and<br>
un-failed in firmness.<br>
<br>
I was soon laid in bed, and scarce languished an instant for the<br>
darling partner of it, before he was undressed and got between the<br>
sheets, with his arms clasped round me, giving and taking, with gust<br>
inexpressible, a kiss of welcome, that my heart rising to my lips<br>
stamped with its warmest impression, concurring to my bliss, with that<br>
delicate and voluptuous emotion which Charles alone had the secret to<br>
excite, and which constitutes the very life, the essence of pleasure.<br>
<br>
Mean while, two candles lighted on a side-table near us, and a joyous<br>
wood fire, threw a light into the bed, that took from one sense, of<br>
great importance to our joys, all pretext for complaining of its being<br>
shut out of its share of them; and, indeed, the sight of my idolized<br>
youth was alone, from the ardour with which I had wished for it,<br>
without other circumstance, a pleasure to die of.<br>
<br>
But as action was now a necessity to desires so much on edge as ours,<br>
Charles, after a very short prelusive dalliance, lifting up my linen<br>
and his own, laid the broad treasures of his manly chest close to my<br>
bosom, both beating with the tenderest alarms: when now, the sense of<br>
his glowing body, in naked touch with mine, took all power over my<br>
thoughts out of my own disposal, and delivered up every faculty of the<br>
soul to the sensiblest of joys, that affecting me infinitely more with<br>
my distinction of the person, than of the sex, now brought my heart<br>
deliriously into play: my heart, which, eternally constant to Charles,<br>
had never taken any part in my original sacrifices to the calls of<br>
constitution, complaisance, or interest. But ah! what became of me,<br>
when as the powers of solid pleasure thickened upon me, I could not<br>
help feeling the stiff stake that had been adorned with the trophies of<br>
my despoiled virginity, bearing hard and inflexible against one of my<br>
thighs, which I had not yet opened, from a true principle of modesty,<br>
revived by a passion too sincere to suffer any aiming at the false<br>
merit of difficulty, or my putting on an impertinent mock coyness.<br>
<br>
I have, I believe, somewhere before remarked, that feel of that<br>
favourite piece of manhood has, in the very nature of it, something<br>
inimitably pathetic. Nothing can be dearer to the touch, nor can affect<br>
it with a more delirious sensation. Think then! as a love thinks, what<br>
must be the consummate transport of that quickest of our senses, in<br>
their central seat too! when, after so long a deprival, it felt itself<br>
re-inflamed under the pressure of that peculiar sceptre-member, which<br>
commands us all: but especially my darling, elect from the face of the<br>
whole earth. And now, at its mightiest point of stiffness, it felt to<br>
me something so subduing so active, so solid and agreeable, that I know<br>
not what name to give its singular impression: but the sentiment of<br>
consciousness of its belonging to my supremely beloved youth, gave me<br>
so pleasing an agitation, and worked so strongly on my soul, that it<br>
sent all its sensitive spirits to that organ of bliss in me, dedicated<br>
to its reception. There, concentering to a point, like rays in a<br>
burning glass, they glowed, they burnt with the intensest heat; the<br>
springs of pleasure were, in short, wound up to such a pitch, I panted<br>
now with so exquisitely keen an appetite for the eminent enjoyment,<br>
that I was even sick with desire, and unequal to support the<br>
combination of two distinct ideas, that delightfully distracted me: for<br>
all the thought I was capable of, was that I was now in touch, at once,<br>
with the instrument of pleasure, and the great seal of love. Ideas<br>
that, mingling streams, poured such an ocean of intoxicating bliss on a<br>
weak vessel, all too narrow to contain it, that I lay overwhelmed,<br>
absorbed, lost in an abyss of joy, and dying of nothing but immoderate<br>
delight.<br>
<br>
Charles then roused me somewhat out of this ecstatic distraction, with<br>
a complaint softly murmured, amidst a crowd of kisses, at the position,<br>
not so favourable to his desires, in which I received his urgent<br>
insistance for admission, where that insistance was alone so engrossing<br>
a pleasure, that it made me inconsistently suffer a much dearer one to<br>
be kept out; but how sweet to correct such a mistake! My thighs, now<br>
obedient to the intimations of love and nature, gladly disclose, and<br>
with a ready submission, resign up the soft gateway to the entrance of<br>
pleasure: I see, I feel the delicious velvet tip!... he enters me might<br>
and main, with... oh! my pen drops from here in the extasy now present<br>
to my faithful memory! Description too deserts me, and delivers over a<br>
task, above its strength of wing, to the imagination: but it must be an<br>
imagination exalted by such a flame as mine that can do justice to that<br>
sweetest, noblest of all sensations, that hailed and accompanied the<br>
stiff insinuation all the way up, till it was at the end of its<br>
penetration, sending up, through my eyes, the sparks of the love-fire<br>
that ran all over me and blazed in every vein and every pore of me; a<br>
system incarnate of joy all over.<br>
<br>
I had now totally taken in love&rsquo;s true arrow from the point up to the<br>
feather, in that part, where making no new wound, the lips or the<br>
original one of nature, which had owed its first breathing to this dear<br>
instrument, clung, as if sensible of gratitude, in eager suction round<br>
it, whilst all its inwards embraced it tenderly, with a warmth of gust,<br>
a compressive energy, that gave it, in its way, the heartiest welcome<br>
in nature; every fibre there gathering tight round it, and straining<br>
ambitiously to come in for its share of the blissful touch.<br>
<br>
As we were giving them a few moments pause to the the delectations of<br>
the senses, in dwelling with the highest relish on this intimatest<br>
point of re-union, and chewing the cud of enjoyment, the impatience<br>
natural to the pleasure soon drove us into action. Then began the<br>
driving tumult on his side, and the responsive heaves on mine, which<br>
kept me up to him; whilst, as our joys grew too great for utterance,<br>
the organs of our voices, voluptuously intermixing, became organs of<br>
the touch... how delicious!... how poignantly luscious!... And now! now<br>
I felt, to the heart of me! I felt the prodigious keen edge, with which<br>
love, presiding over this act, points the pleasure: love! that may be<br>
styled the Attic salt of enjoyment; and indeed, without it, the joy,<br>
great as it is, is still a vulgar one, whether in a king or a beggar;<br>
for it is, undoubtedly, love alone that refines, ennobles, and exalts<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Thus, happy, then, by the heart, happy by the senses, it was beyond all<br>
power, even of thought, to form the conception of a greater delight<br>
than what I now am consummating the fruition of.<br>
<br>
Charles, whose whole frame was convulsed with the agitation of his<br>
rapture, whilst the tenderest fires trembled in his eyes, all assured<br>
me of a perfect concord of joy, penetrated me so profoundly, touched me<br>
so vitally, took me so much out of my own possession, whilst he seemed<br>
himself so much in mine, that in a delicious enthusiasm, I imagined<br>
such a transfusion of heart and spirit, as that coalescing, and making<br>
one body and soul with him, I was he, and he me.<br>
<br>
But all this pleasure tending, like life from its first instants,<br>
towards its own dissolution, lived too fast not to bring on upon the<br>
spur its delicious moment of mortality; for presently the approach of<br>
the tender agony discovered itself by its usual signals, that were<br>
quickly followed by my dear lover&rsquo;s emanation of himself, that spun<br>
out, and shot, feelingly indeed! up the ravished indraught: where the<br>
sweetly soothing balmy titillation opened all the juices of joy on my<br>
side, which ecstatically in flow helped to allay the prurient glow, and<br>
drowned our pleasure for a while. Soon, however, to be on float again!<br>
for Charles, true to nature&rsquo;s laws, in one breath, expiring and<br>
ejaculating, languished not long in the dissolving trance, but<br>
recovering spirit again, soon gave me to feel that the true mettle<br>
spring! of his instrument of pleasure, were, by love, and perhaps, by a<br>
long vacation, wound up too high to be let down by a single explosion:<br>
his stiffnesss till stood my friend. Resuming then the action afresh,<br>
without dislodging, or giving me the trouble of parting from my sweet<br>
tenant, we played over again the same opera, with the same harmony and<br>
concert: our ardours, like our love, knew no remission; and all the<br>
tide serving my lover, lavish of his stores, and pleasure-milked, he<br>
over-flowed me once more from the fulness of his oval reservoirs of the<br>
genial emulsion: whilst, on my side, a convulsive grasp, in the instant<br>
of my giving down the liquid contribution, rendered me sweetly<br>
subservient at once to the increase of joy, and to its effusions:<br>
moving me so, as to make me exert all those springs of the compressive<br>
exsuction, with which the sensitive mechanism of that part thirstily<br>
draws and drains the nipple of Love; with much such an instinctive<br>
eagerness and attachment, as to compare great with less, kind nature<br>
engages infants at the breasts, by the pleasure they find in the motion<br>
of their little mouths and cheeks, to extract the milky stream prepared<br>
for their nourishment.<br>
<br>
But still there was no end of his vigour: this double discharge had so<br>
far from extinguished his desires, for that time, that it had not even<br>
calmed them; and at his age, desires are power. He was proceeding then<br>
amazingly to push it to a third triumph, still without uncasing, if a<br>
tenderness, natural to true love, had not inspired me with self-denial<br>
enough to spare, and not over-strain him: and accordingly, entreating<br>
him to give himself and me quarter, I obtained, at length, a short<br>
suspension of arms, but not before he had exultingly satisfied me that<br>
he gave out standing.<br>
<br>
The remainder of the night, with what we borrowed upon the day, we<br>
employed with unwearied fervour in celebrating thus the festival of our<br>
remeeting; and got up pretty late in the morning, gay, brisk and alert,<br>
though rest had been a stranger to us: but the pleasures of love had<br>
been to us, what the joy of victory is to an army: repose, refreshment,<br>
every thing.<br>
<br>
The journey into the country being now entirely out of the question,<br>
and orders having been given overnight for turning the horses&rsquo; heads<br>
towards London, we left the inn as soon as we had breakfasted, not<br>
without a liberal distribution of the tokens of my grateful sense of<br>
the happiness I had met with in it.<br>
<br>
Charles and I were in my coach; the captain and my companion in a<br>
chaise hired purposely for them, to leave us the conveniency of a<br>
_t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te_.<br>
<br>
Here, on the road, as the tumult of my senses was tolerably composed, I<br>
had command enough of head to break properly to his the course of life<br>
that the consequences of my separation from him had driven me into:<br>
which, at the same time that he tenderly deplored with me, he was the<br>
less shocked at; as, on reflecting how he had left me circumstances, he<br>
could not be entirely unprepared for it.<br>
<br>
But when I opened the state of my fortune to him, and with that<br>
sincerity which, from me to him, was so much a nature in me, I beged of<br>
him his acceptance of it, on his own terms. I should appear to you<br>
perhaps too partial to my passion, were I to attempt the doing his<br>
delicacy justice, I shall content myself then with assuring you, that<br>
after his flatly refusing the unreserved, unconditional donation that I<br>
long persecuted him in vain to accept, it was at length, in obedience<br>
to his serious commands (for I stood out unaffectedly, till he exerted<br>
the sovereign authority which love had given him over me), that I<br>
yielded my consent to waive the remonstrance I did not fail of making<br>
strongly to him, against his degrading himself, and incurring the<br>
reflection, however unjust, of having, for respects of fortune,<br>
bartered his honour for infamy and prostitution, in making one his<br>
wife, who thought herself too much honoured in being but his mistress.<br>
<br>
The plea of love then over-ruling all objections, for him, which he<br>
could not but read the sincerity of in a heart ever open to him,<br>
obliged me to receive his hand, by which means I was in pass, among<br>
other innumerable blessings, to bestow a legal parentage on those fine<br>
children you have seen by this happiest of matches.<br>
<br>
Thus, at length, I got snug into port, where, in the bosom of virtue, I<br>
gathered the only uncorrupt sweets: where, looking back on the course<br>
of vice I had run, and comparing its infamous blandishments with the<br>
infinitely superior joys of innocence, I could not help pitying, even<br>
in point of taste, those who, immersed in gross sensuality, are<br>
insensible to the so delicate charms of VIRTUE, than which even<br>
PLEASURE has not a greater friend, nor VICE a greater enemy. Thus<br>
temperance makes men lords over those pleasures that intemperance<br>
enslaves them to: the one, parent of health, vigour fertility<br>
cheerfulness, and every other desirable good of life; the other, of<br>
diseases, debility, barrenness, self-loathing, with only every evil<br>
incident to human nature.<br>
<br>
You laugh, perhaps, at this tail-piece of morality, extracted from me<br>
by the force of truth, resulting from compared experiences: you think<br>
it, no doubt, out of character; possibly too you may look on it as the<br>
paultry finesse of one who seeks to mask a devotee to vice under a rag<br>
of a veil, impudently smuggled from the shrine of Virtue: just as if<br>
one was to fancy one&rsquo;s self completely disguised at a masquerade, with<br>
no other change of dress than turning one&rsquo;s shoes into slippers; or, as<br>
if a writer should think to shield a treasonable libel, by concluding<br>
it with a formal prayer for the King. But, independent of my flattering<br>
myself that you have a juster opinion of my sense and sincerity, give<br>
me leave to represent to you, that such a supposition is even more<br>
injurious to Virtue than to me: since, consistently with candour and<br>
good nature, it san have no foundation but in the falsest of fears,<br>
that its pleasures cannot stand in comparison with those of Vice; but<br>
let truth dare to hold it up in its most alluring light: then mark, how<br>
spurious, how low of taste, how comparatively inferior its joys are to<br>
those which Virtue gives sanction to, and whose sentiments are not<br>
above making even a sauce for the senses, but a sauce of the highest<br>
relish; whilst Vices are the harpies that infect and foul the feast.<br>
The paths of Vice are sometimes strewed with roses, but then they are<br>
for ever infamous for many a thorn, for many a cankerworm: those of<br>
Virtue are strewed with roses purely, and those eternally unfading<br>
ones.<br>
<br>
If you do me then justice, you will esteem me perfectly consistent in<br>
the incense I burn to Virtue. If I have painted Vice in all its gayest<br>
colours, if I have decked it with flowers, it has been solely in order<br>
to make the worthier, the solemner sacrifice of it to Virtue.<br>
<br>
You know Mr. C*** O***, you know his estate, his worth, and good sense:<br>
can you, will you pronounce it ill meant, at least of him, when anxious<br>
for his son&rsquo;s morals, with a view to form him to virtue, and inspire<br>
him with a fixed, a rational contempt for vice, he condescended to be<br>
his master of the ceremonies, and led him by the hand through the most<br>
noted bawdy-houses in town, where he took care he should be<br>
familiarized with all those scenes of debauchery, so fit to nauseate a<br>
good taste? The experiment, you will cry, is dangerous. True, on a<br>
fool: but are fools worth so much attention.<br>
<br>
I shall see you soon, and in the mean time think candidly of me, and<br>
believe me ever,<br>
<br>
MADAM,<br>
Yours, etc., etc., etc.<br>
