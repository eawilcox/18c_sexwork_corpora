<br>
 Panting she lay, and fetch'd long double sighs,<br>
 Whilst with thick mists pleasure had dimmed<br>
 her eyes.<br>
<br>
 Some girls have been debauched by<br>
delusive arts, and under promises of mar-<br>
riage, and others have commenced har-<br>
lots through want, but neither of these<br>
motives actuated this lady's principles;<br>
it was mere lewdness that overpowered<br>
all nature's works, and stamped the princi-<br>
ples of conjunction and copulation at a<br>
very early period: Ere twelve summers<br>
had warmed her constitution, she learned<br>
the use of different machines, and felt<br>
the effects of friction as soon as she had<br>
any genial fluid within her. Who first<br>
stamped her virgin mould, we are at a<br>
loss to tell, but from the luxuriance of<br>
the present soil, guess it was broke open<br>
at an early period. She is a very luscious<br>
looking piece, with dark eyes and hair, a<br>
very good complexion, tall, and genteely<br>
formed, with a charming slender leg, and<br>
a pretty foot, which she never troubles<br>
the gentlemen to stoop very low to have<br>
a perfect view of. She is very good na-<br>
tured, sings a good song, and is in bed a<br>
charming companion, particularly at this<br>
season of the year; for she is desirous of<br>
having every part in contact the whole<br>
night. In regard to price, she has one<br>
fixed rule; she always measures a gentle-<br>
man's _may-pole_ by a standard of _nine<br>
inches_, and expects a guinea for every<br>
inch it is short of full measure.</font></span></font></body>
