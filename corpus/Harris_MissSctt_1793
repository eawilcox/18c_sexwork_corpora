Miss Sc\'97tt, No. 44, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square.\
\
'Ads bobs she's wondrous pretty! \
Her looks are almost jetty; \
She's a finer wench than Betty, \
And lo! her eyes are blue!\
\
We cannot call this lady a beauty of the first rate; She is what may \
be determined pretty, but nothing extraordinary, and tho' she cannot \
boast of all those external graces, which distinguish the beauties of \
some ladies; yet I've heard, when she is engaged in her business, \
there are very few who are her superiors. She is amorous to the \
greatest degree, and has courage enough not to be afraid of the \
largest and the strongest man that ever drew weapon in the cause of \
love. She has had a number of admirers in her time, all of which she \
had the satisfaction of pleasing during their temporary residence \
with her. She is now in keeping by one Mr. B\'97, who is not a little \
enamoured of her. Her person is of the middling fine, little black \
eyes, black hair, very fine teeth, and is altogether very agreeable.\
