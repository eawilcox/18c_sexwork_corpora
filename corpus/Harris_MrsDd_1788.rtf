 Street_.<br>
<br>
 ---------------------- O my soul,<br>
 Whither, whither art thou flying,<br>
 Lost in sweet tumultuous dying?<br>
 You tremble love, and so do I!<br>
 Ah! stay, and we'll together dye;<br>
 My soul shall take her flight with thine<br>
 Life dissolving in delight,<br>
 Heaving breasts and swimming sight,<br>
 Faultering speech and gasping breath,<br>
 Symptoms of delicious death;<br>
 My soul is ready for the flight.<br>
<br>
 This lady appeared some years ago, to<br>
our readers, under the name of Ogl--,<br>
but as we have frequently seen, that a<br>
girl, though young, may yet be very<br>
disagreeable, so we may conclude, from<br>
Mrs. D--d, that a woman in years may<br>
be perfectly alluring; she is, indeed,<br>
turned of forty, rather fat and<br>
short, yet she looks well, dresses neat,<br>
and can divide as smartly covered, and<br>
as neat a leg and foot as ever beat time<br>
to _the silent flute_; her temper and be-<br>
haviour are good, and if you are not soon<br>
disposed for the attack, she will shew you<br>
such a set of pictures, that very seldom<br>
fails to alarm the sleeping _member_. Then<br>
may you behold the _lovely fount_ of de-<br>
light, reared on two pillars of monu-<br>
menatal alabaster; the symmetry of its<br>
parts, its _borders_ enriched with _wavering<br>
tendrils_, its _ruby portals_, and the _tufted<br>
grove_, that crowns the summit of the<br>
mount, all join to invite the guest to<br>
enter. The cordial reception he meets<br>
therein, with the tide of _flowing bliss_,<br>
more delicious than the boasted nectar<br>
of the gods, engulph the raptured soul,<br>
and set the lovely owner of the premisses,<br>
above nine tenths of the green gew-<br>
gaws that flutter about the town. If<br>
discipline forms the soldier in the wars<br>
of Mars, experience finishes the female<br>
combatant in the skirmishes of Venus.<br>
That experience this lady has,and is<br>
perfectly skilled in every delightful<br>
manoeuvre, knowing how to keep time,<br>
when to advance and retreat, to face to<br>
the right or left, and when to _shower_<br>
down a whole _volley_ of _love_; so that those<br>
who are vanquished by her glory in their<br>
defeat, pant only for returning vigour to<br>
renew the combat; she is perfectly<br>
mistress in the art of restoring life, and<br>
performs the tender friction with a hand<br>
soft as turtles down. Keeps the house,<br>
and after giving you a whole night's en-<br>
tertainment, is perfectly satisfyed, and<br>
will give you a comfortable cup of tea in<br>
the morning, for one pound one.<br>
