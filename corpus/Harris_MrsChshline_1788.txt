 Street_.<br>
<br>
 Reclin'd upon a couch the maiden lay,<br>
 And all her virgin charms expos'd to view;<br>
 I saw them all, unseen, and in her eyes<br>
 Read the mad language of untaught desire.<br>
<br>
 This Mrs. C------ may say, when<br>
She first seduced this _then_ lovely girl from<br>
the boarding school, and taught her wil-<br>
ling mind the use of that _machine_, her<br>
amorous desires so ardently wished for.--<br>
She is the daughter of a banker in the<br>
city, and might have remained with her<br>
first undoer for many years longer, had<br>
not her itch for _variety_, and the brandy<br>
bottle, got the better of every sub-<br>
servience due to a keeper. Now arrived<br>
at the full age of twenty-six, with fine<br>
sparkling blue eyes, genteel tall figure,<br>
her breasts rather full but not less firm,<br>
very fair, and contrasted beautifully by<br>
the blue branching veins which surround<br>
every part; apparently light brown hair,<br>
but so covered with powder that the colour<br>
is doubtful; of a sprightly and amorous<br>
disposition, and a very warm temper,<br>
especially when _tempered_ by her favorite<br>
liquor, of which she loves to take large<br>
and copious libations, ever desirous of<br>
seeing the bottom. Her price is moderate,<br>
the smallest piece being as much as she<br>
in general expects.</font></span></font></body>
