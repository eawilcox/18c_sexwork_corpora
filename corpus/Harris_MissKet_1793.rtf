<body>Miss Ke&mdash;t, No. 9, Warren-street, Tottenham Court Road.<br>
<br>
Round your neck, like the ivy, <br>
She'll fold her sweet arms, <br>
And wickedly wanton display all her charms; <br>
With transport she'll usher your hand to her breast, <br>
Whilst with her's she applies the tumid bold guest.<br>
<br>
Here the epicures in youth and beauty may satisfy their most ardent <br>
longings. Here Venus seems to have shed her choicest influence; and <br>
Cupid has called forth his choicest arrow of the amorous kind to warm <br>
her little breast to soft enjoyment. 'Tis not a lukewarm flame that <br>
burns in her breast, no, 'tis an enthusiastic rapture which <br>
enlightens her whole soul with the divine spirit of love. Whenever <br>
she is offering incense at the shrine of Venus, her whole frame is <br>
agitated with pleasure, her eyes languish, her breasts heave, and her <br>
limbs quiver; while involuntary sighs and murmurs burst forth from <br>
her tender bosom, provoking the transports of the happy priest who <br>
administers with her. She is about twenty years old, has fine black <br>
eyes and hair, is very genteel, and full of spirits.<br>
