 Fetter Lane_.<br>
<br>
 She darted a sweet kiss,<br>
 The wanton prelude to a farther bliss;<br>
 Such as might kindle frozen appetite,<br>
 And fire e'en wasted nature with delight.<br>
<br>
She is really a fine girl, with a lovely<br>
fair complexion, a most engaging be-<br>
haviour and affable disposition. She<br>
has a most consummate skill in reviving<br>
the dead; for as she loves nothing but<br>
active life, she is happy when she can<br>
restore it: and her tongue has a double<br>
charm, both when speaking and when<br>
silent; for the tip of it, _properly applied_,<br>
can talk eloquently to the heart, whilst<br>
no sound pervades the ear and send such<br>
feelings to the central spot, that imme-<br>
diately demands the more noble weapon<br>
to _close_ the _melting scene_.</font></span></font></body>
