 _Titchfield-Street, Oxford-Street_.<br>
<br>
 'Till haply wandering in the fields of air,<br>
 Some fiend had whisper'd C--sd--l, thou art<br>
 fair.<br>
<br>
We cannot help thinking but this was<br>
the case with our charmer in question;<br>
who, as we have heard, felt her first<br>
desire for the sport from meer inclination;<br>
she is tall and genteely framed, a pretty<br>
innocent looking face, and a pair of<br>
tempting breasts, that nineteen blooming<br>
autumns have brought to full maturity;<br>
a lively blue eye and flaxen hair; a<br>
pretty reserved manner, (excepting when<br>
exhilirated by the chearful glass) which<br>
adds a particular grace to every feature,<br>
and makes her doubly pleasing, fully<br>
verifying Dr. Armstrong,<br>
<br>
 The coyley yielded kiss charms most,<br>
 And gives the most sincere delight;<br>
 Cheapness offends.<br>
<br>
Her temper is sweet, her manners affable,<br>
and her dispofition good. She is remark-<br>
ably fond of dancing, and on that<br>
account frequents most of the public<br>
hops; where she generally picks up her<br>
spark, which is no longer a spark for her,<br>
if he is obliged to change the last guinea<br>
to pay for coach hire.</font></span></font></body>
