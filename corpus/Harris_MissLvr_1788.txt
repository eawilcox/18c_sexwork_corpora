 Queen Ann-Street East_.<br>
<br>
 She darted from her eyes a side long glance<br>
 Just as she spoke, and, like her words, it flew,<br>
 Seem'd not to beg, what yet she bid to do.<br>
<br>
This young nymph of fifteen is<br>
short, of a dark complexion, and inclin-<br>
 able<br>
<br>
 ( 20 )<br>
<br>
able to be lusty; she does not rely on<br>
_chamber practice_ only, for she takes her<br>
evening excursions to seek for _clients_, who<br>
may put their case to her either in a ta-<br>
vern or her own apartments; her fee is<br>
from a crown to half a guinea, and she<br>
strives to earn her money by seeming to<br>
be agreeable; however, she may please<br>
some, and as we have only known her<br>
about four months she cannot have lost<br>
her _appetite_, but seems particularly fond<br>
of the sport.</font></span></font></body>
