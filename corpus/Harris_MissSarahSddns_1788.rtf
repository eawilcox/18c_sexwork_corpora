 dresser's, Tavistock-row, Covent-garden_.<br>
<br>
 He dresses her wig in a new fashion way,<br>
 And black D--m--r as usual is jovial and gay;<br>
 She constantly smiles on her doating dear puff,<br>
 And thinks he can never be tumbled enough.<br>
<br>
 This good-natured piece of luxury<br>
we have nor been able to trace beyond<br>
five years, at which time she made her<br>
entry in no very high sphere, but meet-<br>
ing with great encouragement, she might<br>
have done very well, but love, that<br>
wicked deity, created for the ruin of his<br>
female votaries, shot poor Sally deep in<br>
the heart; going to partake of an<br>
innocent amusement, vulgarly called<br>
_black hops_, where twelve pence will gain<br>
admission, she beheld, oh dire misfortune!<br>
a lovely African, blooming with all the<br>
hue of the warm country that gave him<br>
birth, and fell at that instant a sacrifice<br>
to the charms of the well made sooty<br>
frizeur; for some time she ranked him<br>
amongst her own train, and charitably<br>
exerted herself for his support, but<br>
growing at length satiated with his dear<br>
company, and almost ruined in the bar-<br>
gain, she dismissed the gloomy object of<br>
her late desires, and parted mutual<br>
friends; since which time she has graced<br>
the purlieus of Covent-Garden with her<br>
presence, and is perfectly well known<br>
under the Piazza. She is about twenty-<br>
three, light hair and eyes, a good skin,<br>
and size compleatly adapted for this<br>
season, and which seems to please the<br>
greatest part of her friends and customers,<br>
who think two arms full of joy _twice_ as<br>
good as one; she is remarkably good-<br>
natured and affable to those who favour<br>
her with a visit, and will take almost<br>
any sum rather than turn her visitor<br>
away; but if you absolutely bilk her,<br>
beware of the consequence; for she is<br>
so well convinced that she does not<br>
merit such treatment, that she will, if<br>
possible, revenge the injury; but we hope<br>
none of our friends will ever pay her a<br>
whole noctunal visit without a small<br>
piece of gold in his pocket, as she is an<br>
able pasture maker, is up to every<br>
movement in the art of giving pleasure,<br>
and will oblige them in any way.<br>
