 street, Gray's-Inn-Lane_.<br>
<br>
 Our souls their former joys renew,<br>
 We raise new sport, and wanten jesting;<br>
 Our eyes each others charms review,<br>
 In every form of love contesting.<br>
 At last, our body's warm'd with mutual<br>
 fire,<br>
 To prove each others aid to join in one<br>
 conspire.<br>
<br>
 This truly lovely woman is about<br>
twenty, and, whilst she remains in a<br>
state of silence, commands every attract-<br>
ing charm the heart of man can wish;<br>
she speaks French tolerably well, and<br>
sings inimitably; she has now trod the<br>
path of love four years, during which,<br>
time pretty Emma has experienced every<br>
vicissitude the cruel hand of fortune could<br>
possibly inflict. At present Mr. B. a<br>
merchant, in Castle-Court, is the gen-<br>
tleman from whom she derives her prin-<br>
cipal support; she has fine blue melting<br>
eyes, with an aquiline nose, and a very<br>
pretty mouth, when her tongue is in-<br>
active, but when once she gives a loose<br>
to that unruly member, she pours forth<br>
such a torrent of blackguardism that shall<br>
destroy every attracting feature, and<br>
spoil one of the most desirable looking<br>
girls in the _Cyprian market_. Our damsel<br>
is therefore the most agreeable looking<br>
girl when asleep; in bed she is truly<br>
amorous, and a charming sportswoman,<br>
and when one strain is finished, cries, _da<br>
capo_, with a good grace, for which she<br>
expeas five guineas.</font></span></font></body>
