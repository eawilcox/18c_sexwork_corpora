Mouth Street_.<br>
<br>
 Forbidding me to follow she invites me,<br>
 This is the mould of which I made the sex,<br>
 I gave them but one tongue to say us nay,<br>
 And two kind eyes to grant.<br>
<br>
Here we present our readers with as<br>
pretty a man's woman as ever the<br>
bountiful hand of nature formed; a<br>
pair of black eyes that dart resistless fire,<br>
that speak a language frozen hearts<br>
might thaw, and stand as the sweet index<br>
to the soul; a pair of sweet pouting<br>
lips that demand the burning kiss, and<br>
never receives it without paying with<br>
interest; a complexion that would charm<br>
the eye of an anchorite; a skin smooth'<br>
as monument alabaster, and white as<br>
Alpian snow; and hair that so beauti-<br>
fully contrasts the skin, that nought<br>
but nature can equal. Descend a little<br>
lower and behold the semi-snow-balls.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Studded with role buds, and streaked<br>
 with celestial blue,&quot;<br>
<br>
that want not the support of stays;<br>
whose truly elastic state never suffers the<br>
pressure, however severe, to remain, but<br>
boldly recovers its tempting smoothness.<br>
Next take a view of nature centrally;<br>
no _folding lapel_, no _gaping orifice_, no<br>
_horrid gulph_ is here, but the _loving lips_<br>
tenderly kiss each other, and shelter<br>
from the cold a small but easily stretched<br>
passage, whose _depth_ none but the _blind<br>
boy_ has liberty to _fathom_; between the<br>
_tempting lips_ the _coral headed tip_ stands<br>
centinal, sheltered by a _raven coloured-<br>
bush_, and for one half guinea conduct<br>
the _well erected friend_ safe into _port_.<br>
She is a native of Oxfordshire, and has<br>
been a visitor on the town about one<br>
year, is generally to be met with at home<br>
at every hour excepting ten at night, at<br>
which time she visits a favourite gentle-<br>
man of the Temple.</font></span></font></body>
