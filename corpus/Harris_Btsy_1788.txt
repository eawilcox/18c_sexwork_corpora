 St. James's_.<br>
<br>
 --Endless joys are in that heaven of love,<br>
 A thousand Cupids dance upon her smiles;<br>
 Young bathing graces wanton in her eyes,<br>
 Melt in her looks, and pant upon her breasts;<br>
 Each word is gentle as a western breeze<br>
 That fans the infant bosom of the spring,<br>
 And every sigh more fragrant than the morn.<br>
<br>
 This beautiful girl, that goes by no<br>
other name than Betsy, was formely a<br>
retailer of apples, &amp;c. She has lately,<br>
with three other ladies, sported her figure<br>
at Bath, and was there the reigning toast<br>
amongst the first bucks of the place; she<br>
is delicately and genteely form'd, about<br>
the middle size, very young and spright-<br>
ly, and modest in her conversation, ex-<br>
cept when proper occasions demand wan-<br>
ton freedom; her hair and eyes are black,<br>
and her teeth remarkably white, through<br>
which she plays the velvet tip with un-<br>
common grace and ardour; we cannot<br>
pretend to say who cropt the virgin bud<br>
from the beautiful tree, but it could be<br>
long before she put herself under the care<br>
and direction of Mrs. K----, and under<br>
such a tutoress we have no doubt but she<br>
will be soon such a complete mistress of<br>
her business, that join'd with her personal<br>
accomplishments, will bring her into the<br>
molt elevated life. Many of the post<br>
steeds of Venus have been so often hack'd,<br>
that they are broken winded, halt in<br>
their paces, and are well nigh founder'd,<br>
so as to be scarce fit for any thing but<br>
_brood mares_, if they are not too old.<br>
There will therefore be full room for<br>
Betsy to succeed some of the most eminent,<br>
as she is well worthy of the embraces of<br>
the first men in the kingdom. Some<br>
who have possess'd her speak with rap-<br>
tures of the joy she bestows, they say the<br>
beauties she displays when drest, great<br>
as they are, are trivial to those which cus-<br>
tom keeps concealed; they say the mossy<br>
grot of Venus is perfectly enchanting;<br>
her thighs are two alabaster pillars,<br>
which with the ebon tendril that play in<br>
wanton ringlets round the grot, and<br>
the crimson lining of the elastic portals,<br>
form together that perfect _clare obscure_, so<br>
much admir'd in painting, and which al-<br>
ways produce a most pleasing effect; that<br>
her lovely snowy breasts are quickly be-<br>
spread with purple meandring veins, and<br>
that her murmurs, her broken sighs of<br>
joy, and half spoken words of delight in<br>
the rapturous minute, justify fully, the<br>
exclamation of the poet.<br>
<br>
 Oh! how sweet to see her eyes<br>
 Rolling in their humid fires,<br>
 Where the nymph extended lies<br>
 Full of love and soft desires;<br>
 Conscious red her cheeks o'er spreading,<br>
 And her heaving bosom rising,<br>
 Milky paths to raptures leading,<br>
 Murmuring sighs her joys disguising.</font></span></font></body>
