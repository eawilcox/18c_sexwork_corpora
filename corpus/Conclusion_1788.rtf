<body><font face="Courier"><span style="font-size:13pt"><font color="#000000"> WE must now bid adieu to our cour-<br>
teous reader, and wish him every success<br>
that youth, health, love, and wine can<br>
possibly inspire him with; hoping, at the<br>
same time, that they will throw a friendly<br>
veil over all the unavoidable errors that<br>
may have happen'd in this work, and<br>
excuse that disagreeable tautology, which,<br>
for want of other words, we are necessi-<br>
tated to make, and not to be displeas'd if<br>
they find the same ladies in this list that<br>
appear'd before in other names; for, as<br>
their residence is chang'd as often as their<br>
names, it is almost impossible but some<br>
such mistakes must happen; and hope<br>
that the attention that is now paid to the<br>
procuring the best and most respectable,<br>
will wipe off every other blot.<br>
<br>
 We likewise take leave of the ladies,<br>
and are particularly happy to think that<br>
what was formerly seen in the eyes of<br>
_our_ world a disgrace, is now considered<br>
pleasing, delightful, and honourable.<br>
