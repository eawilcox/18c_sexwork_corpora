 thumberland-street, Strand_.<br>
<br>
 You gaulky steeple, you stalking stag,<br>
 Your husband must come from Brobdignag.<br>
<br>
 It is a pity that so noble a piece could<br>
not be preserved solely for the use of his<br>
Majesty's Grenadiers; she is more than<br>
six foot; she is now about twenty-five,<br>
possesses an elegance in her person, (we<br>
wish we could pay the same compliment<br>
to her actions) light hair and eyes, which<br>
are continually lighted up by the all pow-<br>
erful brandy bottle; as she excells in the<br>
height of stature so is she the height of<br>
good nature, for she never refuses any<br>
gentleman her favors, that has any mo-<br>
ney in his pocket; she is surely too the<br>
height of vulgarity, for she will come<br>
her _eyes and limbs_, with any lady from<br>
Billingsgate, or Jack tar from Wapping;<br>
but her greatest fault, and what makes<br>
more disgusting her other imperfections,<br>
is her violent attachment to drinking;<br>
she generally contrives to pin her basket<br>
completely by nine o'clock; then she<br>
swears most abominably, and is as great<br>
a proficient in barefaced indecency, as<br>
Messalina of antient Rome. We there-<br>
fore set her up as a beacon; in spite of<br>
all, when she pleases, she can be a good<br>
companion, and speaks the English lan-<br>
guage remarkably well; she is never de-<br>
nied to any one, except Mr. G. a watch-<br>
maker, in the city, should be engaged<br>
with her, he being her particular friend.</font></span></font></body>
