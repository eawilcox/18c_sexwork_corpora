 Cavendish-Square_.<br>
<br>
 The blooming looks of spring, and lovely red<br>
 As opening roses, on her cheeks are spread;<br>
 Her eyes that sparkle like the stars above,<br>
 Appear the armory and throne of love,<br>
 Whilst thousands of alluring graces Wait,<br>
 And mingling charms form love's triumphant<br>
 state.<br>
<br>
 This lady is tolerably handsome, with<br>
a fine dark durable complexion, fine<br>
hazel eyes and good teeth, which, by a<br>
perpetual smile, or rather grin, she has<br>
acquired a very convenient knack of<br>
shewing; she is tall, and the goodness of<br>
her temper and disposition render her a<br>
very agreeable companion and makes<br>
her at present much sought after. We<br>
hear the first toast she drinks every day is<br>
to the health of Mr. N----, a gentle-<br>
man of the law, whose name she has<br>
taken the liberty of substituting for her<br>
own; she has not yet been a year on the<br>
town, yet has done great execution<br>
amongst the tender hearts of the men of<br>
the _ton_, many of which she has kindled<br>
into a flame. She is as fond of variety<br>
as any _baronet_'s lady, and will display her<br>
naked beauties to any curious observer,<br>
without giving them the trouble to<br>
mount On any other _man's shoulder_ to take<br>
a peep at them. She is very tall, and<br>
the _pit_ in her black heath is said to have<br>
a considerable profundity, and has baff-<br>
led the art of many a gauger to take it<br>
precisely with the best dipping rules; yet<br>
though the attempt has been unsuccessful,<br>
it hath not been undelightful, for the<br>
passage being straight much pleasure has<br>
been derived by the _gauger_, during which<br>
pleasing pastime<br>
<br>
 A gentle warmth invades her glowing breast,<br>
 And while she fondly gazes on thy face,<br>
 Ev'n thought is lost in exquisite delights;<br>
<br>
and she is so generous, that as she knows<br>
the hours of love are but short, she always<br>
fills up every moment of them with rap-<br>
ture. She well knows how to wind the<br>
_clock_ of nature up to the _highest pitch_, and<br>
make the _human pendulum_ vibrate to ex-<br>
tasy; nay, she can so well fill up what<br>
the Poet calls the _dull pause of joy_, that its<br>
duration is scarce perceiv'd, and she beats<br>
an almost instantaneous alarm to blissful<br>
repetition.</font></span></font></body>
