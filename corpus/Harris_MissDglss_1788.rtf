<br>
 See through the liquid eye, the melting glance,<br>
 The buried soul in lovely tumults lost,<br>
 And all the senses to the _centre sent_.<br>
<br>
She is of the middle size, light hair,<br>
blue eyes, and about twenty-two; she is<br>
a very agreeable companion, fings a<br>
good song, and is a buxom, lively,<br>
luscious bed-fellow, but has nothing re-<br>
markable above the common run of<br>
women of the town, who are young and<br>
handsome; she has been a sportswoman<br>
in the Cyprian Games about five years,<br>
and always expects two pounds two be-<br>
fore she is mounted.</font></span></font></body>
