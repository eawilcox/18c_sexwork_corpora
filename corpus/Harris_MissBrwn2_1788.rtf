 Rathbone Place_.<br>
<br>
 ---------------Sacrifice to her<br>
 The precious hours, nor grudge with such a<br>
 mate<br>
 The summer's day to toy or winter's night.<br>
 Now clasp with dying fondness in your arms<br>
 Her yielding waist, now on her swelling breast<br>
 Recline your cheek, with eager kises press<br>
 Her balmy lips, and drinking from her eyes<br>
 Resistless love, the tender flame confess<br>
 Ineffable, but by the murmuring voice<br>
 Of genuine joy.<br>
<br>
This lively girl is a native of Somerset-<br>
shire, and being thought by her good<br>
parents the rose of the garden, received<br>
an education perhaps beyond what their<br>
circumstances would then admit of, and<br>
pride with innocence danced hand in<br>
hand. From a great desire of becoming<br>
well acquainted with the world she was<br>
apprenticed to a millener of the same<br>
place,<br>
<br>
 Whose parent _hand_ the first _ideas_ form'd.<br>
<br>
Scarce fifteen ripening autumns had<br>
arrived, e'er she felt the divine influence<br>
nature began to inspire her with; the<br>
little fluid nipples till now unnoticed and<br>
almost unseen, began to strut in all the<br>
elegance of infant prime; the heart<br>
began to feel their sovereign power, and<br>
modest nature painted the budding blush<br>
in the centre; nature's sink began no<br>
longer to be thought as such, since now<br>
another fluid passed the narrow bounds,<br>
and instilled, by power instinctive, fresh<br>
feeling into the whole channel, and<br>
every thought and every action seemed<br>
founded on those feelings. It is now<br>
about ten months since she arrived, and<br>
enlisted in the Cyprian choir; she possesses<br>
a delicate fair complexion, with lively<br>
blue eyes, a pretty mouth, and is well<br>
embellished with two rows of polished<br>
ivory; we cannot pretend to stile her a<br>
beauty, but her lively and chearful<br>
disposition, and her accomplishments<br>
under _cover_ in great measure compensate<br>
for the deficiency in her person, and make<br>
one pound one a trifle for a whole night's<br>
possession.</font></span></font></body>
