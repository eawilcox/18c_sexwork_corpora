 Goodge-Street_.<br>
<br>
 To arms, to arms, the Cyprian Queen<br>
 Here braves the god of War,<br>
 And tho' on back, not backward seen<br>
 To take his wond'rous spear,<br>
 And melt it in her _clasping fold_,<br>
 The fold of rapturous burning bliss,<br>
 'Till quite o'erspent in nature's _mould_,<br>
 Then darts fresh vigor with a kiss.<br>
<br>
 If a first rate smart little buck would<br>
wish for a mould to cast light infantry<br>
men in, we would strongly recommend<br>
him to Miss Ch--ld. She has a noble<br>
martial disposition, and would sooner die<br>
than be out rivalled; but independant of<br>
that occurrence in her professional line,<br>
her temper and disposition are good, and<br>
her abilities between the sheets are not<br>
easily equalled, excelled they cannot be;<br>
she possesses a pair of love speaking ceru-<br>
lean eyes, and a bosom as rich with love's<br>
choicest graces as luxuriant fancy can<br>
paint, and filled with the most irresistable<br>
firmness, whose panting redundancy soon<br>
invite the amorous encounter, and calls<br>
into action the till now _hidden friend_,<br>
whose swelling pride and impertinence<br>
will no longer suffer the curtain to remain<br>
drawn. She may, perhaps, at first attempt<br>
to chide, but bolt the door, and then all<br>
chiding ceases; an experienced sofa<br>
then lends its aid; her turning limbs en-<br>
hance the _coming pleasure_, and sighing<br>
kisses crown the _golden minute_; her fair<br>
complexion charms the heart; her wic-<br>
ked blue eyes enchant the soul; her well<br>
made form tempts the touch; her lovely<br>
voice charms the ear, and her glossy flaxen<br>
hair is worth a guinea an hour to look at.<br>
