 East_.<br>
<br>
 Like some fair flower, whose leaves all co-<br>
 lours yield,<br>
 And opening, is with rarest odours fill'd;<br>
 As lofty pines o'ertop the lowly reed,<br>
 So does her graceful height most nymphs ex-<br>
 ceed.<br>
<br>
 Miss S--ms is fair and tall, and if<br>
well paired, would be a very proper<br>
mould to cast grenadiers in; she is about<br>
twenty, and though rather above the<br>
common heighth, is not ungraceful nor<br>
awkward. She knows her value, and<br>
will seldom accept of less than two<br>
guineas, which indeed, are well be-<br>
stowed. It is remarkable, that her lovers<br>
are most commonly of a diminutive size.<br>
The vanity of surmounting such a fine<br>
tall woman, is, doubtless, an incentive to<br>
many, to so unmatch themselves, that<br>
they are content to be like a sweet-bread<br>
on a breast of veal. Yet, notwithstand-<br>
ing her size, we hear her _low countries_<br>
are far from being capacious, but like a<br>
well made boot, is drawn on the _leg_ with<br>
some difficulty, and _fits so close_, as to give<br>
great pleasure to the wearer; it is about<br>
two years since her _boot_ has been ac-<br>
customed to wear legs in it, and though<br>
often _soaled_, (sold) yet never wears out.</font></span></font></body>
