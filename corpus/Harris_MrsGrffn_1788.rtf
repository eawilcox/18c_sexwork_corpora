 Wapping_.<br>
<br>
This is a comely woman, about forty,<br>
and boasts she can give more pleasure<br>
than a dozen raw girls. Indeed she has<br>
acquired great experience, in the course<br>
of twenty years study, in _natural philpsophy_,<br>
in the university of Portsmouth, where<br>
she was long the ornament of the back<br>
of the point. She is perfectly mistress<br>
of all her actions, and can proceed re-<br>
gularly from the dart of her tongue, and<br>
the soft tickle of her hand, to the exta-<br>
tic squeeze of her thighs; the enchanting<br>
twine of her legs; the elaborate suction<br>
of her lower lips, and the melting flood<br>
of delight, with which she constantly<br>
bedews the _mossy root_ of the tree of _life_,<br>
and washes the testimonies of man-<br>
hood; tho' past her meridian, she is<br>
still agreeable; her eyes are black as<br>
well as her hair, of which she has an<br>
abundance both above and below, her<br>
breasts are large but not flabby, and her<br>
skin is fair. Five shillings is her price,<br>
and she earns it with great industry: but<br>
if her lover seems capable of prolonging<br>
the _delicious banquet_, and is remarkably<br>
well provided, she will abate _weight_ for<br>
_inches_. Her chief and best customers<br>
are sea officers, whom she particularly<br>
likes, as they do not stay long at home,<br>
and always return fraught with love and<br>
presents.<br>
