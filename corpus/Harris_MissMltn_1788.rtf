 Covent-Garden_.<br>
<br>
 Here haste ye gay, take pleasure on the wing,<br>
 Taste all her sweets conjoin'd, nor fear her<br>
 sting.<br>
<br>
 This agreeable girl has a pretty face<br>
suffused with a good complexion, dark<br>
penetrating eyes, hair of the same hue,<br>
which waves in glossy ringlets o'er her<br>
shoulders, a set of good teeth, and a<br>
stature of the exact medium between a<br>
giant and a pigmy; she has not been<br>
more than eight months in this grand<br>
mart of universal commerce, and now<br>
stands out for a settlement from some of<br>
her _warm_ admirers, which (being at the<br>
rich age of twenty, the prime of female<br>
charms, when every zeal that can enhance<br>
enjoyments is at its full zenith) she con-<br>
cludes ought to be a good one. Mr.<br>
N--by, a limb of the law, is her greatest<br>
friend and her particular admirer, but<br>
does not seem to have any objection to<br>
her<br>
 &quot;Flying abroad for food,&quot;<br>
<br>
and is not at all displeased to find her a<br>
guinea richer than when he left her.</font></span></font></body>
