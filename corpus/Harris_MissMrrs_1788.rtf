 Street, Oxford Road_.<br>
<br>
 &quot;Methinks I wish, and wish for what I know<br>
 not,<br>
 &quot;But still I wish,--yet, if I had that woman,<br>
 &quot;She I believe could tell me what I wish for.<br>
<br>
 Should the man of pleasure take a<br>
nocturnal ramble _into_ this lady's lodgings,<br>
and be happy enough to find her at home<br>
and alone, he need not wish himself for<br>
that night under the influence of any<br>
other star than that of _Venus_; as she will<br>
very agreeably make the dulest hours to<br>
pass away with the soft music of love,<br>
and beat time to its _silent_ harmony in all<br>
the luxury of soft delight; she is of a<br>
fine brunette complexion, hazel eyes,<br>
which beam inexpressibly sweet, remarka-<br>
ble fine teeth, plump firm bubbies, and<br>
a stately carriage; she dances well, and<br>
is amiable in her temper, lively in her<br>
disposition, and carries good-nature in all<br>
_her actions_; nor does she neglect any<br>
thing in her power to please her visitors.<br>
Her price is from two guineas upwards,<br>
to any sum the gentleman she obliges<br>
thinks she merits; which at the blooming<br>
age of twenty cannot be too much. Had<br>
she less partiality for a certain hair dresser,<br>
we think she would be more pleasing to<br>
the generality of her visitors.<br>
