Mrs. R\'97ad, No. 66, Queen Anne Street East.\
\
With the sports of the field, there's no Pleasure can vie, \
Then follow, follow, &c. the hounds in full cry.\
\
A fine tall girl, about twenty-two, elegant in person, with a \
captivating countenance. She has found out the true art to please and \
be pleased. Mrs. R\'97d has very dark eyes and eye-brows, and plenty of \
the same colour hair on the enchanting spot of love, being a fine \
cover for game. This lady has tasted the sweets of many good things \
in purse and person, and relishes them all. Her predominant passion \
seems for horses, hounds, and the delights of the field. No one is \
more emulous than our heroine, to be in at the death; upon the whole \
we may pronounce this lady a woman of taste and spirit, which she \
displays in nothing more forcibly, hunting not excepted, than in the \
choice of her favourite, as he is still a hunter.\
