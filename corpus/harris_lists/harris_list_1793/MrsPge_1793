Mrs. P\'97ge, No. 26, Upper Newman-street.\
\
Come, thou Goddess, fair and free, \
With the sweet simplicity.\
\
The above two lines are highly descriptive of Mrs. P\'97, who for ease, \
freedom and simplicity is scarcely to be matched among the whole \
sisterhood, besides which, her beauty is by no means inconsiderable. \
She is about twenty, has been near five years in business, and has \
had tolerable fortune; her features are good, except her mouth, which \
is a little too wide, especially when she laughs, which is pretty \
often. Those who are inclined to mirth, will find her to be a good \
companion, without the least tincture of blasphemy, she is not of a \
mercenary disposition, yet she expects one pound one, but rather than \
lose a customer will put up with half the sum.\
