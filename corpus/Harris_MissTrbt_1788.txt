<br>
 The glow of youth, the fire of wanton love,<br>
 Sport in her eye, and rouse the sensual heart<br>
 To strong desires unmanageable pitch.<br>
<br>
So universally known, and so great a<br>
fav'rite with the bucks is this lady, that<br>
her desription is almost needless; her<br>
eyes And hair are of the most inviting<br>
darkness, her temper and disposition<br>
good, and her mind replete with the<br>
choicest gifts of _Minerva_; her figure is<br>
elegant, she is very tall, sings and dances<br>
to perfection, and has only been in a<br>
_public_ way of life twelve months; for a<br>
single skirmish she does not refuse the<br>
King's smallest picture, but for a whole<br>
night's siege expects three of the largest.<br>
