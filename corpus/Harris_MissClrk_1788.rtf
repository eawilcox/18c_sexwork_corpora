<br>
 If any wench Venus's girdle wears,<br>
 Altho' she be ever so ugly,<br>
 Roses and lilys will quickly appear,<br>
 And her face look wond'rous smugly.<br>
<br>
 In some respeCt Miss C---- verifies<br>
this remark of Mr. Gay, for very little<br>
else than her wearing Venus's girdle can<br>
invite any to admire so plain a counte-<br>
nance; she is tall and lusty, with dark<br>
hair and eyes, a very indifferent set of<br>
teeth, and a very flat face; she is now<br>
twenty-five, has followed the trade some<br>
years, and never refuses any sum scarce<br>
that is offered her.</font></span></font></body>
