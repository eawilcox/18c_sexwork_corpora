<br>
 A rose-bud blows in either cheek,<br>
 Round which the lily makes its bed;<br>
 Two dimples sweet good nature speak,<br>
 And auburn ringlets deck her head.<br>
 Her heaving breasts pant keen desire,<br>
 Their blushing summits own the flame;<br>
 Her eyes seem wishing _something nigher_,<br>
 Her hand conducts it to the same.<br>
<br>
 Miss B--nd is a very genteel agreeable<br>
little girl, and is distinguished more by<br>
the elegancy of her dress, than the beauty<br>
of her person, which might perhaps have<br>
been ranked in the list of tolerable's, had<br>
not the small-pox been quite so unkind;<br>
she is, nevertheless, a desirable _well tem-<br>
pered piece_, and one that does not degrade<br>
herself by her company or her actions;<br>
she comes into our corps, in confequence<br>
of her good keeper's leaving England,<br>
and enlists a volunteer, in all the spright-<br>
liness and vivacity of nineteen, with<br>
beautiful auburn hair, and a pair of<br>
pretty languishing blue peepers, that<br>
seem at every glance to tell you how<br>
nature stands affected below; nor will<br>
those swimming luminaries deceive you;<br>
_it_ is ever ready to receive the _well formed<br>
tumid guest_, and as the _external crura_ en-<br>
twine and press _home_ the _vigorous tool_, the<br>
_internal crura_ embrace it, and presses out<br>
the last _precious drops_ of the _vital fluid_,<br>
which her hand, by stealth, conveyed to<br>
the _treasure bags_ of nature, by tender<br>
_squeezings_ seem to increase the undiscrib-<br>
able rapture, at the _dye away moment_; in<br>
short, during her performance of _venereal<br>
rites_, she is all the heart of the most in-<br>
flamed sensualist can wish, or any man<br>
that has two spare guineas in his pocket,<br>
can desire.</font></span></font></body>
