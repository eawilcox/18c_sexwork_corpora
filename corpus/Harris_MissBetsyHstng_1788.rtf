 street, St. James's_.<br>
<br>
 Blest with such charms, the snowy heart could<br>
 move<br>
 Such melting beauties sovereign claims of love;<br>
 She sweetly smiles, unconscious of her pow'r,<br>
 And with her pleasing chat beguiles each hour.<br>
<br>
 It is an undoubted fact she, must<br>
please, she must charm the heart, and<br>
win the foul to exquisite delight; how<br>
can it be otherwise! behold her eyes,<br>
drinking their living moisture in cups of<br>
the purest hazel, and holding converse<br>
with the heart, in such a language, the<br>
least meeting glance must immediately un-<br>
derstand; behold her hair, glossy as the<br>
pearly drops that gild the flow'ry field<br>
when Phoebus first his eastern rays ex-<br>
tends, and soft as turtles down; which,<br>
when suffered to sport in nature's wanton<br>
folds, hold all the graces in their sportive<br>
curls; view next her teeth, as white as<br>
the polish'd elephants, and beautiful as<br>
white;<br>
<br>
 Cheeks from whence the roses seek their<br>
 bloom,<br>
 And lips from whence the zephyrs steal perfume<br>
<br>
but all these charms united, fall very<br>
short of her mental qualifications: her<br>
lively wit charms the heart, and makes<br>
her the desirable companion; her beha-<br>
viour, Which in company never deviates<br>
from the strict line of modesty, gains her<br>
the truest merit: her apartments are very<br>
genteel, and her dress corresponds with<br>
her person. Her professional abilities<br>
are not less to be priz'd than her other na-<br>
tural gifts; her natural structure in those<br>
parts is so well adapted, that it must<br>
please; and every additional improvement<br>
to enhance the coming pleasure our deli-<br>
cate charmer is well acquainted with;<br>
being now only nineteen she cannot, in<br>
the least, have lost the keen edge of amo-<br>
rous transport; neither are the essential<br>
parts at all deprived of their magical<br>
power; the liquid eye streams with the<br>
maddening fire of youth, with all the<br>
desires of unsatiated love; the panting<br>
heave, accompanying the quick inter-<br>
rupted sigh, speaks desire in its fullest<br>
tone; and so mutually does she inter-<br>
change the liquid store at the die-away<br>
convulsive moment, that all her soul seems<br>
centred in the blissful spot. She is tall,<br>
and elegantly form'd in every limb;<br>
Mr. Arch--r, the musician, is at present<br>
her favourite man; him she will oblige<br>
at any time, from every one else she<br>
expects three guineas.</font></span></font></body>
