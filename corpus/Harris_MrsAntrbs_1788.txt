 Leicester-Fields_.<br>
<br>
 ---------What woman, when<br>
 Her blood boils up, and wantons in her veins,<br>
 When her hot panting pulse beats to the joy;<br>
 What woman then would quench her generous<br>
 flame<br>
 in an inactive tedious husband's arms,<br>
 That fires and jades our expectation<br>
 In the first stretch of love; then duly falls<br>
 To his old trot, and drudges out the course?<br>
<br>
 Altho' we cannot assert that this lady<br>
is actually married, we can with truth<br>
venture to affirm there are many that<br>
have entered the matrimonial circle,<br>
that does not possess the same degree of<br>
constancy for their husbands, as this<br>
lady does for her generous keeper. He<br>
is to be sure an Hibernian gentleman<br>
and a captain, two powerful inducements,<br>
or rather compellers, to her keeping<br>
within bounds; the first being generally<br>
passionate and cruel when irritated, and<br>
the profession of the latter is, we must<br>
imagine, a powerful bar. But still she is<br>
not impregnable, and where a gentle-<br>
man (for that he must be) possesses the<br>
proper means, there is not much doubt<br>
of his success; flattery is a bait that few<br>
females can withstand, let every word<br>
and action be well cloathed in her<br>
richest garb; this incense must be of-<br>
fer'd at the shrine with pains, perseverance,<br>
honour, secrecy, and liberality join-<br>
ed with it, and when she is thoroughly<br>
convinced that you possess all these re-<br>
quisites, she will unfold her _haven_ of<br>
delight, and put you in possession of<br>
such charms that would not disgrace a<br>
monarch's couch; her tell-tale lascivious<br>
eye acts as a charming index to that un-<br>
quenchable flame that fills the whole<br>
frame, and swallows up the other senses;<br>
she is rather short, but admirably well<br>
made, and when once convinced of the<br>
_honour_ and parts of her paramour, gives<br>
such a loose to her unbounded appetite,<br>
that very few of the Cyprian choir can<br>
match her.</font></span></font></body>
