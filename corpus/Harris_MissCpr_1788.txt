 Court_.<br>
<br>
 Let me press therein my arms,<br>
 Tune of my heart, and charmer of my eyes,<br>
 Nay, thou shall hear the extacy from me,<br>
 I'll make thee smile with my extravagant passion.<br>
<br>
This lady is neither handsome, well<br>
dress'd, well lodg'd, nor well bred; yet<br>
she will give more delight than most of<br>
the finical dames, who think they do<br>
their gallants a favour to admit their em-<br>
braces at a high price. This humble girl<br>
is thankful for a crown, and will testify<br>
her gratitude in whatever way you chuse,<br>
she is willing to appear in the dress of<br>
_pure nature_, as her skin is without spot<br>
or blemish, her breasts small and plump,<br>
and her limbs well turned and well pro-<br>
portioned. It is her joy to give joy, and<br>
she omits no means of procuring it;<br>
though her compliance is ample, she is<br>
so reserved in her demand that she takes<br>
what is given, and does not, like too<br>
many of her sisterhood, seize the minute<br>
just preceding the moment of extacy to<br>
demand more, and either proceed or<br>
draw back as her demands are gratify'd or<br>
not. In short she is worthy of some de-<br>
gree of elevation, to enable her to walk<br>
a more gainful round than Catherine-<br>
street, or the Strand. She has lately been<br>
to visit her parents in Derbyshire, and is<br>
now returned a tolerable fresh piece<br>
again.</font></span></font></body>
