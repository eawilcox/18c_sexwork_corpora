 _phen Street, Rathbone Place_.<br>
<br>
 Oh! the transporting joy!<br>
<br>
 Impetuous flood of long-expected rap-<br>
ture, she is a charming black beauty;<br>
her vivid eyes, speak the liveliness of her<br>
disposition, and the joy she conceives in<br>
the hour of bliss. As yet she hath not ap-<br>
proached the verge of satiety; she is not<br>
so hackneyed in the ways of man as to be<br>
merely passive, she enjoys the pleasure,<br>
and though she is very fond of a _noun<br>
substantive_ that can _stand_ by itself, yet she<br>
loves to make it _fall_, and indeed the<br>
stoutest man cannot _stand_ long before<br>
her; many a _fine weapon_ she has made<br>
a _mere hanger_ and the most stubborn steel<br>
hath melted in her _sheath_; yet no one<br>
complains, but rather rejoices at the de-<br>
bility she produces, and wishes for repe-<br>
tition which she enjoys with a _gou_ peculiar<br>
to herself, and is possessed of every _amo-<br>
rous_ means to produce it, as she is of<br>
every luscious one to destroy it.--To be<br>
met with at any of the genteel houses<br>
about St. James's.<br>
