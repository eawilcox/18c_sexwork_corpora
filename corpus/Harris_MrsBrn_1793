Miss Bro\'97n, No. 4, Princess-street, Cavendish square.\
\
Say lovely youth would'st thou thus betray, \
My easy faith and lead my heart astray.\
\
The situation of this lady is truly pitiable, for as we understand, \
her heart was betrayed by a young gentleman in the country, who soon \
forsook her, which she repeats with a good deal of apparent grief, \
and does not seem at all calculated for her present way of life, \
except in point of beauty. Is rather short, and has a clear fair \
skin, with a pleasing blue eye, her cheeks are very prettily dimpled, \
and she has a natural fresh colour, her hair is bright, and her teeth \
are good. She is now a lovely desirable girl, but if she continues \
long in her present situation, it is a great chance but that the \
becomes as false, inconstant and infamous as many others of the \
fraternity. By this remark we do not mean to anticipate any \
disagreeable circumstances, but mention it merely to her as a \
friendly caution that may possibly raise her pride and guard her \
against those baneful habits which are so often the disgrace and \
sometimes the ruin of many of the sex.\
