<body>Miss Bro&mdash;n, No. 4, Princess-street, Cavendish square.<br>
<br>
Say lovely youth would'st thou thus betray, <br>
My easy faith and lead my heart astray.<br>
<br>
The situation of this lady is truly pitiable, for as we understand, <br>
her heart was betrayed by a young gentleman in the country, who soon <br>
forsook her, which she repeats with a good deal of apparent grief, <br>
and does not seem at all calculated for her present way of life, <br>
except in point of beauty. Is rather short, and has a clear fair <br>
skin, with a pleasing blue eye, her cheeks are very prettily dimpled, <br>
and she has a natural fresh colour, her hair is bright, and her teeth <br>
are good. She is now a lovely desirable girl, but if she continues <br>
long in her present situation, it is a great chance but that the <br>
becomes as false, inconstant and infamous as many others of the <br>
fraternity. By this remark we do not mean to anticipate any <br>
disagreeable circumstances, but mention it merely to her as a <br>
friendly caution that may possibly raise her pride and guard her <br>
against those baneful habits which are so often the disgrace and <br>
sometimes the ruin of many of the sex.</body>
