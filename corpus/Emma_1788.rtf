Emma, _at Mother Gray's, No. 30,\
  Market-Lane, near the Opera House_.\
\
        In the middle of me,\
        You plainly may see,\
   A thing that will suit every man;\
        And when you are in it,\
        The critical minute,\
   Ensure as fast as you can.\
\
A young tit of Mother Gr--y's own\
procuring, and that our reader should\
not mistake the old abbess, we will give\
a short description of her. If you chance\
to visit her in the morning, the smell of\
yellow usquebaugh will salute your nos-\
trils, of which she takes copious draughts\
before breakfast. In all her actions she\
shews the lewdness of a monkey, and\
the letchery of a goat; she has lately\
been _fired_ by P----, the French fri-\
zeur, but knowing the use of murcury,\
she applied it in such a manner that she\
procured an effectual salivation, and\
enabled her to take into her house the\
fame squinting gentleman that present\
acts as her _fine man_; she boasts of her\
knowledge of great men, and there is\
scarce a lord or duke in the land that\
has not been her _cull_.\
We can but pity our little girl in\
question for being so unhappily situated;\
she is a charming sprightly lass, and so\
fond of kissing, and so perfect a mistress\
in the art, that she will frequently force\
nature to a dissolving pitch, before the\
_right parts_ come in proper contract; her\
liveliness of disposition, and activity in\
the sports of Venus, make her so desi-\
rable a bed-fellow, that her magic _ring_\
is as much sought after as the philoso-\
pher's stone; has good hair and teeth, a\
plump round, firm breast, and confined\
merely as an object to sensual desire, pos-\
sesses every qualification a sensualift can\
desire. She is to be met with every\
night at Sterling's, and being newly come\
on to the town, and possessing too much\
innocence, as well as ignorance, to fight\
the world as she ought, she is frequently\
bilked; but this there is no doubt she\
will soon get the better off, particularly\
if she follows the precepts and advice of\
the old lady she lives with.}
