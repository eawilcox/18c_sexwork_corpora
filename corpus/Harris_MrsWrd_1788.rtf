 Middlesex Hospital_.<br>
<br>
 There is a joy to melt in her embrace,<br>
 Dissolve in pleasures, not in delights.<br>
<br>
 She is a fine lusty well looking lady;<br>
her eyes and hair are dark; her teeth<br>
good, and her age about thirty; she sees<br>
much company, and none depart unsatis-<br>
fied, it being her study to please, and her<br>
pride to be thought worthy of a second<br>
visit. She is very careful of her health,<br>
and where she has the least reason to<br>
suspect infection, is very strict in examin-<br>
ing the ambassador of love e'er she re-<br>
ceives his tribute. Tho' a very generous<br>
dealer, and one who has dealt in our<br>
market at least ten years, she does not<br>
appear to be quite void of sensibility;<br>
but seems to give pleasing proofs that she<br>
feels delight, as well as bestows it. Her<br>
old friend, whose name she stole, has<br>
been long dead, and by his death has<br>
reduced her to accept of almost any sum<br>
her paramour offers.</font></span></font></body>
