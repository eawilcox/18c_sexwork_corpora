Hotel, opposite Virginia Street, Wapping_.<br>
<br>
 For lips to lips, and Tongue to Tongue,<br>
 Will make a man of sixty young.<br>
<br>
Yes, 'tis Harriet, the fair, still<br>
blooming Harriet, whose eyes are<br>
molded for the tender union of souls (let<br>
them but borrow a little fire from<br>
Bacchus) &quot;by Heaven's, shoot Suns&quot;<br>
whose nectar-distilling lips pour sweetest<br>
balm; whilst the soft silent lingual inter-<br>
course shoots powerfully through all the<br>
frame, and awakes each dormant sense.<br>
When naked she is certainly Thomson's<br>
Lavinia.<br>
<br>
 For loveliness,<br>
 Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,<br>
 But is, when unadorned, adorned the most.<br>
<br>
A beautiful black fringe borders the<br>
_Venetian Mount_, and whether she pursues<br>
the _Grahamatic_ method from a practical<br>
knowledge of its increase of pleasure,<br>
from motives of cleanliness, or as a cer-<br>
tain preventative we will not pretend to<br>
say; but we well know it makes her the<br>
more desirable bed-fellow, and after<br>
every _stroke_ gives fresh _tone and vigour_ to<br>
the lately _distended parts_; her legs and<br>
feet claim her peculiar attention, nor do<br>
their _coverings_ ever disgrace their owner,<br>
nor their actions under _cover_ ever do<br>
injustice to that dear delightful spot they<br>
are doomed to support, protect, and pay<br>
just obedience to; _the eager twine_, the<br>
almost unbearable press at the _dye away<br>
moment_, with all _love's_ lesser _Artillery_, she<br>
plays off with uncommon activity and<br>
ardor, and drinks _repetition_ with thirst<br>
insatiable. Half a guinea, and a new<br>
pink ribband to encircle her bewitching<br>
brows, is the least she expects for a night's<br>
entertainment. There are three or four<br>
more ladies of _our_ order in the house, if<br>
this lady should not exactly suit.<br>
<br>
 But being blest with beauty's potent spell,<br>
 Must from her other sisters bear the bell.</font></span></font></body>
