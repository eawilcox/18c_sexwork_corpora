Miss W--ll--ms, No. 3, _Glanville-\
             street_.\
\
   Firm breasts, white belly, and such thighs,\
   Gaze ghastly envy, and forget her size.\
\
   This lady's affable temper, and en-\
gaging disposition, fully compensates\
for her size, which is rather diminutive,\
and the innumerable beauties of	her face,\
when put in competition with this defi-\
ciency, ought entirely to efface the small-\
est idea of it. From her youth we might\
be led to imagine her deficient in the\
practice of love, but we can assure our\
readers he will meet but few in the _cy-\
prian field_ that will shew better sport;\
her hair is a beautiful glossy dark brown;\
her eye brows finely arc'd, and of the\
same hue, which, contrasted by a pair of\
beautiful cerulean eyes, and cheeks of\
living roses and lilies, places her in the\
rank of first rate beauties,\
\
   Her rising breasts two hillocks are of snow,\
   On which two little fragrant rose buds grow;\
\
below which descends the smooth track\
of a belly, which conveys to the mind an\
idea of animated ivory, at the bottom\
of which is display'd a lovely chesnut\
fringe, terminated by a pouting _slash hole_,\
which is far from being insensible to the\
raptures of its _grisly antagonist_, and with\
pleasure _opens_ its _mouth_ to receive his well\
erected crest, who _enters_ with his accus-\
tomed pride, but soon returns with _fal-\
len head_, as if conscious of its presumption;\
but the _mistress_ of this formidable _enemy_\
is well acquainted with the means of re-\
storing life to the _vanquished memmber_, but\
only to make it more sensible of its ina-\
bility. Mercenary views are far from\
what she aims at; she can give and\
receive a _luscious_ share of pleasures\
of _copulation_; but beginning to know the\
accustom'd ways of the baser sort of\
men, and not being always confident of\
the honour of her _paramour_, if he is a\
stranger, she must receive her compli-\
ment of half a guinea, or a guinea, ac-\
cording to the length of the intended\
visit, before she proceeds to any kind of\
business.\
