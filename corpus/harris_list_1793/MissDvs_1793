Miss D-vis, No. 22, Upper Newman-street.\
\
Artful ways beguile the implicit rake.\
\
THIS is a fine lively girl, about twenty-one, rather above the middle \
size, genteely made; has several good friends, but is much attached \
to young Br-om, the lottery-office-keeper, who is now in prison, \
where she often visits him; is ever obliging, and seldom out of \
humour, understands a great deal of her business, and never fails to \
please. She enjoys her favourite man with ecstasy; and pleases, with \
cold indifference, managed by art, the rest of her votaries; who are \
content with thinking they have fathomed the deepest part of a girl \
so replete with sensation; in short, she can so well counterfeit the \
passions of love and lust, that many of the most knowing rakes of the \
town would be easily deceived. This lady occupies the parlour.\
