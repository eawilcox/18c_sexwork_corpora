 _Lisle Street, Leicester Fields_.<br>
<br>
 My heart's so full of joy,<br>
 That I could do some wild extravagance<br>
 Of love in public, and the foolish world,<br>
 That knows not tenderness, might think<br>
 me mad.<br>
<br>
 This lady is fair, of a good size, very<br>
chatty, fond of obliging, and far from<br>
being mercenary: the more agreeable<br>
her man, the less of money she expects<br>
or demands. It is true, she has other<br>
customers that make up for what she<br>
may loose by her attachments to plea-<br>
sure; so that between the one and the<br>
other, she is very well off, and we pro-<br>
phesy will be long in vogue; we have<br>
known her only six months, and have<br>
reason to think very few has known her<br>
longer.</font></span></font></body>
