 Leicester Fields_.<br>
<br>
 Why should they e'er give me pain,<br>
 Who to give me joy disdain;<br>
 All I ask of mortal man,<br>
 Is to---------me whilst he can.<br>
<br>
These four lines were not more appli-<br>
cable to Miss C--tl--y, than to this pre-<br>
sent reigning lover of the sport; she is<br>
rather above mediocrity in height and<br>
size, with fine dark hair, and a pair of<br>
bewitching hazel eyes; very agreeable<br>
and loving, but she is not so unreasonable<br>
as to expect constancy; it is a weak un-<br>
profitable quality in a woman, and if she<br>
can persuade her husband or keeper that<br>
she has it, it is just the same as though<br>
she really possessed it. Miss B--lt--n<br>
is conscious she loves variety, as it con-<br>
duces both to her pleasure and interest;<br>
and she gives each of her gallants the<br>
same liberty of conscience, therefore she<br>
never lessens the fill of joy, by any real<br>
or affected freaks of jealousy; when her<br>
lovers come to her, they are welcome,<br>
and they are equally so when they fly to<br>
another's arms. Indeed, when they do<br>
so, it is generally to her advantage, as<br>
she finds they return to her with re-<br>
doubled ardour, and her charms are in<br>
general more dear, from a comparison<br>
with others; and although her age is<br>
bordering upon twenty-four, and she has<br>
been a traveller in our path four years,<br>
her desires are not the least abated, nor<br>
does she set less value on herself.</font></span></font></body>
