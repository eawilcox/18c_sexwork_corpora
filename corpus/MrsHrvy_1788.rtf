 Street East_.<br>
<br>
 Behold those eyes that swim in humid fires,<br>
 And trace her wanton thoughts and young<br>
 desires;<br>
 Taste those sweet lips, with balmy Nectar<br>
 fraught,<br>
 And all the rich luxuriancy of thought:<br>
 Press her soft bosom--seat of swelling joy,<br>
 Whose charms invite the rosy pinion'd boy;<br>
 Who, fluttering here, may point the unerring<br>
 dart,<br>
 Flash in each eye, and revel in each heart,<br>
 Till bolder grown, your hand insatiate rove,<br>
 O'er her delightful _mount_ and _sportive grove_;<br>
 Then all her limbs unbound, her girdle loose,<br>
 There's nothing you can ask her, she'll refuse.<br>
<br>
 The above lines, from one of the<br>
warmest and most elegant poets fancy<br>
ever favoured, might be very justly ap-<br>
plied to this charming girl. Rich with<br>
the glow of youth, and the charms of a<br>
person, in which nature has been lavishly<br>
bountiful, she possesses a mind rarely,<br>
very rarely met with in the frail<br>
daughters of pleasure; generous, free-<br>
hearted, noble, feeling, and disinterested,<br>
might appear to be too high sounding<br>
epithets for a woman of this dercription.<br>
But however strange, it is not less strange<br>
than true; for she possesses qualities,<br>
which the want of, might make many a<br>
titled dame, poessessed of that single virtue,<br>
(or at least appearing to possess it) that<br>
she has unfortunately lost,--blush, for<br>
they may all with the strictest truth be<br>
applied to her. Here then, may the<br>
man come, (nay, we advise him to) who<br>
wishes in the morning, succeedimg a de-<br>
licious night, to find his person and his<br>
purse safe, and his health uninjured;<br>
here may he come, and taste every joy<br>
the most luscious desire can wish; here<br>
may his very sense be fed, nor know<br>
satiety, for joined to a beautiful face, an<br>
elegant form, and a graceful manner,<br>
you win find the agreeable companion,<br>
the good humoured girl, and the most<br>
enchanting bedfellow; young, and not<br>
more than three months _on_ the town, or<br>
_in_ the town, fine hazel love-swimming<br>
eyes, and dark brown hair, which left to<br>
twine in nature's wanton folds, plays<br>
loosely over a neck white as snow un-<br>
sunned, and sweetly shades the most en-<br>
chanting _love hillocks_ nature ever planted<br>
_below_, a jetty _black_ surrounds the _pouting<br>
mansion_, rais'd on a pair of pillars that<br>
might _shame_ the _whitest_, or mark the<br>
smoothest alabaster, that twine in the<br>
amorous encounter, and seem to partake<br>
of that pleasure in the dye-away moment,<br>
that we cannot pretend to set any value<br>
upon.</font></span></font></body>
