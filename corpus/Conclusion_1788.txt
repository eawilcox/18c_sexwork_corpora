WE must now bid adieu to our cour-
teous reader, and wish him every success
that youth, health, love, and wine can
possibly inspire him with; hoping, at the
same time, that they will throw a friendly
veil over all the unavoidable errors that
may have happen'd in this work, and
excuse that disagreeable tautology, which,
for want of other words, we are necessi-
tated to make, and not to be displeas'd if
they find the same ladies in this list that
appear'd before in other names; for, as
their residence is chang'd as often as their
names, it is almost impossible but some
such mistakes must happen; and hope
that the attention that is now paid to the
procuring the best and most respectable,
will wipe off every other blot.

 We likewise take leave of the ladies,
and are particularly happy to think that
what was formerly seen in the eyes of
_our_ world a disgrace, is now considered
pleasing, delightful, and honourable.
