<br>
 When will the dear man come, that I may<br>
 hold him<br>
 Fast as my love can make him, hug him close<br>
 As my fond soul can wish; give all my breath<br>
 In sighs and kisses, tell I swoon with rapture.<br>
<br>
 All this she seems to say to each<br>
admirer; it cannot be true to all. But<br>
no matter. Vanity whispers to each,<br>
_this is for thee alone_, and the self-deceived<br>
dolt believes it. Miss S--tt--n, indeed,<br>
can give pleasure; her agreeable per-<br>
son, animated eyes, and lively manner,<br>
promise pleasing enjoyment, and in that<br>
she does not deceive; she artfully prolongs<br>
the pleasure to its utmost limits, and even<br>
then repines it is so short. She is of a<br>
comfortable size, genteelly form'd, with a<br>
pretty round face, a little pimpled, very<br>
pretty orient teeth, and now just entered<br>
her twenty-second year; her lodgings are<br>
neat and elegant, for the use of which,<br>
and a little _black apartment_, she always<br>
carries about her; she expects, at least 3<br>
guineas; if not at home, in the evening,<br>
is generally to be met with in the green<br>
boxes.</font></span></font></body>
