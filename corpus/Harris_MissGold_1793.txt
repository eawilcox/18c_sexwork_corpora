<body>Miss Go-ld, No. 61, Well-street.Every woman has not the same talents to please alike, yet, all have <br>
some peculiar to themselves; the one sings, another dances with a <br>
peculiar grace. One charms by her sense and sensibility; another <br>
catches the heart by mere simplicity. Miss Go&mdash;ld's particular <br>
advantage is a surprising fond humour which she displays in the most <br>
agreeable manner imaginable. A mistress of such a turn, must sure be <br>
very desirable, as nothing in the world can please equal to good <br>
humour, joined with beauty. This lady lives in very gay life, and <br>
receives visits only from the best, of whom she makes whatever she <br>
thinks proper, by help of her agreeable talent. She is but slim made, <br>
is not above twenty years old, has fine dark brown glossy hair and <br>
eyes.</body>
