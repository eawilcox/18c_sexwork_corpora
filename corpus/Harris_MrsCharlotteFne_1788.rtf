 Street, Soho_.<br>
<br>
 To tell the beautie's of the place,<br>
 How weak is human tongue;<br>
 The noble fringes which it grace,<br>
 In golden ringlets hung.<br>
<br>
 Charlotte received a good education,<br>
and was once far above the perambu-<br>
lating class of nymphs, and might, per-<br>
haps, have remained so, had not her<br>
violent attachment to the curs'd buckle<br>
and belt society, rendered her disgusting<br>
in the eyes of all her friends; Mr.<br>
G--bl--t, brother to a tallow chandler,<br>
of Carnaby-Market, took particular no-<br>
tice of her, and removed her once from<br>
her hated crew, allowed her a tolerable<br>
provision, and would have continued<br>
her friend, had not her rage for the old<br>
society made him forfeit his esteem. She<br>
is now rather in the wane, having seen<br>
at least twenty-eight summers, tall, and<br>
very well proportioned; her complexion<br>
is but indifferent, but, being a native of<br>
Germany, is not to be wondered at; she<br>
speaks French also, but we cannot get<br>
her to confess she has been ten years on<br>
the town, unless you pay her a _guinea fee_<br>
for confessing.<br>
