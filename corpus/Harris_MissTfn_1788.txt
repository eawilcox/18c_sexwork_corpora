<br>
 Had love's fair goddess been so strong in charms,<br>
 Rash Diomede had dropt his vent'rous arms;<br>
 No shameful victory the Greek had won,<br>
 But had a thousand wounds receiv'd instead of<br>
 giving one.<br>
<br>
 This tit bit is not above sixteen, ra-<br>
ther short; but pretty, having an excel-<br>
lent complexion, with fine blue eyes,<br>
light hair, and a very white, and regular<br>
set of teeth. Altho' she has not been six<br>
months upon the _Pave de Londres_, (hav-<br>
ing received a complete education, has<br>
learnt to dance, speak French, and play<br>
upon the guittar; and has likewise been<br>
initiated into all the mysteries of the<br>
Cyprian school; having read _les Bejoux<br>
Indiscrets_; the _Woman of Pleasure_; Ro-<br>
chester's Poems;) she is _au fait de tout_.<br>
Add to this, she has often viewed with<br>
rapture all _Aretin's_ postures, and longed<br>
for the practice, as well as the theory.<br>
No wonder then that she should be in-<br>
clined to give delight in every possible<br>
attitude, and has no kind of objection to<br>
yield, with becoming modesty, to take<br>
a _coup_ a la _levrette_. She is at present in<br>
keeping by a citizen, who has suffered<br>
her to assume his name, but is always<br>
pleased when Mr. T. is not with her, to<br>
accommodate any gentleman in her _pret-<br>
ty apartment_ a whole night, for which<br>
she expects two guineas.</font></span></font></body>
