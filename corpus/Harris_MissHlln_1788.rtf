<br>
 Oh she is all the heart would wish, or eye admire,<br>
 The purest child of love by beauty fir'd;<br>
 Whom but to love, need only but to see,<br>
 To see, admire, such heaven born symmetry;<br>
 To touch, to feel, ah, there's the potent hold<br>
 That chains the will, and molds the snowy heart<br>
 To love's delightful glow; the milky hills<br>
 Half rising, half suppress'd, with glowing ardor<br>
 Ask corporeal pressure, and invite<br>
 The _carnal weapon_ to its burning sheath.<br>
<br>
 This lady, in consequence of a trivial<br>
fall out with her parents, (which by the<br>
bye she had long sought for)left her home,<br>
and flushed with all the fire of youth<br>
impetuous; burning with every desire<br>
the young hand of lust could create, and<br>
still a stranger, except in idea, to the<br>
grand _subduer_ of their fires, she sought<br>
this expanded field of delight, nor sought<br>
in vain; her youth and person soon<br>
attracted the eye of an old male veteran<br>
in our band, and her innocence and<br>
simplicity were soon overpowered, her<br>
maiden honours plucked, and all her<br>
virgin claims at once lie dead. The<br>
lively girl in question is now entering<br>
her sixteenth year, has only been four<br>
months on the town, the thinly _covered_<br>
grot below has therefore not yet suffi-<br>
ciently felt the general influence of its<br>
much sought for _acquaintance_, to be<br>
very thickly covered, still she thinks it<br>
proof against any attack, nor fears to<br>
meet the most vigorous, tho' destitute<br>
of every other weapon. She is rather<br>
darkly complexioned, with fine hazel eyes,<br>
is short, and inclinable to be lusty, and<br>
as pretty a leg and foot as man would<br>
wish to divide, which any good natured<br>
man, with two guineas in his pocket<br>
that he has no objection to spare, may<br>
lie between the whole livelong night,<br>
and taste all the raptures he can possibly<br>
expect to meet with, in one as yet so<br>
untutored in the art.<br>
