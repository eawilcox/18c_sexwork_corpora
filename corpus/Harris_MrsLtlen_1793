<body>Harris_MrsLtlen_1793Mrs. L&mdash;tle&mdash;n, No. 3, Salisbury-street, Strand.<br>
<br>
&mdash; Since we mortal lovers are, <br>
Ask not how long our love will last; <br>
But while it does, let us take care, <br>
Each minute be with pleasure past.<br>
<br>
This is a fine plump girl, with dark hair, large eyes, and dark <br>
eyebrows. It is a very great misfortune for ladies, who depend on the <br>
public for a support, to be liable to particular attachments, where <br>
interest is out of the question, for it has been of great detriment <br>
to this lady, when she has had good keepers, who have discovered her <br>
intrigues, merely through her own carelessness, and have discarded <br>
her. As her circumstances are particularly fluctuating, so her dress <br>
is answerable to them. She is, upon the whole, an agreeable woman, <br>
and we make no doubt, might live exceeding genteel, were she more <br>
guarded in her conduct, and keep herself from falling in love where <br>
there is no pecuniary view; however, at present, she is in keeping <br>
with Mr. B., a couns&mdash;r in the Temp&mdash;e, but will not lose the enjoyment <br>
of other friends, who may fall in her way.</body>
