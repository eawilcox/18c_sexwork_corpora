Harris_MrsLtlen_1793

Mrs. L\'97tle\'97n, No. 3, Salisbury-street, Strand.\
\
\'97 Since we mortal lovers are, \
Ask not how long our love will last; \
But while it does, let us take care, \
Each minute be with pleasure past.\
\
This is a fine plump girl, with dark hair, large eyes, and dark \
eyebrows. It is a very great misfortune for ladies, who depend on the \
public for a support, to be liable to particular attachments, where \
interest is out of the question, for it has been of great detriment \
to this lady, when she has had good keepers, who have discovered her \
intrigues, merely through her own carelessness, and have discarded \
her. As her circumstances are particularly fluctuating, so her dress \
is answerable to them. She is, upon the whole, an agreeable woman, \
and we make no doubt, might live exceeding genteel, were she more \
guarded in her conduct, and keep herself from falling in love where \
there is no pecuniary view; however, at present, she is in keeping \
with Mr. B., a couns\'97r in the Temp\'97e, but will not lose the enjoyment \
of other friends, who may fall in her way.\
