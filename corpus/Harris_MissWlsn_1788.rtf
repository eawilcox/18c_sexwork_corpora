 Castle-street, Leicester fields_.<br>
 '<br>
 Nature for meat and drink provides a place,<br>
 And when receiv'd they fill their certain space;<br>
 Hence _thirst_ and _hunger_ may be satisfy'd,<br>
 But this repletion is to love deny'd.<br>
<br>
 This pretty piece of animation wants<br>
not the aid of art to make her shine one<br>
of the most conspicuous in the list of tra-<br>
ding nymphs; altho' she cannot be called<br>
very handsome, still she is a fine girl,<br>
and nature has sufficiently furnish'd her<br>
with those beauties the nicest hand of<br>
art would only deface. Her want of<br>
pride (which is in this age a very rare<br>
perfection) sets off to superior advantage<br>
every feature; her goodness of temper<br>
and disposition acts as a security to her<br>
most valuable acquaintance, and her just-<br>
ness of principle gains her the esteem of<br>
all who have the happiness of knowing<br>
her. She is the daughter of a gentleman<br>
who holds a considerable place under<br>
government, has had a genteel education,<br>
and seems quite untainted with the vices<br>
of the town; her great attachment to Mr.<br>
J----n, of the theatre, is a bar to her see-<br>
ing much company; with them that has<br>
the good fortune to sleep with her, will find<br>
she still enjoys the pleasure without the<br>
least satiety; no licenc'd fair during the<br>
honey moon can charm with more rapture,<br>
or feel the poignant bliss with more ex-<br>
tacy; every inviting motion is us'd, every<br>
limb employ'd, to make the dying tran-<br>
sports meet. Her own home is the place<br>
where she in general sees her company, and<br>
every visitor that passes the night in her<br>
arms, she expects will make her two<br>
guineas richer.<br>
