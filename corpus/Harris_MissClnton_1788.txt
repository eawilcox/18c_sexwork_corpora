<br>
 Mark my eyes, and as they languish,<br>
 Read what your's have written there.<br>
<br>
 This is a very genteel made little girl,<br>
with the languishing eye of an Eloise;<br>
like her too, she is warm with the _fire_ of<br>
love, in all its native freedom, which,<br>
fanned by the amorous air, soon kindles<br>
into a flame that cannot be quenched<br>
but by the powerful effects of the<br>
_Cyprian Torrent_, which she is very fond<br>
of being _bathed in_; she has good teeth,<br>
And a lilly white skin, which is beauti-<br>
fully contrasted by a _grot_ black as the<br>
sooty raven, which, for two pounds two,<br>
will entertain you a whole night.</font></span></font></body>
