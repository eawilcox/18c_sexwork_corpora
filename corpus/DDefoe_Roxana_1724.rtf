<body>A HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF ROXANA<br>
I was born, as my friends told me, at the city of Poitiers, in the<br>
province or county of Poitou, in France, from whence I was brought to<br>
England by my parents, who fled for their religion about the year 1683,<br>
when the Protestants were banished from France by the cruelty of their<br>
persecutors.<br>
<br>
I, who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for, was<br>
well enough pleased with being here. London, a large and gay city, took<br>
with me mighty well, who, from my being a child, loved a crowd, and to<br>
see a great many fine folks.<br>
<br>
I retained nothing of France but the language, my father and mother<br>
being people of better fashion than ordinarily the people called<br>
refugees at that time were; and having fled early, while it was easy to<br>
secure their effects, had, before their coming over, remitted<br>
considerable sums of money, or, as I remember, a considerable value in<br>
French brandy, paper, and other goods; and these selling very much to<br>
advantage here, my father was in very good circumstances at his coming<br>
over, so that he was far from applying to the rest of our nation that<br>
were here for countenance and relief. On the contrary, he had his door<br>
continually thronged with miserable objects of the poor starving<br>
creatures who at that time fled hither for shelter on account of<br>
conscience, or something else.<br>
<br>
I have indeed heard my father say that he was pestered with a great many<br>
of those who, for any religion they had, might e'en have stayed where<br>
they were, but who flocked over hither in droves, for what they call in<br>
English a livelihood; hearing with what open arms the refugees were<br>
received in England, and how they fell readily into business, being, by<br>
the charitable assistance of the people in London, encouraged to work in<br>
their manufactories in Spitalfields, Canterbury, and other places, and<br>
that they had a much better price for their work than in France, and the<br>
like.<br>
<br>
My father, I say, told me that he was more pestered with the clamours of<br>
these people than of those who were truly refugees, and fled in distress<br>
merely for conscience.<br>
<br>
I was about ten years old when I was brought over hither, where, as I<br>
have said, my father lived in very good circumstances, and died in about<br>
eleven years more; in which time, as I had accomplished myself for the<br>
sociable part of the world, so I had acquainted myself with some of our<br>
English neighbours, as is the custom in London; and as, while I was<br>
young, I had picked up three or four playfellows and companions suitable<br>
to my years, so, as we grew bigger, we learned to call one another<br>
intimates and friends; and this forwarded very much the finishing me for<br>
conversation and the world.<br>
<br>
I went to English schools, and being young, I learned the English tongue<br>
perfectly well, with all the customs of the English young women; so that<br>
I retained nothing of the French but the speech; nor did I so much as<br>
keep any remains of the French language tagged to my way of speaking, as<br>
most foreigners do, but spoke what we call natural English, as if I had<br>
been born here.<br>
<br>
Being to give my own character, I must be excused to give it as<br>
impartially as possible, and as if I was speaking of another body; and<br>
the sequel will lead you to judge whether I flatter myself or no.<br>
<br>
I was (speaking of myself at about fourteen years of age) tall, and very<br>
well made; sharp as a hawk in matters of common knowledge; quick and<br>
smart in discourse; apt to be satirical; full of repartee; and a little<br>
too forward in conversation, or, as we call it in English, bold, though<br>
perfectly modest in my behaviour. Being French born, I danced, as some<br>
say, naturally, loved it extremely, and sang well also, and so well<br>
that, as you will hear, it was afterwards some advantage to me. With<br>
all these things, I wanted neither wit, beauty, or money. In this manner<br>
I set out into the world, having all the advantages that any young woman<br>
could desire, to recommend me to others, and form a prospect of happy<br>
living to myself.<br>
<br>
At about fifteen years of age, my father gave me, as he called it in<br>
French, 25,000 livres, that is to say, two thousand pounds portion, and<br>
married me to an eminent brewer in the city. Pardon me if I conceal his<br>
name; for though he was the foundation of my ruin, I cannot take so<br>
severe a revenge upon him.<br>
<br>
With this thing called a husband I lived eight years in good fashion,<br>
and for some part of the time kept a coach, that is to say, a kind of<br>
mock coach; for all the week the horses were kept at work in the<br>
dray-carts; but on Sunday I had the privilege to go abroad in my<br>
chariot, either to church or otherways, as my husband and I could agree<br>
about it, which, by the way, was not very often; but of that hereafter.<br>
<br>
Before I proceed in the history of the married part of my life, you must<br>
allow me to give as impartial an account of my husband as I have done of<br>
myself. He was a jolly, handsome fellow, as any woman need wish for a<br>
companion; tall and well made; rather a little too large, but not so as<br>
to be ungenteel; he danced well, which I think was the first thing that<br>
brought us together. He had an old father who managed the business<br>
carefully, so that he had little of that part lay on him, but now and<br>
then to appear and show himself; and he took the advantage of it, for he<br>
troubled himself very little about it, but went abroad, kept company,<br>
hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.<br>
<br>
After I have told you that he was a handsome man and a good sportsman, I<br>
have indeed said all; and unhappy was I, like other young people of our<br>
sex, I chose him for being a handsome, jolly fellow, as I have said; for<br>
he was otherwise a weak, empty-headed, untaught creature, as any woman<br>
could ever desire to be coupled with. And here I must take the liberty,<br>
whatever I have to reproach myself with in my after conduct, to turn to<br>
my fellow-creatures, the young ladies of this country, and speak to them<br>
by way of precaution. If you have any regard to your future happiness,<br>
any view of living comfortably with a husband, any hope of preserving<br>
your fortunes, or restoring them after any disaster, never, ladies,<br>
marry a fool; any husband rather than a fool. With some other husbands<br>
you may be unhappy, but with a fool you will be miserable; with another<br>
husband you may, I say, be unhappy, but with a fool you must; nay, if he<br>
would, he cannot make you easy; everything he does is so awkward,<br>
everything he says is so empty, a woman of any sense cannot but be<br>
surfeited and sick of him twenty times a day. What is more shocking than<br>
for a woman to bring a handsome, comely fellow of a husband into<br>
company, and then be obliged to blush for him every time she hears him<br>
speak? to hear other gentlemen talk sense, and he able to say nothing?<br>
and so look like a fool, or, which is worse, hear him talk nonsense, and<br>
be laughed at for a fool.<br>
<br>
In the next place, there are so many sorts of fools, such an infinite<br>
variety of fools, and so hard it is to know the worst of the kind, that<br>
I am obliged to say, &quot;No fool, ladies, at all, no kind of fool, whether<br>
a mad fool or a sober fool, a wise fool or a silly fool; take anything<br>
but a fool; nay, be anything, be even an old maid, the worst of nature's<br>
curses, rather than take up with a fool.&quot;<br>
<br>
But to leave this awhile, for I shall have occasion to speak of it<br>
again; my case was particularly hard, for I had a variety of foolish<br>
things complicated in this unhappy match.<br>
<br>
First, and which I must confess is very unsufferable, he was a conceited<br>
fool, _tout opiniatre_; everything he said was right, was best, and was<br>
to the purpose, whoever was in company, and whatever was advanced by<br>
others, though with the greatest modesty imaginable. And yet, when he<br>
came to defend what he had said by argument and reason, he would do it<br>
so weakly, so emptily, and so nothing to the purpose, that it was enough<br>
to make anybody that heard him sick and ashamed of him.<br>
<br>
Secondly, he was positive and obstinate, and the most positive in the<br>
most simple and inconsistent things, such as were intolerable to bear.<br>
<br>
These two articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a<br>
most unbearable creature for a husband; and so it may be supposed at<br>
first sight what a kind of life I led with him. However, I did as well<br>
as I could, and held my tongue, which was the only victory I gained over<br>
him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling way with me,<br>
and I would not answer, or enter into discourse with him on the point he<br>
was upon, he would rise up in the greatest passion imaginable, and go<br>
away, which was the cheapest way I had to be delivered.<br>
<br>
I could enlarge here much upon the method I took to make my life<br>
passable and easy with the most incorrigible temper in the world; but it<br>
is too long, and the articles too trifling. I shall mention some of them<br>
as the circumstances I am to relate shall necessarily bring them in.<br>
<br>
After I had been married about four years, my own father died, my mother<br>
having been dead before. He liked my match so ill, and saw so little<br>
room to be satisfied with the conduct of my husband, that though he left<br>
me five thousand livres, and more, at his death, yet he left it in the<br>
hands of my elder brother, who, running on too rashly in his adventures<br>
as a merchant, failed, and lost not only what he had, but what he had<br>
for me too, as you shall hear presently.<br>
<br>
Thus I lost the last gift of my father's bounty by having a husband not<br>
fit to be trusted with it: there's one of the benefits of marrying a<br>
fool.<br>
<br>
Within two years after my own father's death my husband's father also<br>
died, and, as I thought, left him a considerable addition to his estate,<br>
the whole trade of the brewhouse, which was a very good one, being now<br>
his own.<br>
<br>
But this addition to his stock was his ruin, for he had no genius to<br>
business, he had no knowledge of his accounts; he bustled a little about<br>
it, indeed, at first, and put on a face of business, but he soon grew<br>
slack; it was below him to inspect his books, he committed all that to<br>
his clerks and book-keepers; and while he found money in cash to pay the<br>
maltman and the excise, and put some in his pocket, he was perfectly<br>
easy and indolent, let the main chance go how it would.<br>
<br>
I foresaw the consequence of this, and attempted several times to<br>
persuade him to apply himself to his business; I put him in mind how his<br>
customers complained of the neglect of his servants on one hand, and how<br>
abundance broke in his debt, on the other hand, for want of the clerk's<br>
care to secure him, and the like; but he thrust me by, either with hard<br>
words, or fraudulently, with representing the cases otherwise than they<br>
were.<br>
<br>
However, to cut short a dull story, which ought not to be long, he began<br>
to find his trade sunk, his stock declined, and that, in short, he could<br>
not carry on his business, and once or twice his brewing utensils were<br>
extended for the excise; and, the last time, he was put to great<br>
extremities to clear them.<br>
<br>
This alarmed him, and he resolved to lay down his trade; which, indeed,<br>
I was not sorry for; foreseeing that if he did not lay it down in time,<br>
he would be forced to do it another way, namely, as a bankrupt. Also I<br>
was willing he should draw out while he had something left, lest I<br>
should come to be stripped at home, and be turned out of doors with my<br>
children; for I had now five children by him, the only work (perhaps)<br>
that fools are good for.<br>
<br>
I thought myself happy when he got another man to take his brewhouse<br>
clear off his hands; for, paying down a large sum of money, my husband<br>
found himself a clear man, all his debts paid, and with between two and<br>
three thousand pounds in his pocket; and being now obliged to remove<br>
from the brewhouse, we took a house at ----, a village about two miles<br>
out of town; and happy I thought myself, all things considered, that I<br>
was got off clear, upon so good terms; and had my handsome fellow had<br>
but one capful of wit, I had been still well enough.<br>
<br>
I proposed to him either to buy some place with the money, or with part<br>
of it, and offered to join my part to it, which was then in being, and<br>
might have been secured; so we might have lived tolerably at least<br>
during his life. But as it is the part of a fool to be void of counsel,<br>
so he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his horses and men,<br>
rid every day out to the forest a-hunting, and nothing was done all this<br>
while; but the money decreased apace, and I thought I saw my ruin<br>
hastening on without any possible way to prevent it.<br>
<br>
I was not wanting with all that persuasions and entreaties could<br>
perform, but it was all fruitless; representing to him how fast our<br>
money wasted, and what would be our condition when it was gone, made no<br>
impression on him; but like one stupid, he went on, not valuing all that<br>
tears and lamentations could be supposed to do; nor did he abate his<br>
figure or equipage, his horses or servants, even to the last, till he<br>
had not a hundred pounds left in the whole world.<br>
<br>
It was not above three years that all the ready money was thus spending<br>
off; yet he spent it, as I may say, foolishly too, for he kept no<br>
valuable company neither, but generally with huntsmen and<br>
horse-coursers, and men meaner than himself, which is another<br>
consequence of a man's being a fool; such can never take delight in men<br>
more wise and capable than themselves, and that makes them converse<br>
with scoundrels, drink, belch with porters, and keep company always<br>
below themselves.<br>
<br>
This was my wretched condition, when one morning my husband told me he<br>
was sensible he was come to a miserable condition, and he would go and<br>
seek his fortune somewhere or other. He had said something to that<br>
purpose several times before that, upon my pressing him to consider his<br>
circumstances, and the circumstances of his family, before it should be<br>
too late; but as I found he had no meaning in anything of that kind, as,<br>
indeed, he had not much in anything he ever said, so I thought they were<br>
but words of course now. When he had said he would be gone, I used to<br>
wish secretly, and even say in my thoughts, I wish you would, for if you<br>
go on thus you will starve us all.<br>
<br>
He stayed, however, at home all that day, and lay at home that night;<br>
early the next morning he gets out of bed, goes to a window which looked<br>
out towards the stable, and sounds his French horn, as he called it,<br>
which was his usual signal to call his men to go out a-hunting.<br>
<br>
It was about the latter end of August, and so was light yet at five<br>
o'clock, and it was about that time that I heard him and his two men go<br>
out and shut the yard gates after them. He said nothing to me more than<br>
as usual when he used to go out upon his sport; neither did I rise, or<br>
say anything to him that was material, but went to sleep again after he<br>
was gone, for two hours or thereabouts.<br>
<br>
It must be a little surprising to the reader to tell him at once, that<br>
after this I never saw my husband more; but, to go farther, I not only<br>
never saw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of<br>
any or either of his two servants, or of the horses, either what became<br>
of them, where or which way they went, or what they did or intended to<br>
do, no more than if the ground had opened and swallowed them all up, and<br>
nobody had known it, except as hereafter.<br>
<br>
I was not, for the first night or two, at all surprised, no, nor very<br>
much the first week or two, believing that if anything evil had befallen<br>
them, I should soon enough have heard of that; and also knowing, that as<br>
he had two servants and three horses with him, it would be the strangest<br>
thing in the world that anything could befall them all but that I must<br>
some time or other hear of them.<br>
<br>
But you will easily allow, that as time ran on, a week, two weeks, a<br>
month, two months, and so on, I was dreadfully frighted at last, and the<br>
more when I looked into my own circumstances, and considered the<br>
condition in which I was left with five children, and not one farthing<br>
subsistence for them, other than about seventy pounds in money, and what<br>
few things of value I had about me, which, though considerable in<br>
themselves, were yet nothing to feed a family, and for a length of time<br>
too.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: THE BREWER AND HIS MEN<br>
<br>
I heard him and his two men go out and shut the yard gates after them]<br>
<br>
What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have recourse: to keep in the<br>
house where I was, I could not, the rent being too great; and to leave<br>
it without his orders, if my husband should return, I could not think of<br>
that neither; so that I continued extremely perplexed, melancholy, and<br>
discouraged to the last degree.<br>
<br>
I remained in this dejected condition near a twelvemonth. My husband had<br>
two sisters, who were married, and lived very well, and some other near<br>
relations that I knew of, and I hoped would do something for me; and I<br>
frequently sent to these, to know if they could give me any account of<br>
my vagrant creature. But they all declared to me in answer, that they<br>
knew nothing about him; and, after frequent sending, began to think me<br>
troublesome, and to let me know they thought so too, by their treating<br>
my maid with very slight and unhandsome returns to her inquiries.<br>
<br>
This grated hard, and added to my affliction; but I had no recourse but<br>
to my tears, for I had not a friend of my own left me in the world. I<br>
should have observed, that it was about half a year before this<br>
elopement of my husband that the disaster I mentioned above befell my<br>
brother, who broke, and that in such bad circumstances, that I had the<br>
mortification to hear, not only that he was in prison, but that there<br>
would be little or nothing to be had by way of composition.<br>
<br>
Misfortunes seldom come alone: this was the forerunner of my husband's<br>
flight; and as my expectations were cut off on that side, my husband<br>
gone, and my family of children on my hands, and nothing to subsist<br>
them, my condition was the most deplorable that words can express.<br>
<br>
I had some plate and some jewels, as might be supposed, my fortune and<br>
former circumstances considered; and my husband, who had never stayed to<br>
be distressed, had not been put to the necessity of rifling me, as<br>
husbands usually do in such cases. But as I had seen an end of all the<br>
ready money during the long time I had lived in a state of expectation<br>
for my husband, so I began to make away one thing after another, till<br>
those few things of value which I had began to lessen apace, and I saw<br>
nothing but misery and the utmost distress before me, even to have my<br>
children starve before my face. I leave any one that is a mother of<br>
children, and has lived in plenty and in good fashion, to consider and<br>
reflect what must be my condition. As to my husband, I had now no hope<br>
or expectation of seeing him any more; and indeed, if I had, he was a<br>
man of all the men in the world the least able to help me, or to have<br>
turned his hand to the gaining one shilling towards lessening our<br>
distress; he neither had the capacity or the inclination; he could have<br>
been no clerk, for he scarce wrote a legible hand; he was so far from<br>
being able to write sense, that he could not make sense of what others<br>
wrote; he was so far from understanding good English, that he could not<br>
spell good English; to be out of all business was his delight, and he<br>
would stand leaning against a post for half-an-hour together, with a<br>
pipe in his mouth, with all the tranquillity in the world, smoking, like<br>
Dryden's countryman, that whistled as he went for want of thought, and<br>
this even when his family was, as it were, starving, that little he had<br>
wasting, and that we were all bleeding to death; he not knowing, and as<br>
little considering, where to get another shilling when the last was<br>
spent.<br>
<br>
This being his temper, and the extent of his capacity, I confess I did<br>
not see so much loss in his parting with me as at first I thought I did;<br>
though it was hard and cruel to the last degree in him, not giving me<br>
the least notice of his design; and indeed, that which I was most<br>
astonished at was, that seeing he must certainly have intended this<br>
excursion some few moments at least before he put it in practice, yet he<br>
did not come and take what little stock of money we had left, or at<br>
least a share of it, to bear his expense for a little while; but he did<br>
not; and I am morally certain he had not five guineas with him in the<br>
world when he went away. All that I could come to the knowledge of about<br>
him was, that he left his hunting-horn, which he called the French horn,<br>
in the stable, and his hunting-saddle, went away in a handsome<br>
furniture, as they call it, which he used sometimes to travel with,<br>
having an embroidered housing, a case of pistols, and other things<br>
belonging to them; and one of his servants had another saddle with<br>
pistols, though plain, and the other a long gun; so that they did not go<br>
out as sportsmen, but rather as travellers; what part of the world they<br>
went to I never heard for many years.<br>
<br>
As I have said, I sent to his relations, but they sent me short and<br>
surly answers; nor did any one of them offer to come to see me, or to<br>
see the children, or so much as to inquire after them, well perceiving<br>
that I was in a condition that was likely to be soon troublesome to<br>
them. But it was no time now to dally with them or with the world; I<br>
left off sending to them, and went myself among them, laid my<br>
circumstances open to them, told them my whole case, and the condition I<br>
was reduced to, begged they would advise me what course to take, laid<br>
myself as low as they could desire, and entreated them to consider that<br>
I was not in a condition to help myself, and that without some<br>
assistance we must all inevitably perish. I told them that if I had had<br>
but one child, or two children, I would have done my endeavour to have<br>
worked for them with my needle, and should only have come to them to beg<br>
them to help me to some work, that I might get our bread by my labour;<br>
but to think of one single woman, not bred to work, and at a loss where<br>
to get employment, to get the bread of five children, that was not<br>
possible--some of my children being young too, and none of them big<br>
enough to help one another.<br>
<br>
It was all one; I received not one farthing of assistance from anybody,<br>
was hardly asked to sit down at the two sisters' houses, nor offered to<br>
eat or drink at two more near relations'. The fifth, an ancient<br>
gentlewoman, aunt-in-law to my husband, a widow, and the least able also<br>
of any of the rest, did, indeed, ask me to sit down, gave me a dinner,<br>
and refreshed me with a kinder treatment than any of the rest, but added<br>
the melancholy part, viz., that she would have helped me, but that,<br>
indeed, she was not able, which, however, I was satisfied was very true.<br>
<br>
Here I relieved myself with the constant assistant of the afflicted, I<br>
mean tears; for, relating to her how I was received by the other of my<br>
husband's relations, it made me burst into tears, and I cried vehemently<br>
for a great while together, till I made the good old gentlewoman cry too<br>
several times.<br>
<br>
However, I came home from them all without any relief, and went on at<br>
home till I was reduced to such inexpressible distress that is not to be<br>
described. I had been several times after this at the old aunt's, for I<br>
prevailed with her to promise me to go and talk with the other<br>
relations, at least, that, if possible, she could bring some of them to<br>
take off the children, or to contribute something towards their<br>
maintenance. And, to do her justice, she did use her endeavour with<br>
them; but all was to no purpose, they would do nothing, at least that<br>
way. I think, with much entreaty, she obtained, by a kind of collection<br>
among them all, about eleven or twelve shillings in money, which, though<br>
it was a present comfort, was yet not to be named as capable to deliver<br>
me from any part of the load that lay upon me.<br>
<br>
There was a poor woman that had been a kind of a dependent upon our<br>
family, and whom I had often, among the rest of the relations, been very<br>
kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor<br>
woman, and to see whether she might not be able to help in this dreadful<br>
case.<br>
<br>
I must remember it here, to the praise of this poor girl, my maid, that<br>
though I was not able to give her any wages, and had told her so--nay, I<br>
was not able to pay her the wages that I was in arrears to her--yet she<br>
would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any money, when I had<br>
none, she would help me out of her own, for which, though I acknowledged<br>
her kindness and fidelity, yet it was but a bad coin that she was paid<br>
in at last, as will appear in its place.<br>
<br>
Amy (for that was her name) put it into my thoughts to send for this<br>
poor woman to come to me; for I was now in great distress, and I<br>
resolved to do so. But just the very morning that I intended it, the old<br>
aunt, with the poor woman in her company, came to see me; the good old<br>
gentlewoman was, it seems, heartily concerned for me, and had been<br>
talking again among those people, to see what she could do for me, but<br>
to very little purpose.<br>
<br>
You shall judge a little of my present distress by the posture she found<br>
me in. I had five little children, the eldest was under ten years old,<br>
and I had not one shilling in the house to buy them victuals, but had<br>
sent Amy out with a silver spoon to sell it, and bring home something<br>
from the butcher's; and I was in a parlour, sitting on the ground, with<br>
a great heap of old rags, linen, and other things about me, looking them<br>
over, to see if I had anything among them that would sell or pawn for a<br>
little money, and had been crying ready to burst myself, to think what I<br>
should do next.<br>
<br>
At this juncture they knocked at the door. I thought it had been Amy,<br>
so I did not rise up; but one of the children opened the door, and they<br>
came directly into the room where I was, and where they found me in that<br>
posture, and crying vehemently, as above. I was surprised at their<br>
coming, you may be sure, especially seeing the person I had but just<br>
before resolved to send for; but when they saw me, how I looked, for my<br>
eyes were swelled with crying, and what a condition I was in as to the<br>
house, and the heaps of things that were about me, and especially when I<br>
told them what I was doing, and on what occasion, they sat down, like<br>
Job's three comforters, and said not one word to me for a great while,<br>
but both of them cried as fast and as heartily as I did.<br>
<br>
The truth was, there was no need of much discourse in the case, the<br>
thing spoke itself; they saw me in rags and dirt, who was but a little<br>
before riding in my coach; thin, and looking almost like one starved,<br>
who was before fat and beautiful. The house, that was before handsomely<br>
furnished with pictures and ornaments, cabinets, pier-glasses, and<br>
everything suitable, was now stripped and naked, most of the goods<br>
having been seized by the landlord for rent, or sold to buy necessaries;<br>
in a word, all was misery and distress, the face of ruin was everywhere<br>
to be seen; we had eaten up almost everything, and little remained,<br>
unless, like one of the pitiful women of Jerusalem, I should eat up my<br>
very children themselves.<br>
<br>
After these two good creatures had sat, as I say, in silence some time,<br>
and had then looked about them, my maid Amy came in, and brought with<br>
her a small breast of mutton and two great bunches of turnips, which she<br>
intended to stew for our dinner. As for me, my heart was so overwhelmed<br>
at seeing these two friends--for such they were, though poor--and at<br>
their seeing me in such a condition, that I fell into another violent<br>
fit of crying, so that, in short, I could not speak to them again for a<br>
great while longer.<br>
<br>
During my being in such an agony, they went to my maid Amy at another<br>
part of the same room and talked with her. Amy told them all my<br>
circumstances, and set them forth in such moving terms, and so to the<br>
life, that I could not upon any terms have done it like her myself, and,<br>
in a word, affected them both with it in such a manner, that the old<br>
aunt came to me, and though hardly able to speak for tears, &quot;Look ye,<br>
cousin,&quot; said she, in a few words, &quot;things must not stand thus; some<br>
course must be taken, and that forthwith; pray, where were these<br>
children born?&quot; I told her the parish where we lived before, that four<br>
of them were born there, and one in the house where I now was, where the<br>
landlord, after having seized my goods for the rent past, not then<br>
knowing my circumstances, had now given me leave to live for a whole<br>
year more without any rent, being moved with compassion; but that this<br>
year was now almost expired.<br>
<br>
Upon hearing this account, they came to this resolution, that the<br>
children should be all carried by them to the door of one of the<br>
relations mentioned above, and be set down there by the maid Amy, and<br>
that I, the mother, should remove for some days, shut up the doors, and<br>
be gone; that the people should be told, that if they did not think fit<br>
to take some care of the children, they might send for the churchwardens<br>
if they thought that better, for that they were born in that parish, and<br>
there they must be provided for; as for the other child, which was born<br>
in the parish of ----, that was already taken care of by the parish<br>
officers there, for indeed they were so sensible of the distress of the<br>
family that they had at first word done what was their part to do.<br>
<br>
This was what these good women proposed, and bade me leave the rest to<br>
them. I was at first sadly afflicted at the thoughts of parting with my<br>
children, and especially at that terrible thing, their being taken into<br>
the parish keeping; and then a hundred terrible things came into my<br>
thoughts, viz., of parish children being starved at nurse; of their<br>
being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being<br>
taken care of; and this sunk my very heart within me.<br>
<br>
But the misery of my own circumstances hardened my heart against my own<br>
flesh and blood; and when I considered they must inevitably be starved,<br>
and I too if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconciled<br>
to parting with them all, anyhow and anywhere, that I might be freed<br>
from the dreadful necessity of seeing them all perish, and perishing<br>
with them myself. So I agreed to go away out of the house, and leave the<br>
management of the whole matter to my maid Amy and to them; and<br>
accordingly I did so, and the same afternoon they carried them all away<br>
to one of their aunts.<br>
<br>
Amy, a resolute girl, knocked at the door, with the children all with<br>
her, and bade the eldest, as soon as the door was open, run in, and the<br>
rest after her. She set them all down at the door before she knocked,<br>
and when she knocked she stayed till a maid-servant came to the door;<br>
&quot;Sweetheart,&quot; said she, &quot;pray go in and tell your mistress here are her<br>
little cousins come to see her from ----,&quot; naming the town where we<br>
lived, at which the maid offered to go back. &quot;Here, child,&quot; says Amy,<br>
&quot;take one of 'em in your hand, and I'll bring the rest;&quot; so she gives<br>
her the least, and the wench goes in mighty innocently, with the little<br>
one in her hand, upon which Amy turns the rest in after her, shuts the<br>
door softly, and marches off as fast as she could.<br>
<br>
Just in the interval of this, and even while the maid and her mistress<br>
were quarrelling (for the mistress raved and scolded her like a mad<br>
woman, and had ordered her to go and stop the maid Amy, and turn all the<br>
children out of the doors again; but she had been at the door, and Amy<br>
was gone, and the wench was out of her wits, and the mistress too), I<br>
say, just at this juncture came the poor old woman, not the aunt, but<br>
the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the door: the<br>
aunt did not go, because she had pretended to advocate for me, and they<br>
would have suspected her of some contrivance; but as for the other<br>
woman, they did not so much as know that she had kept up any<br>
correspondence with me.<br>
<br>
Amy and she had concerted this between them, and it was well enough<br>
contrived that they did so. When she came into the house, the mistress<br>
was fuming, and raging like one distracted, and called the maid all the<br>
foolish jades and sluts that she could think of, and that she would take<br>
the children and turn them all out into the streets. The good poor<br>
woman, seeing her in such a passion, turned about as if she would be<br>
gone again, and said, &quot;Madam, I'll come again another time, I see you<br>
are engaged.&quot; &quot;No, no, Mrs. ----,&quot; says the mistress, &quot;I am not much<br>
engaged, sit down; this senseless creature here has brought in my fool<br>
of a brother's whole house of children upon me, and tells me that a<br>
wench brought them to the door and thrust them in, and bade her carry<br>
them to me; but it shall be no disturbance to me, for I have ordered<br>
them to be set in the street without the door, and so let the<br>
churchwardens take care of them, or else make this dull jade carry 'em<br>
back to ---- again, and let her that brought them into the world look<br>
after them if she will; what does she send her brats to me for?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The last indeed had been the best of the two,&quot; says the poor woman, &quot;if<br>
it had been to be done; and that brings me to tell you my errand, and<br>
the occasion of my coming, for I came on purpose about this very<br>
business, and to have prevented this being put upon you if I could, but<br>
I see I am come too late.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;How do you mean too late?&quot; says the mistress. &quot;What! have you been<br>
concerned in this affair, then? What! have you helped bring this family<br>
slur upon us?&quot; &quot;I hope you do not think such a thing of me, madam,&quot; says<br>
the poor woman; &quot;but I went this morning to ----, to see my old mistress<br>
and benefactor, for she had been very kind to me, and when I came to the<br>
door I found all fast locked and bolted, and the house looking as if<br>
nobody was at home.<br>
<br>
&quot;I knocked at the door, but nobody came, till at last some of the<br>
neighbours' servants called to me and said, 'There's nobody lives there,<br>
mistress; what do you knock for?' I seemed surprised at that. 'What,<br>
nobody lives there!' said I; 'what d'ye mean? Does not Mrs. ---- live<br>
there?' The answer was, 'No, she is gone;' at which I parleyed with one<br>
of them, and asked her what was the matter. 'Matter!' says she, 'why, it<br>
is matter enough: the poor gentlewoman has lived there all alone, and<br>
without anything to subsist her a long time, and this morning the<br>
landlord turned her out of doors.'<br>
<br>
&quot;'Out of doors!' says I; 'what! with all her children? Poor lambs, what<br>
is become of them?' 'Why, truly, nothing worse,' said they, 'can come to<br>
them than staying here, for they were almost starved with hunger; so the<br>
neighbours, seeing the poor lady in such distress, for she stood crying<br>
and wringing her hands over her children like one distracted, sent for<br>
the churchwardens to take care of the children; and they, when they<br>
came, took the youngest, which was born in this parish, and have got it<br>
a very good nurse, and taken care of it; but as for the other four, they<br>
had sent them away to some of their father's relations, and who were<br>
very substantial people, and who, besides that, lived in the parish<br>
where they were born.'<br>
<br>
&quot;I was not so surprised at this as not presently to foresee that this<br>
trouble would be brought upon you or upon Mr. ----; so I came immediately<br>
to bring word of it, that you might be prepared for it, and might not be<br>
surprised; but I see they have been too nimble for me, so that I know<br>
not what to advise. The poor woman, it seems, is turned out of doors<br>
into the street; and another of the neighbours there told me, that when<br>
they took her children from her she swooned away, and when they<br>
recovered her out of that, she ran distracted, and is put into a<br>
madhouse by the parish, for there is nobody else to take any care of<br>
her.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was all acted to the life by this good, kind, poor creature; for<br>
though her design was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not<br>
one word of it true in fact; for I was not turned out of doors by the<br>
landlord, nor gone distracted. It was true, indeed, that at parting with<br>
my poor children I fainted, and was like one mad when I came to myself<br>
and found they were gone; but I remained in the house a good while after<br>
that, as you shall hear.<br>
<br>
While the poor woman was telling this dismal story, in came the<br>
gentlewoman's husband, and though her heart was hardened against all<br>
pity, who was really and nearly related to the children, for they were<br>
the children of her own brother, yet the good man was quite softened<br>
with the dismal relation of the circumstances of the family; and when<br>
the poor woman had done, he said to his wife, &quot;This is a dismal case,<br>
my dear, indeed, and something must be done.&quot; His wife fell a-raving at<br>
him: &quot;What,&quot; says she, &quot;do you want to have four children to keep? Have<br>
we not children of our own? Would you have these brats come and eat up<br>
my children's bread? No, no, let 'em go to the parish, and let them take<br>
care of them; I'll take care of my own.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, come, my dear,&quot; says the husband, &quot;charity is a duty to the poor,<br>
and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord; let us lend our<br>
heavenly Father a little of our children's bread, as you call it; it<br>
will be a store well laid up for them, and will be the best security<br>
that our children shall never come to want charity, or be turned out of<br>
doors, as these poor innocent creatures are.&quot; &quot;Don't tell me of<br>
security,&quot; says the wife, &quot;'tis a good security for our children to keep<br>
what we have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis time enough<br>
to help keep other folks' children. Charity begins at home.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; says he again, &quot;I only talk of putting out a little<br>
money to interest: our Maker is a good borrower; never fear making a bad<br>
debt there, child, I'll be bound for it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't banter me with your charity and your allegories,&quot; says the wife<br>
angrily; &quot;I tell you they are my relations, not yours, and they shall<br>
not roost here; they shall go to the parish.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;All your relations are my relations now,&quot; says the good gentleman very<br>
calmly, &quot;and I won't see your relations in distress, and not pity them,<br>
any more than I would my own; indeed, my dear, they shan't go to the<br>
parish. I assure you, none of my wife's relations shall come to the<br>
parish, if I can help it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What! will you take four children to keep?&quot; says the wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;there's your sister ----, I'll go and talk<br>
with her; and your uncle ----, I'll send for him, and the rest. I'll<br>
warrant you, when we are all together, we will find ways and means to<br>
keep four poor little creatures from beggary and starving, or else it<br>
would be very hard; we are none of us in so bad circumstances but we are<br>
able to spare a mite for the fatherless. Don't shut up your bowels of<br>
compassion against your own flesh and blood. Could you hear these poor<br>
innocent children cry at your door for hunger, and give them no bread?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prithee, what need they cry at our door?&quot; says she. &quot;'Tis the business<br>
of the parish to provide for them; they shan't cry at our door. If they<br>
do, I'll give them nothing.&quot; &quot;Won't you?&quot; says he; &quot;but I will. Remember<br>
that dreadful Scripture is directly against us, Prov. xxi. 13, 'Whoso<br>
stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but<br>
shall not be heard.'&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well,&quot; says she, &quot;you must do what you will, because you pretend<br>
to be master; but if I had my will I would send them where they ought to<br>
be sent: I would send them from whence they came.&quot;<br>
<br>
Then the poor woman put in, and said, &quot;But, madam, that is sending them<br>
to starve indeed, for the parish has no obligation to take care of 'em,<br>
and so they will lie and perish in the street.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Or be sent back again,&quot; says the husband, &quot;to our parish in a<br>
cripple-cart, by the justice's warrant, and so expose us and all the<br>
relations to the last degree among our neighbours, and among those who<br>
know the good old gentleman their grandfather, who lived and flourished<br>
in this parish so many years, and was so well beloved among all people,<br>
and deserved it so well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't value that one farthing, not I,&quot; says the wife; &quot;I'll keep none<br>
of them.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; says her husband, &quot;but I value it, for I won't have<br>
such a blot lie upon the family, and upon your children; he was a<br>
worthy, ancient, and good man, and his name is respected among all his<br>
neighbours; it will be a reproach to you, that are his daughter, and to<br>
our children, that are his grandchildren, that we should let your<br>
brother's children perish, or come to be a charge to the public, in the<br>
very place where your family once flourished. Come, say no more; I will<br>
see what can be done.&quot;<br>
<br>
Upon this he sends and gathers all the relations together at a tavern<br>
hard by, and sent for the four little children, that they might see<br>
them; and they all, at first word, agreed to have them taken care of,<br>
and, because his wife was so furious that she would not suffer one of<br>
them to be kept at home, they agreed to keep them all together for a<br>
while; so they committed them to the poor woman that had managed the<br>
affair for them, and entered into obligations to one another to supply<br>
the needful sums for their maintenance; and, not to have one separated<br>
from the rest, they sent for the youngest from the parish where it was<br>
taken in, and had them all brought up together.<br>
<br>
It would take up too long a part of this story to give a particular<br>
account with what a charitable tenderness this good person, who was but<br>
an uncle-in-law to them, managed that affair; how careful he was of<br>
them; went constantly to see them, and to see that they were well<br>
provided for, clothed, put to school, and, at last, put out in the world<br>
for their advantage; but it is enough to say he acted more like a father<br>
to them than an uncle-in-law, though all along much against his wife's<br>
consent, who was of a disposition not so tender and compassionate as<br>
her husband.<br>
<br>
You may believe I heard this with the same pleasure which I now feel at<br>
the relating it again; for I was terribly affrighted at the<br>
apprehensions of my children being brought to misery and distress, as<br>
those must be who have no friends, but are left to parish benevolence.<br>
<br>
I was now, however, entering on a new scene of life. I had a great house<br>
upon my hands, and some furniture left in it; but I was no more able to<br>
maintain myself and my maid Amy in it than I was my five children; nor<br>
had I anything to subsist with but what I might get by working, and that<br>
was not a town where much work was to be had.<br>
<br>
My landlord had been very kind indeed after he came to know my<br>
circumstances; though, before he was acquainted with that part, he had<br>
gone so far as to seize my goods, and to carry some of them off too.<br>
<br>
But I had lived three-quarters of a year in his house after that, and<br>
had paid him no rent, and, which was worse, I was in no condition to pay<br>
him any. However, I observed he came oftener to see me, looked kinder<br>
upon me, and spoke more friendly to me, than he used to do, particularly<br>
the last two or three times he had been there. He observed, he said, how<br>
poorly I lived, how low I was reduced, and the like; told me it grieved<br>
him for my sake; and the last time of all he was kinder still, told me<br>
he came to dine with me, and that I should give him leave to treat me;<br>
so he called my maid Amy, and sent her out to buy a joint of meat; he<br>
told her what she should buy; but naming two or three things, either of<br>
which she might take, the maid, a cunning wench, and faithful to me as<br>
the skin to my back, did not buy anything outright, but brought the<br>
butcher along with her, with both the things that she had chosen, for<br>
him to please himself. The one was a large, very good leg of veal; the<br>
other a piece of the fore-ribs of roasting beef. He looked at them, but<br>
made me chaffer with the butcher for him, and I did so, and came back to<br>
him and told him what the butcher had demanded for either of them, and<br>
what each of them came to. So he pulls out eleven shillings and<br>
threepence, which they came to together, and bade me take them both; the<br>
rest, he said, would serve another time.<br>
<br>
I was surprised, you may be sure, at the bounty of a man that had but a<br>
little while ago been my terror, and had torn the goods out of my house<br>
like a fury; but I considered that my distresses had mollified his<br>
temper, and that he had afterwards been so compassionate as to give me<br>
leave to live rent free in the house a whole year.<br>
<br>
But now he put on the face, not of a man of compassion only, but of a<br>
man of friendship and kindness, and this was so unexpected that it was<br>
surprising. We chatted together, and were, as I may call it, cheerful,<br>
which was more than I could say I had been for three years before. He<br>
sent for wine and beer too, for I had none; poor Amy and I had drank<br>
nothing but water for many weeks, and indeed I have often wondered at<br>
the faithful temper of the poor girl, for which I but ill requited her<br>
at last.<br>
<br>
When Amy was come with the wine, he made her fill a glass to him, and<br>
with the glass in his hand he came to me and kissed me, which I was, I<br>
confess, a little surprised at, but more at what followed; for he told<br>
me, that as the sad condition which I was reduced to had made him pity<br>
me, so my conduct in it, and the courage I bore it with, had given him a<br>
more than ordinary respect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my<br>
good; that he was resolved for the present to do something to relieve<br>
me, and to employ his thoughts in the meantime, to see if he could for<br>
the future put me into a way to support myself.<br>
<br>
While he found me change colour, and look surprised at his discourse,<br>
for so I did, to be sure, he turns to my maid Amy, and looking at her,<br>
he says to me, &quot;I say all this, madam, before your maid, because both<br>
she and you shall know that I have no ill design, and that I have, in<br>
mere kindness, resolved to do something for you if I can; and as I have<br>
been a witness of the uncommon honesty and fidelity of Mrs. Amy here to<br>
you in all your distresses, I know she may be trusted with so honest a<br>
design as mine is; for I assure you, I bear a proportioned regard to<br>
your maid too, for her affection to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy made him a curtsey, and the poor girl looked so confounded with joy<br>
that she could not speak, but her colour came and went, and every now<br>
and then she blushed as red as scarlet, and the next minute looked as<br>
pale as death. Well, having said this, he sat down, made me sit down,<br>
and then drank to me, and made me drink two glasses of wine together;<br>
&quot;For,&quot; says he, &quot;you have need of it;&quot; and so indeed I had. When he had<br>
done so, &quot;Come, Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;with your mistress's leave, you shall<br>
have a glass too.&quot; So he made her drink two glasses also; and then<br>
rising up, &quot;And now, Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;go and get dinner; and you, madam,&quot;<br>
says he to me, &quot;go up and dress you, and come down and smile and be<br>
merry;&quot; adding, &quot;I'll make you easy if I can;&quot; and in the meantime, he<br>
said, he would walk in the garden.<br>
<br>
When he was gone, Amy changed her countenance indeed, and looked as<br>
merry as ever she did in her life. &quot;Dear madam,&quot; says she, &quot;what does<br>
this gentleman mean?&quot; &quot;Nay, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;he means to do us good, you<br>
see, don't he? I know no other meaning he can have, for he can get<br>
nothing by me.&quot; &quot;I warrant you, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;he'll ask you a<br>
favour by-and-by.&quot; &quot;No, no, you are mistaken, Amy, I dare say,&quot; said I;<br>
&quot;you have heard what he said, didn't you?&quot; &quot;Ay,&quot; says Amy, &quot;it's no<br>
matter for that, you shall see what he will do after dinner.&quot; &quot;Well,<br>
well, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;you have hard thoughts of him. I cannot be of your<br>
opinion: I don't see anything in him yet that looks like it.&quot; &quot;As to<br>
that, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I don't see anything of it yet neither; but<br>
what should move a gentleman to take pity of us as he does?&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot; says<br>
I, &quot;that's a hard thing too, that we should judge a man to be wicked<br>
because he's charitable, and vicious because he's kind.&quot; &quot;Oh, madam,&quot;<br>
says Amy, &quot;there's abundance of charity begins in that vice; and he is<br>
not so unacquainted with things as not to know that poverty is the<br>
strongest incentive--a temptation against which no virtue is powerful<br>
enough to stand out. He knows your condition as well as you do.&quot; &quot;Well,<br>
and what then?&quot; &quot;Why, then, he knows too that you are young and<br>
handsome, and he has the surest bait in the world to take you with.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;but he may find himself mistaken too in such a<br>
thing as that.&quot; &quot;Why, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I hope you won't deny him if he<br>
should offer it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What d'ye mean by that, hussy?&quot; said I. &quot;No, I'd starve first.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope not, madam, I hope you would be wiser; I'm sure if he will set<br>
you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will<br>
starve if you do not consent, that's certain.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What! consent to lie with him for bread? Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;how can you<br>
talk so!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I don't think you would for anything else; it<br>
would not be lawful for anything else, but for bread, madam; why, nobody<br>
can starve, there's no bearing that, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay,&quot; says I, &quot;but if he would give me an estate to live on, he should<br>
not lie with me, I assure you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, look you, madam; if he would but give you enough to live easy<br>
upon, he should lie with me for it with all my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a token, Amy, of inimitable kindness to me,&quot; said I, &quot;and I know<br>
how to value it; but there's more friendship than honesty in it, Amy.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I'd do anything to get you out of this sad<br>
condition; as to honesty, I think honesty is out of the question when<br>
starving is the case. Are not we almost starved to death?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am indeed,&quot; said I, &quot;and thou art for my sake; but to be a whore,<br>
Amy!&quot; and there I stopped.<br>
<br>
&quot;Dear madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;if I will starve for your sake, I will be a<br>
whore or anything for your sake; why, I would die for you if I were put<br>
to it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, that's an excess of affection, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;I never met with<br>
before; I wish I may be ever in condition to make you some returns<br>
suitable. But, however, Amy, you shall not be a whore to him, to oblige<br>
him to be kind to me; no, Amy, nor I won't be a whore to him, if he<br>
would give me much more than he is able to give me or do for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I don't say I will go and ask him; but I say,<br>
if he should promise to do so and so for you, and the condition was such<br>
that he would not serve you unless I would let him lie with me, he<br>
should lie with me as often as he would, rather than you should not have<br>
his assistance. But this is but talk, madam; I don't see any need of<br>
such discourse, and you are of opinion that there will be no need of<br>
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed so I am, Amy; but,&quot; said I, &quot;if there was, I tell you again, I'd<br>
die before I would consent, or before you should consent for my sake.&quot;<br>
<br>
Hitherto I had not only preserved the virtue itself, but the virtuous<br>
inclination and resolution; and had I kept myself there I had been<br>
happy, though I had perished of mere hunger; for, without question, a<br>
woman ought rather to die than to prostitute her virtue and honour, let<br>
the temptation be what it will.<br>
<br>
But to return to my story; he walked about the garden, which was,<br>
indeed, all in disorder, and overrun with weeds, because I had not been<br>
able to hire a gardener to do anything to it, no, not so much as to dig<br>
up ground enough to sow a few turnips and carrots for family use. After<br>
he had viewed it, he came in, and sent Amy to fetch a poor man, a<br>
gardener, that used to help our man-servant, and carried him into the<br>
garden, and ordered him to do several things in it, to put it into a<br>
little order; and this took him up near an hour.<br>
<br>
By this time I had dressed me as well as I could; for though I had good<br>
linen left still, yet I had but a poor head-dress, and no knots, but old<br>
fragments; no necklace, no earrings; all those things were gone long ago<br>
for mere bread.<br>
<br>
However, I was tight and clean, and in better plight than he had seen me<br>
in a great while, and he looked extremely pleased to see me so; for, he<br>
said, I looked so disconsolate and so afflicted before, that it grieved<br>
him to see me; and he bade me pluck up a good heart, for he hoped to put<br>
me in a condition to live in the world, and be beholden to nobody.<br>
<br>
I told him that was impossible, for I must be beholden to him for it,<br>
for all the friends I had in the world would not or could not do so much<br>
for me as that he spoke of &quot;Well, widow,&quot; says he (so he called me, and<br>
so indeed I was in the worst sense that desolate word could be used<br>
in), &quot;if you are beholden to me, you shall be beholden to nobody else.&quot;<br>
<br>
By this time dinner was ready, and Amy came in to lay the cloth, and<br>
indeed it was happy there was none to dine but he and I, for I had but<br>
six plates left in the house, and but two dishes; however, he knew how<br>
things were, and bade me make no scruple about bringing out what I had.<br>
He hoped to see me in a better plight. He did not come, he said, to be<br>
entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me. Thus he<br>
went on, speaking so cheerfully to me, and such cheerful things, that it<br>
was a cordial to my very soul to hear him speak.<br>
<br>
Well, we went to dinner. I'm sure I had not ate a good meal hardly in a<br>
twelvemonth, at least not of such a joint of meat as the loin of veal<br>
was. I ate, indeed, very heartily, and so did he, and he made me drink<br>
three or four glasses of wine; so that, in short, my spirits were lifted<br>
up to a degree I had not been used to, and I was not only cheerful, but<br>
merry; and so he pressed me to be.<br>
<br>
I told him I had a great deal of reason to be merry, seeing he had been<br>
so kind to me, and had given me hopes of recovering me from the worst<br>
circumstances that ever woman of any sort of fortune was sunk into; that<br>
he could not but believe that what he had said to me was like life from<br>
the dead; that it was like recovering one sick from the brink of the<br>
grave; how I should ever make him a return any way suitable was what I<br>
had not yet had time to think of; I could only say that I should never<br>
forget it while I had life, and should be always ready to acknowledge<br>
it.<br>
<br>
He said that was all he desired of me; that his reward would be the<br>
satisfaction of having rescued me from misery; that he found he was<br>
obliging one that knew what gratitude meant; that he would make it his<br>
business to make me completely easy, first or last, if it lay in his<br>
power; and in the meantime he bade me consider of anything that I<br>
thought he might do for me, for my advantage, and in order to make me<br>
perfectly easy.<br>
<br>
After we had talked thus, he bade me be cheerful. &quot;Come,&quot; says he, &quot;lay<br>
aside these melancholy things, and let us be merry.&quot; Amy waited at the<br>
table, and she smiled and laughed, and was so merry she could hardly<br>
contain it, for the girl loved me to an excess hardly to be described;<br>
and it was such an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her<br>
mistress, that the wench was beside herself almost, and, as soon as<br>
dinner was over, Amy went upstairs, and put on her best clothes too, and<br>
came down dressed like a gentlewoman.<br>
<br>
We sat together talking of a thousand things--of what had been, and what<br>
was to be--all the rest of the day, and in the evening he took his<br>
leave of me, with a thousand expressions of kindness and tenderness and<br>
true affection to me, but offered not the least of what my maid Amy had<br>
suggested.<br>
<br>
At his going away he took me in his arms, protested an honest kindness<br>
to me; said a thousand kind things to me, which I cannot now recollect;<br>
and, after kissing me twenty times or thereabouts, put a guinea into my<br>
hand, which, he said, was for my present supply, and told me that he<br>
would see me again before it was out; also he gave Amy half-a-crown.<br>
<br>
When he was gone, &quot;Well, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;are you convinced now that he is<br>
an honest as well as a true friend, and that there has been nothing, not<br>
the least appearance of anything, of what you imagined in his<br>
behaviour?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I am, but I admire at it. He is such a<br>
friend as the world, sure, has not abundance of to show.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sure,&quot; says I, &quot;he is such a friend as I have long wanted, and as<br>
I have as much need of as any creature in the world has or ever had.&quot;<br>
And, in short, I was so overcome with the comfort of it that I sat down<br>
and cried for joy a good while, as I had formerly cried for sorrow. Amy<br>
and I went to bed that night (for Amy lay with me) pretty early, but lay<br>
chatting almost all night about it, and the girl was so transported that<br>
she got up two or three times in the night and danced about the room in<br>
her shift; in short, the girl was half distracted with the joy of it; a<br>
testimony still of her violent affection for her mistress, in which no<br>
servant ever went beyond her.<br>
<br>
We heard no more of him for two days, but the third day he came again;<br>
then he told me, with the same kindness, that he had ordered me a supply<br>
of household goods for the furnishing the house; that, in particular, he<br>
had sent me back all the goods that he had seized for rent, which<br>
consisted, indeed, of the best of my former furniture. &quot;And now,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;I'll tell you what I have had in my head for you for your present<br>
supply, and that is,&quot; says he, &quot;that the house being well furnished, you<br>
shall let it out to lodgings for the summer gentry,&quot; says he, &quot;by which<br>
you will easily get a good comfortable subsistence, especially seeing<br>
you shall pay me no rent for two years, nor after neither, unless you<br>
can afford it.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was the first view I had of living comfortably indeed, and it was a<br>
very probable way, I must confess, seeing we had very good conveniences,<br>
six rooms on a floor, and three stories high. While he was laying down<br>
the scheme of my management, came a cart to the door with a load of<br>
goods, and an upholsterer's man to put them up. They were chiefly the<br>
furniture of two rooms which he had carried away for his two years'<br>
rent, with two fine cabinets, and some pier-glasses out of the parlour,<br>
and several other valuable things.<br>
<br>
These were all restored to their places, and he told me he gave them me<br>
freely, as a satisfaction for the cruelty he had used me with before;<br>
and the furniture of one room being finished and set up, he told me he<br>
would furnish one chamber for himself, and would come and be one of my<br>
lodgers, if I would give him leave.<br>
<br>
I told him he ought not to ask me leave, who had so much right to make<br>
himself welcome. So the house began to look in some tolerable figure,<br>
and clean; the garden also, in about a fortnight's work, began to look<br>
something less like a wilderness than it used to do; and he ordered me<br>
to put up a bill for letting rooms, reserving one for himself, to come<br>
to as he saw occasion.<br>
<br>
When all was done to his mind, as to placing the goods, he seemed very<br>
well pleased, and we dined together again of his own providing; and the<br>
upholsterer's man gone, after dinner he took me by the hand. &quot;Come now,<br>
madam,&quot; says he, &quot;you must show me your house&quot; (for he had a mind to see<br>
everything over again). &quot;No, sir,&quot; said I; &quot;but I'll go show you your<br>
house, if you please;&quot; so we went up through all the rooms, and in the<br>
room which was appointed for himself Amy was doing something. &quot;Well,<br>
Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;I intend to lie with you to-morrow night.&quot; &quot;To-night if<br>
you please, sir,&quot; says Amy very innocently; &quot;your room is quite ready.&quot;<br>
&quot;Well, Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;I am glad you are so willing.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I<br>
mean your chamber is ready to-night,&quot; and away she run out of the room,<br>
ashamed enough; for the girl meant no harm, whatever she had said to me<br>
in private.<br>
<br>
However, he said no more then; but when Amy was gone he walked about the<br>
room, and looked at everything, and taking me by the hand he kissed me,<br>
and spoke a great many kind, affectionate things to me indeed; as of his<br>
measures for my advantage, and what he would do to raise me again in the<br>
world; told me that my afflictions and the conduct I had shown in<br>
bearing them to such an extremity, had so engaged him to me that he<br>
valued me infinitely above all the women in the world; that though he<br>
was under such engagements that he could not marry me (his wife and he<br>
had been parted for some reasons, which make too long a story to<br>
intermix with mine), yet that he would be everything else that a woman<br>
could ask in a husband; and with that he kissed me again, and took me in<br>
his arms, but offered not the least uncivil action to me, and told me he<br>
hoped I would not deny him all the favours he should ask, because he<br>
resolved to ask nothing of me but what it was fit for a woman of virtue<br>
and modesty, for such he knew me to be, to yield.<br>
<br>
I confess the terrible pressure of my former misery, the memory of which<br>
lay heavy upon my mind, and the surprising kindness with which he had<br>
delivered me, and, withal, the expectations of what he might still do<br>
for me, were powerful things, and made me have scarce the power to deny<br>
him anything he would ask. However, I told him thus, with an air of<br>
tenderness too, that he had done so much for me that I thought I ought<br>
to deny him nothing; only I hoped and depended upon him that he would<br>
not take the advantage of the infinite obligations I was under to him,<br>
to desire anything of me the yielding to which would lay me lower in his<br>
esteem than I desired to be; that as I took him to be a man of honour,<br>
so I knew he could not like me better for doing anything that was below<br>
a woman of honesty and good manners to do.<br>
<br>
He told me that he had done all this for me, without so much as telling<br>
me what kindness or real affection he had for me, that I might not be<br>
under any necessity of yielding to him in anything for want of bread;<br>
and he would no more oppress my gratitude now than he would my necessity<br>
before, nor ask anything, supposing he would stop his favours or<br>
withdraw his kindness, if he was denied; it was true, he said, he might<br>
tell me more freely his mind now than before, seeing I had let him see<br>
that I accepted his assistance, and saw that he was sincere in his<br>
design of serving me; that he had gone thus far to show me that he was<br>
kind to me, but that now he would tell me that he loved me, and yet<br>
would demonstrate that his love was both honourable, and that what he<br>
should desire was what he might honestly ask and I might honestly grant.<br>
<br>
I answered that, within those two limitations, I was sure I ought to<br>
deny him nothing, and I should think myself not ungrateful only, but<br>
very unjust, if I should; so he said no more, but I observed he kissed<br>
me more, and took me in his arms in a kind of familiar way, more than<br>
usual, and which once or twice put me in mind of my maid Amy's words;<br>
and yet, I must acknowledge, I was so overcome with his goodness to me<br>
in those many kind things he had done that I not only was easy at what<br>
he did and made no resistance, but was inclined to do the like, whatever<br>
he had offered to do. But he went no farther than what I have said, nor<br>
did he offer so much as to sit down on the bedside with me, but took his<br>
leave, said he loved me tenderly, and would convince me of it by such<br>
demonstrations as should be to my satisfaction. I told him I had a great<br>
deal of reason to believe him, that he was full master of the whole<br>
house and of me, as far as was within the bounds we had spoken of, which<br>
I believe he would not break, and asked him if he would not lodge there<br>
that night.<br>
<br>
He said he could not well stay that night, business requiring him in<br>
London, but added, smiling, that he would come the next day and take a<br>
night's lodging with me. I pressed him to stay that night, and told him<br>
I should be glad a friend so valuable should be under the same roof with<br>
me; and indeed I began at that time not only to be much obliged to him,<br>
but to love him too, and that in a manner that I had not been acquainted<br>
with myself.<br>
<br>
Oh! let no woman slight the temptation that being generously delivered<br>
from trouble is to any spirit furnished with gratitude and just<br>
principles. This gentleman had freely and voluntarily delivered me from<br>
misery, from poverty, and rags; he had made me what I was, and put me<br>
into a way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to live happy and<br>
pleased, and on his bounty I depended. What could I say to this<br>
gentleman when he pressed me to yield to him, and argued the lawfulness<br>
of it? But of that in its place.<br>
<br>
I pressed him again to stay that night, and told him it was the first<br>
completely happy night that I had ever had in the house in my life, and<br>
I should be very sorry to have it be without his company, who was the<br>
cause and foundation of it all; that we would be innocently merry, but<br>
that it could never be without him; and, in short, I courted him so,<br>
that he said he could not deny me, but he would take his horse and go<br>
to London, do the business he had to do, which, it seems, was to pay a<br>
foreign bill that was due that night, and would else be protested, and<br>
that he would come back in three hours at farthest, and sup with me; but<br>
bade me get nothing there, for since I was resolved to be merry, which<br>
was what he desired above all things, he would send me something from<br>
London. &quot;And we will make it a wedding supper, my dear,&quot; says he; and<br>
with that word took me in his arms, and kissed me so vehemently that I<br>
made no question but he intended to do everything else that Amy had<br>
talked of.<br>
<br>
I started a little at the word wedding. &quot;What do ye mean, to call it by<br>
such a name?&quot; says I; adding, &quot;We will have a supper, but t'other is<br>
impossible, as well on your side as mine.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Well,&quot; says he,<br>
&quot;you shall call it what you will, but it may be the same thing, for I<br>
shall satisfy you it is not so impossible as you make it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand you,&quot; said I. &quot;Have not I a husband and you a wife?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well,&quot; says he, &quot;we will talk of that after supper;&quot; so he rose<br>
up, gave me another kiss, and took his horse for London.<br>
<br>
This kind of discourse had fired my blood, I confess, and I knew not<br>
what to think of it. It was plain now that he intended to lie with me,<br>
but how he would reconcile it to a legal thing, like a marriage, that I<br>
could not imagine. We had both of us used Amy with so much intimacy, and<br>
trusted her with everything, having such unexampled instances of her<br>
fidelity, that he made no scruple to kiss me and say all these things to<br>
me before her; nor had he cared one farthing, if I would have let him<br>
lie with me, to have had Amy there too all night. When he was gone,<br>
&quot;Well, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;what will all this come to now? I am all in a<br>
sweat at him.&quot; &quot;Come to, madam?&quot; says Amy. &quot;I see what it will come to;<br>
I must put you to bed to-night together.&quot; &quot;Why, you would not be so<br>
impudent, you jade you,&quot; says I, &quot;would you?&quot; &quot;Yes, I would,&quot; says she,<br>
&quot;with all my heart, and think you both as honest as ever you were in<br>
your lives.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What ails the slut to talk so?&quot; said I. &quot;Honest! How can it be honest?&quot;<br>
&quot;Why, I'll tell you, madam,&quot; says Amy; &quot;I sounded it as soon as I heard<br>
him speak, and it is very true too; he calls you widow, and such indeed<br>
you are; for, as my master has left you so many years, he is dead, to be<br>
sure; at least he is dead to you; he is no husband. You are, and ought<br>
to be, free to marry who you will; and his wife being gone from him, and<br>
refusing to lie with him, then he is a single man again as much as ever;<br>
and though you cannot bring the laws of the land to join you together,<br>
yet, one refusing to do the office of a wife, and the other of a<br>
husband, you may certainly take one another fairly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;if I could take him fairly, you may be sure I'd<br>
take him above all the men in the world; it turned the very heart within<br>
me when I heard him say he loved me. How could it be otherwise, when you<br>
know what a condition I was in before, despised and trampled on by all<br>
the world? I could have took him in my arms and kissed him as freely as<br>
he did me, if it had not been for shame.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, and all the rest too,&quot; says Amy, &quot;at the first word. I don't see<br>
how you can think of denying him anything. Has he not brought you out of<br>
the devil's clutches, brought you out of the blackest misery that ever<br>
poor lady was reduced to? Can a woman deny such a man anything?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, I don't know what to do, Amy,&quot; says I. &quot;I hope he won't desire<br>
anything of that kind of me; I hope he won't attempt it. If he does, I<br>
know not what to say to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not ask you!&quot; says Amy. &quot;Depend upon it, he will ask you, and you will<br>
grant it too. I am sure my mistress is no fool. Come, pray, madam, let<br>
me go air you a clean shift; don't let him find you in foul linen the<br>
wedding-night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But that I know you to be a very honest girl, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;you would<br>
make me abhor you. Why, you argue for the devil, as if you were one of<br>
his privy councillors.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's no matter for that, madam, I say nothing but what I think. You own<br>
you love this gentleman, and he has given you sufficient testimony of<br>
his affection to you; your conditions are alike unhappy, and he is of<br>
opinion that he may take another woman, his first wife having broke her<br>
honour, and living from him; and that though the laws of the land will<br>
not allow him to marry formally, yet that he may take another woman into<br>
his arms, provided he keeps true to the other woman as a wife; nay, he<br>
says it is usual to do so, and allowed by the custom of the place, in<br>
several countries abroad. And, I must own, I am of the same mind; else<br>
it is in the power of a whore, after she has jilted and abandoned her<br>
husband, to confine him from the pleasure as well as convenience of a<br>
woman all the days of his life, which would be very unreasonable, and,<br>
as times go, not tolerable to all people; and the like on your side,<br>
madam.&quot;<br>
<br>
Had I now had my senses about me, and had my reason not been overcome by<br>
the powerful attraction of so kind, so beneficent a friend; had I<br>
consulted conscience and virtue, I should have repelled this Amy,<br>
however faithful and honest to me in other things, as a viper and engine<br>
of the devil. I ought to have remembered that neither he or I, either<br>
by the laws of God or man, could come together upon any other terms<br>
than that of notorious adultery. The ignorant jade's argument, that he<br>
had brought me out of the hands of the devil, by which she meant the<br>
devil of poverty and distress, should have been a powerful motive to me<br>
not to plunge myself into the jaws of hell, and into the power of the<br>
real devil, in recompense for that deliverance. I should have looked<br>
upon all the good this man had done for me to have been the particular<br>
work of the goodness of Heaven, and that goodness should have moved me<br>
to a return of duty and humble obedience. I should have received the<br>
mercy thankfully, and applied it soberly, to the praise and honour of my<br>
Maker; whereas, by this wicked course, all the bounty and kindness of<br>
this gentleman became a snare to me, was a mere bait to the devil's<br>
hook; I received his kindness at the dear expense of body and soul,<br>
mortgaging faith, religion, conscience, and modesty for (as I may call<br>
it) a morsel of bread; or, if you will, ruined my soul from a principle<br>
of gratitude, and gave myself up to the devil, to show myself grateful<br>
to my benefactor. I must do the gentleman that justice as to say I<br>
verily believe that he did nothing but what he thought was lawful; and I<br>
must do that justice upon myself as to say I did what my own conscience<br>
convinced me, at the very time I did it, was horribly unlawful,<br>
scandalous, and abominable.<br>
<br>
But poverty was my snare; dreadful poverty! The misery I had been in was<br>
great, such as would make the heart tremble at the apprehensions of its<br>
return; and I might appeal to any that has had any experience of the<br>
world, whether one so entirely destitute as I was of all manner of all<br>
helps or friends, either to support me or to assist me to support<br>
myself, could withstand the proposal; not that I plead this as a<br>
justification of my conduct, but that it may move the pity even of those<br>
that abhor the crime.<br>
<br>
Besides this, I was young, handsome, and, with all the mortifications I<br>
had met with, was vain, and that not a little; and, as it was a new<br>
thing, so it was a pleasant thing to be courted, caressed, embraced, and<br>
high professions of affection made to me, by a man so agreeable and so<br>
able to do me good.<br>
<br>
Add to this, that if I had ventured to disoblige this gentleman, I had<br>
no friend in the world to have recourse to; I had no prospect--no, not<br>
of a bit of bread; I had nothing before me but to fall back into the<br>
same misery that I had been in before.<br>
<br>
Amy had but too much rhetoric in this cause; she represented all those<br>
things in their proper colours; she argued them all with her utmost<br>
skill; and at last the merry jade, when she came to dress me, &quot;Look ye,<br>
madam,&quot; said she, &quot;if you won't consent, tell him you will do as Rachel<br>
did to Jacob, when she could have no children--put her maid to bed to<br>
him; tell him you cannot comply with him, but there's Amy, he may ask<br>
her the question; she has promised me she won't deny you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And would you have me say so, Amy?&quot; said I.<br>
<br>
&quot;No, madam; but I would really have you do so. Besides, you are undone<br>
if you do not; and if my doing it would save you from being undone, as I<br>
said before, he shall, if he will; if he asks me, I won't deny him, not<br>
I; hang me if I do,&quot; says Amy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, I know not what to do,&quot; says I to Amy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Do!&quot; says Amy. &quot;Your choice is fair and plain. Here you may have a<br>
handsome, charming gentleman, be rich, live pleasantly and in plenty, or<br>
refuse him, and want a dinner, go in rags, live in tears; in short, beg<br>
and starve. You know this is the case, madam,&quot; says Amy. &quot;I wonder how<br>
you can say you know not what to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;the case is as you say, and I think verily I must<br>
yield to him; but then,&quot; said I, moved by conscience, &quot;don't talk any<br>
more of your cant of its being lawful that I ought to marry again, and<br>
that he ought to marry again, and such stuff as that; 'tis all<br>
nonsense,&quot; says I, &quot;Amy, there's nothing in it; let me hear no more of<br>
that, for if I yield, 'tis in vain to mince the matter, I am a whore,<br>
Amy; neither better nor worse, I assure you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think so, madam, by no means,&quot; says Amy. &quot;I wonder how you can<br>
talk so;&quot; and then she run on with her argument of the unreasonableness<br>
that a woman should be obliged to live single, or a man to live single,<br>
in such cases as before. &quot;Well, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;come, let us dispute no<br>
more, for the longer I enter into that part, the greater my scruples<br>
will be; but if I let it alone, the necessity of my present<br>
circumstances is such that I believe I shall yield to him, if he should<br>
importune me much about it; but I should be glad he would not do it at<br>
all, but leave me as I am.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As to that, madam, you may depend,&quot; says Amy, &quot;he expects to have you<br>
for his bedfellow to-night. I saw it plainly in his management all day;<br>
and at last he told you so too, as plain, I think, as he could.&quot; &quot;Well,<br>
well, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;I don't know what to say; if he will he must, I<br>
think; I don't know how to resist such a man, that has done so much for<br>
me.&quot; &quot;I don't know how you should,&quot; says Amy.<br>
<br>
Thus Amy and I canvassed the business between us; the jade prompted the<br>
crime which I had but too much inclination to commit, that is to say,<br>
not as a crime, for I had nothing of the vice in my constitution; my<br>
spirits were far from being high, my blood had no fire in it to kindle<br>
the flame of desire; but the kindness and good humour of the man and<br>
the dread of my own circumstances concurred to bring me to the point,<br>
and I even resolved, before he asked, to give up my virtue to him<br>
whenever he should put it to the question.<br>
<br>
In this I was a double offender, whatever he was, for I was resolved to<br>
commit the crime, knowing and owning it to be a crime; he, if it was<br>
true as he said, was fully persuaded it was lawful, and in that<br>
persuasion he took the measures and used all the circumlocutions which I<br>
am going to speak of.<br>
<br>
About two hours after he was gone, came a Leadenhall basket-woman, with<br>
a whole load of good things for the mouth (the particulars are not to<br>
the purpose), and brought orders to get supper by eight o'clock.<br>
However, I did not intend to begin to dress anything till I saw him; and<br>
he gave me time enough, for he came before seven, so that Amy, who had<br>
gotten one to help her, got everything ready in time.<br>
<br>
We sat down to supper about eight, and were indeed very merry. Amy made<br>
us some sport, for she was a girl of spirit and wit, and with her talk<br>
she made us laugh very often, and yet the jade managed her wit with all<br>
the good manners imaginable.<br>
<br>
But to shorten the story. After supper he took me up into his chamber,<br>
where Amy had made a good fire, and there he pulled out a great many<br>
papers, and spread them upon a little table, and then took me by the<br>
hand, and after kissing me very much, he entered into a discourse of his<br>
circumstances and of mine, how they agreed in several things exactly;<br>
for example, that I was abandoned of a husband in the prime of my youth<br>
and vigour, and he of a wife in his middle age; how the end of marriage<br>
was destroyed by the treatment we had either of us received, and it<br>
would be very hard that we should be tied by the formality of the<br>
contract where the essence of it was destroyed. I interrupted him, and<br>
told him there was a vast difference between our circumstances, and that<br>
in the most essential part, namely, that he was rich, and I was poor;<br>
that he was above the world, and I infinitely below it; that his<br>
circumstances were very easy, mine miserable, and this was an inequality<br>
the most essential that could be imagined. &quot;As to that, my dear,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;I have taken such measures as shall make an equality still;&quot; and<br>
with that he showed me a contract in writing, wherein he engaged himself<br>
to me to cohabit constantly with me, to provide for me in all respects<br>
as a wife, and repeating in the preamble a long account of the nature<br>
and reason of our living together, and an obligation in the penalty of<br>
&pound;7000 never to abandon me; and at last showed me a bond for &pound;500, to be<br>
paid to me, or to my assigns, within three months after his death.<br>
<br>
He read over all these things to me, and then, in a most moving,<br>
affectionate manner, and in words not to be answered, he said, &quot;Now, my<br>
dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object anything against it? If<br>
not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this matter no<br>
longer.&quot; With that he pulled out a silk purse, which had threescore<br>
guineas in it, and threw them into my lap, and concluded all the rest of<br>
his discourse with kisses and protestations of his love, of which indeed<br>
I had abundant proof.<br>
<br>
Pity human frailty, you that read of a woman reduced in her youth and<br>
prime to the utmost misery and distress, and raised again, as above, by<br>
the unexpected and surprising bounty of a stranger; I say, pity her if<br>
she was not able, after all these things, to make any more resistance.<br>
<br>
However, I stood out a little longer still. I asked him how he could<br>
expect that I could come into a proposal of such consequence the very<br>
first time it was moved to me; and that I ought, if I consented to it,<br>
to capitulate with him that he should never upbraid me with easiness and<br>
consenting too soon. He said no; but, on the contrary, he would take it<br>
as a mark of the greatest kindness I could show him. Then he went on to<br>
give reasons why there was no occasion to use the ordinary ceremony of<br>
delay, or to wait a reasonable time of courtship, which was only to<br>
avoid scandal; but, as this was private, it had nothing of that nature<br>
in it; that he had been courting me some time by the best of courtship,<br>
viz., doing acts of kindness to me; and that he had given testimonies of<br>
his sincere affection to me by deeds, not by flattering trifles and the<br>
usual courtship of words, which were often found to have very little<br>
meaning; that he took me, not as a mistress, but as his wife, and<br>
protested it was clear to him he might lawfully do it, and that I was<br>
perfectly at liberty, and assured me, by all that it was possible for an<br>
honest man to say, that he would treat me as his wife as long as he<br>
lived. In a word, he conquered all the little resistance I intended to<br>
make; he protested he loved me above all the world, and begged I would<br>
for once believe him; that he had never deceived me, and never would,<br>
but would make it his study to make my life comfortable and happy, and<br>
to make me forget the misery I had gone through. I stood still a while,<br>
and said nothing; but seeing him eager for my answer, I smiled, and<br>
looking up at him, &quot;And must I, then,&quot; says I, &quot;say yes at first asking?<br>
Must I depend upon your promise? Why, then,&quot; said I, &quot;upon the faith of<br>
that promise, and in the sense of that inexpressible kindness you have<br>
shown me, you shall be obliged, and I will be wholly yours to the end of<br>
my life;&quot; and with that I took his hand, which held me by the hand, and<br>
gave it a kiss.<br>
<br>
And thus, in gratitude for the favours I received from a man, was all<br>
sense of religion and duty to God, all regard to virtue and honour,<br>
given up at once, and we were to call one another man and wife, who, in<br>
the sense of the laws both of God and our country, were no more than two<br>
adulterers; in short, a whore and a rogue. Nor, as I have said above,<br>
was my conscience silent in it, though it seems his was; for I sinned<br>
with open eyes, and thereby had a double guilt upon me. As I always<br>
said, his notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the<br>
opinion, or argued himself into it now, that we were both free and might<br>
lawfully marry.<br>
<br>
But I was quite of another side--nay, and my judgment was right, but my<br>
circumstances were my temptation; the terrors behind me looked blacker<br>
than the terrors before me; and the dreadful argument of wanting bread,<br>
and being run into the horrible distresses I was in before, mastered all<br>
my resolution, and I gave myself up as above.<br>
<br>
The rest of the evening we spent very agreeably to me; he was perfectly<br>
good-humoured, and was at that time very merry. Then he made Amy dance<br>
with him, and I told him I would put Amy to bed to him. Amy said, with<br>
all her heart; she never had been a bride in her life. In short, he made<br>
the girl so merry that, had he not been to lie with me the same night,<br>
I believe he would have played the fool with Amy for half-an-hour, and<br>
the girl would no more have refused him than I intended to do. Yet<br>
before, I had always found her a very modest wench as any I ever saw in<br>
all my life; but, in short, the mirth of that night, and a few more such<br>
afterwards, ruined the girl's modesty for ever, as shall appear<br>
by-and-by, in its place.<br>
<br>
So far does fooling and toying sometimes go that I know nothing a young<br>
woman has to be more cautious of; so far had this innocent girl gone in<br>
jesting between her and I, and in talking that she would let him lie<br>
with her, if he would but be kinder to me, that at last she let him lie<br>
with her in earnest; and so empty was I now of all principle, that I<br>
encouraged the doing it almost before my face.<br>
<br>
I say but too justly that I was empty of principle, because, as above, I<br>
had yielded to him, not as deluded to believe it lawful, but as overcome<br>
by his kindness, and terrified at the fear of my own misery if he should<br>
leave me. So with my eyes open, and with my conscience, as I may say,<br>
awake, I sinned, knowing it to be a sin, but having no power to resist.<br>
When this had thus made a hole in my heart, and I was come to such a<br>
height as to transgress against the light of my own conscience, I was<br>
then fit for any wickedness, and conscience left off speaking where it<br>
found it could not be heard.<br>
<br>
But to return to our story. Having consented, as above, to his proposal,<br>
we had not much more to do. He gave me my writings, and the bond for my<br>
maintenance during his life, and for five hundred pounds after his<br>
death. And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards,<br>
that two years after we were thus, as he called it, married, he made his<br>
will, and gave me a thousand pounds more, and all my household stuff,<br>
plate, &amp;c., which was considerable too.<br>
<br>
Amy put us to bed, and my new friend--I cannot call him husband--was so<br>
well pleased with Amy for her fidelity and kindness to me that he paid<br>
her all the arrear of her wages that I owed her, and gave her five<br>
guineas over; and had it gone no farther, Amy had richly deserved what<br>
she had, for never was a maid so true to her mistress in such dreadful<br>
circumstances as I was in. Nor was what followed more her own fault than<br>
mine, who led her almost into it at first, and quite into it at last;<br>
and this may be a farther testimony what a hardness of crime I was now<br>
arrived to, which was owing to the conviction, that was from the<br>
beginning upon me, that I was a whore, not a wife; nor could I ever<br>
frame my mouth to call him husband or to say &quot;my husband&quot; when I was<br>
speaking of him.<br>
<br>
We lived, surely, the most agreeable life, the grand exception only<br>
excepted, that ever two lived together. He was the most obliging,<br>
gentlemanly man, and the most tender of me, that ever woman gave herself<br>
up to. Nor was there ever the least interruption to our mutual kindness,<br>
no, not to the last day of his life. But I must bring Amy's disaster in<br>
at once, that I may have done with her.<br>
<br>
Amy was dressing me one morning, for now I had two maids, and Amy was my<br>
chambermaid. &quot;Dear madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;what! a'nt you with child yet?&quot;<br>
&quot;No, Amy,&quot; says I; &quot;nor any sign of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Law, madam!&quot; says Amy, &quot;what have you been doing? Why, you have been<br>
married a year and a half. I warrant you master would have got me with<br>
child twice in that time.&quot; &quot;It may be so, Amy,&quot; says I. &quot;Let him try,<br>
can't you?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says Amy; &quot;you'll forbid it now. Before, I told you he<br>
should, with all my heart; but I won't now, now he's all your own.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; says I, &quot;Amy, I'll freely give you my consent. It will be nothing<br>
at all to me. Nay, I'll put you to bed to him myself one night or other,<br>
if you are willing.&quot; &quot;No, madam, no,&quot; says Amy, &quot;not now he's yours.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, you fool you,&quot; says I, &quot;don't I tell you I'll put you to bed to<br>
him myself?&quot; &quot;Nay, nay,&quot; says Amy, &quot;if you put me to bed to him, that's<br>
another case; I believe I shall not rise again very soon.&quot; &quot;I'll venture<br>
that, Amy,&quot; says I.<br>
<br>
After supper that night, and before we were risen from table, I said to<br>
him, Amy being by, &quot;Hark ye, Mr. ----, do you know that you are to lie<br>
with Amy to-night?&quot; &quot;No, not I,&quot; says he; but turns to Amy, &quot;Is it so,<br>
Amy?&quot; says he. &quot;No, sir,&quot; says she. &quot;Nay, don't say no, you fool; did<br>
not I promise to put you to bed to him?&quot; But the girl said &quot;No,&quot; still,<br>
and it passed off.<br>
<br>
At night, when we came to go to bed, Amy came into the chamber to<br>
undress me, and her master slipped into bed first; then I began, and<br>
told him all that Amy had said about my not being with child, and of her<br>
being with child twice in that time. &quot;Ay, Mrs. Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;I believe<br>
so too. Come hither, and, we'll try.&quot; But Amy did not go. &quot;Go, you<br>
fool,&quot; says I, &quot;can't you? I freely give you both leave.&quot; But Amy would<br>
not go. &quot;Nay, you whore,&quot; says I, &quot;you said, if I would put you to bed,<br>
you would with all your heart.&quot; And with that I sat her down, pulled off<br>
her stockings and shoes, and all her clothes piece by piece, and led her<br>
to the bed to him. &quot;Here,&quot; says I, &quot;try what you can do with your maid<br>
Amy.&quot; She pulled back a little, would not let me pull off her clothes at<br>
first, but it was hot weather, and she had not many clothes on, and<br>
particularly no stays on; and at last, when she saw I was in earnest,<br>
she let me do what I would. So I fairly stripped her, and then I threw<br>
open the bed and thrust her in.<br>
<br>
I need say no more. This is enough to convince anybody that I did not<br>
think him my husband, and that I had cast off all principle and all<br>
modesty, and had effectually stifled conscience.<br>
<br>
Amy, I dare say, began now to repent, and would fain have got out of bed<br>
again; but he said to her, &quot;Nay, Amy, you see your mistress has put you<br>
to bed; 'tis all her doing; you must blame her.&quot; So he held her fast,<br>
and the wench being naked in the bed with him, it was too late to look<br>
back, so she lay still and let him do what he would with her.<br>
<br>
Had I looked upon myself as a wife, you cannot suppose I would have been<br>
willing to have let my husband lie with my maid, much less before my<br>
face, for I stood by all the while; but as I thought myself a whore, I<br>
cannot say but that it was something designed in my thoughts that my<br>
maid should be a whore too, and should not reproach me with it.<br>
<br>
Amy, however, less vicious than I, was grievously out of sorts the next<br>
morning, and cried and took on most vehemently, that she was ruined and<br>
undone, and there was no pacifying her; she was a whore, a slut, and she<br>
was undone! undone! and cried almost all day. I did all I could to<br>
pacify her. &quot;A whore!&quot; says I. &quot;Well, and am not I a whore as well as<br>
you?&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; says Amy; &quot;no, you are not, for you are married.&quot; &quot;Not<br>
I, Amy,&quot; says I; &quot;I do not pretend to it. He may marry you to-morrow,<br>
if he will, for anything I could do to hinder it. I am not married. I do<br>
not look upon it as anything.&quot; Well, all did not pacify Amy, but she<br>
cried two or three days about it; but it wore off by degrees.<br>
<br>
But the case differed between Amy and her master exceedingly; for Amy<br>
retained the same kind temper she always had; but, on the contrary, he<br>
was quite altered, for he hated her heartily, and could, I believe, have<br>
killed her after it, and he told me so, for he thought this a vile<br>
action; whereas what he and I had done he was perfectly easy in, thought<br>
it just, and esteemed me as much his wife as if we had been married from<br>
our youth, and had neither of us known any other; nay, he loved me, I<br>
believe, as entirely as if I had been the wife of his youth. Nay, he<br>
told me it was true, in one sense, that he had two wives, but that I was<br>
the wife of his affection, the other the wife of his aversion.<br>
<br>
I was extremely concerned at the aversion he had taken to my maid Amy,<br>
and used my utmost skill to get it altered; for though he had, indeed,<br>
debauched the wench, I knew that I was the principal occasion of it; and<br>
as he was the best-humoured man in the world, I never gave him over till<br>
I prevailed with him to be easy with her, and as I was now become the<br>
devil's agent, to make others as wicked as myself, I brought him to lie<br>
with her again several times after that, till at last, as the poor girl<br>
said, so it happened, and she was really with child.<br>
<br>
She was terribly concerned at it, and so was he too. &quot;Come, my dear,&quot;<br>
says I, &quot;when Rachel put her handmaid to bed to Jacob, she took the<br>
children as her own. Don't be uneasy; I'll take the child as my own. Had<br>
not I a hand in the frolic of putting her to bed to you? It was my fault<br>
as much as yours.&quot; So I called Amy, and encouraged her too, and told her<br>
that I would take care of the child and her too, and added the same<br>
argument to her. &quot;For,&quot; says I, &quot;Amy, it was all my fault. Did not I<br>
drag your clothes off your back, and put you to bed to him?&quot; Thus I,<br>
that had, indeed, been the cause of all the wickedness between them,<br>
encouraged them both, when they had any remorse about it, and rather<br>
prompted them to go on with it than to repent it.<br>
<br>
When Amy grew big she went to a place I had provided for her, and the<br>
neighbours knew nothing but that Amy and I was parted. She had a fine<br>
child indeed, a daughter, and we had it nursed; and Amy came again in<br>
about half a year to live with her old mistress; but neither my<br>
gentleman, or Amy either, cared for playing that game over again; for,<br>
as he said, the jade might bring him a houseful of children to keep.<br>
<br>
We lived as merrily and as happily after this as could be expected,<br>
considering our circumstances; I mean as to the pretended marriage, &amp;c.;<br>
and as to that, my gentleman had not the least concern about him for it.<br>
But as much as I was hardened, and that was as much as I believe ever<br>
any wicked creature was, yet I could not help it, there was and would be<br>
hours of intervals and of dark reflections which came involuntarily in,<br>
and thrust in sighs into the middle of all my songs; and there would be<br>
sometimes a heaviness of heart which intermingled itself with all my<br>
joy, and which would often fetch a tear from my eye. And let others<br>
pretend what they will, I believe it impossible to be otherwise with<br>
anybody. There can be no substantial satisfaction in a life of known<br>
wickedness; conscience will, and does often, break in upon them at<br>
particular times, let them do what they can to prevent it.<br>
<br>
But I am not to preach, but to relate; and whatever loose reflections<br>
were, and how often soever those dark intervals came on, I did my utmost<br>
to conceal them from him; ay, and to suppress and smother them too in<br>
myself; and, to outward appearance, we lived as cheerfully and agreeably<br>
as it was possible for any couple in the world to live.<br>
<br>
After I had thus lived with him something above two years, truly I found<br>
myself with child too. My gentleman was mightily pleased at it, and<br>
nothing could be kinder than he was in the preparations he made for me,<br>
and for my lying-in, which was, however, very private, because I cared<br>
for as little company as possible; nor had I kept up my neighbourly<br>
acquaintance, so that I had nobody to invite upon such an occasion.<br>
<br>
I was brought to bed very well (of a daughter too, as well as Amy), but<br>
the child died at about six weeks old, so all that work was to do over<br>
again--that is to say, the charge, the expense, the travail, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The next year I made him amends, and brought him a son, to his great<br>
satisfaction. It was a charming child, and did very well. After this my<br>
husband, as he called himself, came to me one evening, and told me he<br>
had a very difficult thing happened to him, which he knew not what to do<br>
in, or how to resolve about, unless I would make him easy; this was,<br>
that his occasions required him to go over to France for about two<br>
months.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; says I, &quot;and how shall I make you easy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, by consenting to let me go,&quot; says he; &quot;upon which condition, I'll<br>
tell you the occasion of my going, that you may judge of the necessity<br>
there is for it on my side.&quot; Then, to make me easy in his going, he told<br>
me he would make his will before he went, which should be to my full<br>
satisfaction.<br>
<br>
I told him the last part was so kind that I could not decline the first<br>
part, unless he would give me leave to add that, if it was not for<br>
putting him to an extraordinary expense, I would go over along with him.<br>
<br>
He was so pleased with this offer that he told me he would give me full<br>
satisfaction for it, and accept of it too; so he took me to London with<br>
him the next day, and there he made his will, and showed it to me, and<br>
sealed it before proper witnesses, and then gave it to me to keep. In<br>
this will he gave a thousand pounds to a person that we both knew very<br>
well, in trust, to pay it, with the interest from the time of his<br>
decease, to me or my assigns; then he willed the payment of my jointure,<br>
as he called it, viz., his bond of five hundred pounds after his death;<br>
also, he gave me all my household stuff, plate, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
This was a most engaging thing for a man to do to one under my<br>
circumstances; and it would have been hard, as I told him, to deny him<br>
anything, or to refuse to go with him anywhere. So we settled everything<br>
as well as we could, left Amy in charge with the house, and for his<br>
other business, which was in jewels, he had two men he intrusted, who he<br>
had good security for, and who managed for him, and corresponded with<br>
him.<br>
<br>
Things being thus concerted, we went away to France, arrived safe at<br>
Calais, and by easy journeys came in eight days more to Paris, where we<br>
lodged in the house of an English merchant of his acquaintance, and was<br>
very courteously entertained.<br>
<br>
My gentleman's business was with some persons of the first rank, and to<br>
whom he had sold some jewels of very good value, and received a great<br>
sum of money in specie; and, as he told me privately, he gained three<br>
thousand pistoles by his bargain, but would not suffer the most intimate<br>
friend he had there to know what he had received; for it is not so safe<br>
a thing in Paris to have a great sum of money in keeping as it might be<br>
in London.<br>
<br>
We made this journey much longer than we intended, and my gentleman sent<br>
for one of his managers in London to come over to us in Paris with some<br>
diamonds, and sent him back to London again to fetch more. Then other<br>
business fell into his hands so unexpectedly that I began to think we<br>
should take up our constant residence there, which I was not very averse<br>
to, it being my native country, and I spoke the language perfectly well.<br>
So we took a good house in Paris, and lived very well there; and I sent<br>
for Amy to come over to me, for I lived gallantly, and my gentleman was<br>
two or three times going to keep me a coach, but I declined it,<br>
especially at Paris, but as they have those conveniences by the day<br>
there, at a certain rate, I had an equipage provided for me whenever I<br>
pleased, and I lived here in a very good figure, and might have lived<br>
higher if I pleased.<br>
<br>
But in the middle of all this felicity a dreadful disaster befell me,<br>
which entirely unhinged all my affairs, and threw me back into the same<br>
state of life that I was in before; with this one happy exception,<br>
however, that whereas before I was poor, even to misery, now I was not<br>
only provided for, but very rich.<br>
<br>
My gentleman had the name in Paris for a rich man, and indeed he was so,<br>
though not so immensely rich as people imagined; but that which was<br>
fatal to him was, that he generally carried a shagreen case in his<br>
pocket, especially when he went to court, or to the houses of any of the<br>
princes of the blood, in which he had jewels of very great value.<br>
<br>
It happened one day that, being to go to Versailles to wait upon the<br>
Prince of ----, he came up into my chamber in the morning, and laid out<br>
his jewel-case, because he was not going to show any jewels, but to get<br>
a foreign bill accepted, which he had received from Amsterdam; so, when<br>
he gave me the case, he said, &quot;My dear, I think I need not carry this<br>
with me, because it may be I may not come back till night, and it is too<br>
much to venture.&quot; I returned, &quot;Then, my dear, you shan't go.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot;<br>
says he. &quot;Because, as they are too much for you, so you are too much for<br>
me to venture, and you shall not go, unless you will promise me not to<br>
stay so as to come back in the night.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope there's no danger,&quot; said he, &quot;seeing that I have nothing about<br>
me of any value; and therefore, lest I should, take that too,&quot; says he,<br>
and gives me his gold watch and a rich diamond which he had in a ring,<br>
and always wore on his finger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, but, my dear,&quot; says I, &quot;you make me more uneasy now than before;<br>
for if you apprehend no danger, why do you use this caution? and if you<br>
apprehend there is danger, why do you go at all?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;There is no danger,&quot; says he, &quot;if I do not stay late, and I do not<br>
design to do so.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, but promise me, then, that you won't,&quot; says I, &quot;or else I cannot<br>
let you go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I won't indeed, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;unless I am obliged to it. I assure<br>
you I do not intend it; but if I should, I am not worth robbing now, for<br>
I have nothing about me but about six pistoles in my little purse and<br>
that little ring,&quot; showing me a small diamond ring, worth about ten or<br>
twelve pistoles, which he put upon his finger, in the room of the rich<br>
one he usually wore.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: THE JEWELLER IS ABOUT TO LEAVE FOR VERSAILLES<br>
<br>
_And gives me his gold watch and a rich diamond which he had in a ring,<br>
and always wore on his finger_]<br>
<br>
I still pressed him not to stay late, and he said he would not. &quot;But if<br>
I am kept late,&quot; says he, &quot;beyond my expectation, I'll stay all night,<br>
and come next morning.&quot; This seemed a very good caution; but still my<br>
mind was very uneasy about him, and I told him so, and entreated him<br>
not to go. I told him I did not know what might be the reason, but that<br>
I had a strange terror upon my mind about his going, and that if he did<br>
go, I was persuaded some harm would attend him. He smiled, and returned,<br>
&quot;Well, my dear, if it should be so, you are now richly provided for; all<br>
that I have here I give to you.&quot; And with that he takes up the casket or<br>
case, &quot;Here,&quot; says he, &quot;hold your hand; there is a good estate for you<br>
in this case; if anything happens to me 'tis all your own. I give it<br>
you for yourself;&quot; and with that he put the casket, the fine ring, and<br>
his gold watch all into my hands, and the key of his scrutoire besides,<br>
adding, &quot;And in my scrutoire there is some money; it is all your own.&quot;<br>
<br>
I stared at him as if I was frighted, for I thought all his face looked<br>
like a death's-head; and then immediately I thought I perceived his head<br>
all bloody, and then his clothes looked bloody too, and immediately it<br>
all went off, and he looked as he really did. Immediately I fell<br>
a-crying, and hung about him. &quot;My dear,&quot; said I, &quot;I am frighted to<br>
death; you shall not go. Depend upon it some mischief will befall you.&quot;<br>
I did not tell him how my vapourish fancy had represented him to me;<br>
that, I thought, was not proper. Besides, he would only have laughed at<br>
me, and would have gone away with a jest about it; but I pressed him<br>
seriously not to go that day, or, if he did, to promise me to come home<br>
to Paris again by daylight. He looked a little graver then than he did<br>
before, told me he was not apprehensive of the least danger, but if<br>
there was, he would either take care to come in the day, or, as he had<br>
said before, would stay all night.<br>
<br>
But all these promises came to nothing, for he was set upon in the open<br>
day and robbed by three men on horseback, masked, as he went; and one of<br>
them, who, it seems, rifled him while the rest stood to stop the coach,<br>
stabbed him into the body with a sword, so that he died immediately. He<br>
had a footman behind the coach, who they knocked down with the stock or<br>
butt-end of a carbine. They were supposed to kill him because of the<br>
disappointment they met with in not getting his case or casket of<br>
diamonds, which they knew he carried about him; and this was supposed<br>
because, after they had killed him, they made the coachman drive out of<br>
the road a long way over the heath, till they came to a convenient<br>
place, where they pulled him out of the coach and searched his clothes<br>
more narrowly than they could do while he was alive. But they found<br>
nothing but his little ring, six pistoles, and the value of about seven<br>
livres in small moneys.<br>
<br>
This was a dreadful blow to me, though I cannot say I was so surprised<br>
as I should otherwise have been, for all the while he was gone my mind<br>
was oppressed with the weight of my own thoughts, and I was as sure<br>
that I should never see him any more that I think nothing could be like<br>
it. The impression was so strong that I think nothing could make so deep<br>
a wound that was imaginary; and I was so dejected and disconsolate that,<br>
when I received the news of his disaster, there was no room for any<br>
extraordinary alteration in me. I had cried all that day, ate nothing,<br>
and only waited, as I might say, to receive the dismal news, which I had<br>
brought to me about five o'clock in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
I was in a strange country, and, though I had a pretty many<br>
acquaintances, had but very few friends that I could consult on this<br>
occasion. All possible inquiry was made after the rogues that had been<br>
thus barbarous, but nothing could be heard of them; nor was it possible<br>
that the footman could make any discovery of them by his description,<br>
for they knocked him down immediately, so that he knew nothing of what<br>
was done afterwards. The coachman was the only man that could say<br>
anything, and all his account amounted to no more than this, that one of<br>
them had soldier's clothes, but he could not remember the particulars of<br>
his mounting, so as to know what regiment he belonged to; and as to<br>
their faces, that he could know nothing of, because they had all of them<br>
masks on.<br>
<br>
I had him buried as decently as the place would permit a Protestant<br>
stranger to be buried, and made some of the scruples and difficulties on<br>
that account easy by the help of money to a certain person, who went<br>
impudently to the curate of the parish of St. Sulpitius, in Paris, and<br>
told him that the gentleman that was killed was a Catholic; that the<br>
thieves had taken from him a cross of gold, set with diamonds, worth six<br>
thousand livres; that his widow was a Catholic, and had sent by him<br>
sixty crowns to the church of ----, for masses to be said for the repose<br>
of his soul. Upon all which, though not one word was true, he was buried<br>
with all the ceremonies of the Roman Church.<br>
<br>
I think I almost cried myself to death for him, for I abandoned myself<br>
to all the excesses of grief; and indeed I loved him to a degree<br>
inexpressible; and considering what kindness he had shown me at first,<br>
and how tenderly he had used me to the last, what could I do less?<br>
<br>
Then the manner of his death was terrible and frightful to me, and,<br>
above all, the strange notices I had of it. I had never pretended to the<br>
second-sight, or anything of that kind, but certainly, if any one ever<br>
had such a thing, I had it at this time, for I saw him as plainly in all<br>
those terrible shapes as above; first, as a skeleton, not dead only, but<br>
rotten and wasted; secondly, as killed, and his face bloody; and,<br>
thirdly, his clothes bloody, and all within the space of one minute, or<br>
indeed of a very few moments.<br>
<br>
These things amazed me, and I was a good while as one stupid. However,<br>
after some time I began to recover, and look into my affairs. I had the<br>
satisfaction not to be left in distress, or in danger of poverty. On the<br>
contrary, besides what he had put into my hands fairly in his lifetime,<br>
which amounted to a very considerable value, I found above seven hundred<br>
pistoles in gold in his scrutoire, of which he had given me the key; and<br>
I found foreign bills accepted for about twelve thousand livres; so<br>
that, in a word, I found myself possessed of almost ten thousand pounds<br>
sterling in a very few days after the disaster.<br>
<br>
The first thing I did upon this occasion was to send a letter to my<br>
maid, as I still called her, Amy, wherein I gave her an account of my<br>
disaster, how my husband, as she called him (for I never called him so),<br>
was murdered; and as I did not know how his relations, or his wife's<br>
friends might act upon that occasion, I ordered her to convey away all<br>
the plate, linen, and other things of value, and to secure them in a<br>
person's hands that I directed her to, and then to sell or dispose of<br>
the furniture of the house, if she could, and so, without acquainting<br>
anybody with the reason of her going, withdraw; sending notice to his<br>
head manager at London that the house was quitted by the tenant, and<br>
they might come and take possession of it for the executors. Amy was so<br>
dexterous, and did her work so nimbly, that she gutted the house, and<br>
sent the key to the said manager, almost as soon as he had notice of the<br>
misfortune that befell their master.<br>
<br>
Upon their receiving the surprising news of his death, the head manager<br>
came over to Paris, and came to the house. I made no scruple of calling<br>
myself Madame ----, the widow of Monsieur ----, the English jeweller.<br>
And as I spoke French naturally, I did not let him know but that I was<br>
his wife, married in France, and that I had not heard that he had any<br>
wife in England, but pretended to be surprised, and exclaim against him<br>
for so base an action; and that I had good friends in Poictou, where I<br>
was born, who would take care to have justice done me in England out of<br>
his estate.<br>
<br>
I should have observed that, as soon as the news was public of a man<br>
being murdered, and that he was a jeweller, fame did me the favour as to<br>
publish presently that he was robbed of his casket of jewels, which he<br>
always carried about him. I confirmed this, among my daily lamentations<br>
for his disaster, and added that he had with him a fine diamond ring,<br>
which he was known to wear frequently about him, valued at one hundred<br>
pistoles, a gold watch, and a great quantity of diamonds of inestimable<br>
value in his casket, which jewels he was carrying to the Prince of<br>
----, to show some of them to him; and the prince owned that he had<br>
spoken to him to bring some such jewels, to let him see them. But I<br>
sorely repented this part afterward, as you shall hear.<br>
<br>
This rumour put an end to all inquiry after his jewels, his ring, or his<br>
watch; and as for the seven hundred pistoles, that I secured. For the<br>
bills which were in hand, I owned I had them, but that, as I said I<br>
brought my husband thirty thousand livres portion, I claimed the said<br>
bills, which came to not above twelve thousand livres, for my _amende_;<br>
and this, with the plate and the household stuff, was the principal of<br>
all his estate which they could come at. As to the foreign bill which he<br>
was going to Versailles to get accepted, it was really lost with him;<br>
but his manager, who had remitted the bill to him, by way of Amsterdam,<br>
bringing over the second bill, the money was saved, as they call it,<br>
which would otherwise have been also gone; the thieves who robbed and<br>
murdered him were, to be sure, afraid to send anybody to get the bill<br>
accepted, for that would undoubtedly have discovered them.<br>
<br>
By this time my maid Amy was arrived, and she gave me an account of her<br>
management, and how she had secured everything, and that she had quitted<br>
the house, and sent the key to the head manager of his business, and<br>
let me know how much she had made of everything very punctually and<br>
honestly.<br>
<br>
I should have observed, in the account of his dwelling with me so long<br>
at ----, that he never passed for anything there but a lodger in the<br>
house; and though he was landlord, that did not alter the case. So that<br>
at his death, Amy coming to quit the house and give them the key, there<br>
was no affinity between that and the case of their master who was newly<br>
killed.<br>
<br>
I got good advice at Paris from an eminent lawyer, a counsellor of the<br>
Parliament there, and laying my case before him, he directed me to make<br>
a process in dower upon the estate, for making good my new fortune upon<br>
matrimony, which accordingly I did; and, upon the whole, the manager<br>
went back to England well satisfied that he had gotten the unaccepted<br>
bill of exchange, which was for two thousand five hundred pounds, with<br>
some other things, which together amounted to seventeen thousand livres;<br>
and thus I got rid of him.<br>
<br>
I was visited with great civility on this sad occasion of the loss of my<br>
husband, as they thought him, by a great many ladies of quality. And the<br>
Prince of ----, to whom it was reported he was carrying the jewels, sent<br>
his gentleman with a very handsome compliment of condolence to me; and<br>
his gentleman, whether with or without order, hinted as if his Highness<br>
did intend to have visited me himself, but that some accident, which he<br>
made a long story of, had prevented him.<br>
<br>
By the concourse of ladies and others that thus came to visit me, I<br>
began to be much known; and as I did not forget to set myself out with<br>
all possible advantage, considering the dress of a widow, which in those<br>
days was a most frightful thing; I say, as I did thus from my own<br>
vanity, for I was not ignorant that I was very handsome; I say, on this<br>
account I was soon made very public, and was known by the name of _La<br>
belle veufeu de Poictou_, or the pretty widow of Poictou. As I was very<br>
well pleased to see myself thus handsomely used in my affliction, it<br>
soon dried up all my tears; and though I appeared as a widow, yet, as we<br>
say in England, it was of a widow comforted. I took care to let the<br>
ladies see that I knew how to receive them; that I was not at a loss how<br>
to behave to any of them; and, in short, I began to be very popular<br>
there. But I had an occasion afterwards which made me decline that kind<br>
of management, as you shall hear presently.<br>
<br>
About four days after I had received the compliments of condolence from<br>
the Prince ----, the same gentleman he had sent before came to tell me<br>
that his Highness was coming to give me a visit. I was indeed surprised<br>
at that, and perfectly at a loss how to behave. However, as there was<br>
no remedy, I prepared to receive him as well as I could. It was not many<br>
minutes after but he was at the door, and came in, introduced by his own<br>
gentleman, as above, and after by my woman Amy.<br>
<br>
He treated me with abundance of civility, and condoled handsomely on the<br>
loss of my husband, and likewise the manner of it. He told me he<br>
understood he was coming to Versailles to himself, to show him some<br>
jewels; that it was true that he had discoursed with him about jewels,<br>
but could not imagine how any villains should hear of his coming at that<br>
time with them; that he had not ordered him to attend with them at<br>
Versailles, but told him that he would come to Paris by such a day, so<br>
that he was no way accessory to the disaster. I told him gravely I knew<br>
very well that all his Highness had said of that part was true; that<br>
these villains knew his profession, and knew, no doubt, that he always<br>
carried a casket of jewels about him, and that he always wore a diamond<br>
ring on his finger worth a hundred pistoles, which report had magnified<br>
to five hundred; and that, if he had been going to any other place, it<br>
would have been the same thing. After this his Highness rose up to go,<br>
and told me he had resolved, however, to make me some reparation; and<br>
with these words put a silk purse into my hand with a hundred pistoles,<br>
and told me he would make me a farther compliment of a small pension,<br>
which his gentleman would inform me of.<br>
<br>
You may be sure I behaved with a due sense of so much goodness, and<br>
offered to kneel to kiss his hand; but he took me up and saluted me, and<br>
sat down again (though before he made as if he was going away), making<br>
me sit down by him.<br>
<br>
He then began to talk with me more familiarly; told me he hoped I was<br>
not left in bad circumstances; that Mr. ---- was reputed to be very rich,<br>
and that he had gained lately great sums by some jewels, and he hoped,<br>
he said, that I had still a fortune agreeable to the condition I had<br>
lived in before.<br>
<br>
I replied, with some tears, which, I confess, were a little forced, that<br>
I believed, if Mr. ---- had lived, we should have been out of danger of<br>
want, but that it was impossible to estimate the loss which I had<br>
sustained, besides that of the life of my husband; that, by the opinion<br>
of those that knew something of his affairs, and of what value the<br>
jewels were which he intended to have shown to his Highness, he could<br>
not have less about him than the value of a hundred thousand livres;<br>
that it was a fatal blow to me, and to his whole family, especially that<br>
they should be lost in such a manner.<br>
<br>
His Highness returned, with an air of concern, that he was very sorry<br>
for it; but he hoped, if I settled in Paris, I might find ways to<br>
restore my fortune; at the same time he complimented me upon my being<br>
very handsome, as he was pleased to call it, and that I could not fail<br>
of admirers. I stood up and humbly thanked his Highness, but told him I<br>
had no expectations of that kind; that I thought I should be obliged to<br>
go over to England, to look after my husband's effects there, which, I<br>
was told, were considerable, but that I did not know what justice a poor<br>
stranger would get among them; and as for Paris, my fortune being so<br>
impaired, I saw nothing before me but to go back to Poictou to my<br>
friends, where some of my relations, I hoped, might do something for me,<br>
and added that one of my brothers was an abbot at ----, near Poictiers.<br>
<br>
He stood up, and taking me by the hand, led me to a large looking-glass,<br>
which made up the pier in the front of the parlour. &quot;Look there, madam,&quot;<br>
said he; &quot;is it fit that that face&quot; (pointing to my figure in the glass)<br>
&quot;should go back to Poictou? No, madam,&quot; says he; &quot;stay and make some<br>
gentleman of quality happy, that may, in return, make you forget all<br>
your sorrows;&quot; and with that he took me in his arms, and kissing me<br>
twice, told me he would see me again, but with less ceremony.<br>
<br>
Some little time after this, but the same day, his gentleman came to me<br>
again, and with great ceremony and respect, delivered me a black box<br>
tied with a scarlet riband and sealed with a noble coat-of-arms, which,<br>
I suppose, was the prince's.<br>
<br>
There was in it a grant from his Highness, or an assignment--I know not<br>
which to call it--with a warrant to his banker to pay me two thousand<br>
livres a year during my stay in Paris, as the widow of Monsieur ----,<br>
the jeweller, mentioning the horrid murder of my late husband as the<br>
occasion of it, as above.<br>
<br>
I received it with great submission, and expressions of being infinitely<br>
obliged to his master, and of my showing myself on all occasions his<br>
Highness's most obedient servant; and after giving my most humble duty<br>
to his Highness, with the utmost acknowledgments of the obligation, &amp;c.,<br>
I went to a little cabinet, and taking out some money, which made a<br>
little sound in taking it out, offered to give him five pistoles.<br>
<br>
He drew back, but with the greatest respect, and told me he humbly<br>
thanked me, but that he durst not take a farthing; that his Highness<br>
would take it so ill of him, he was sure he would never see his face<br>
more; but that he would not fail to acquaint his Highness what respect I<br>
had offered; and added, &quot;I assure you, madam, you are more in the good<br>
graces of my master, the Prince of ----, than you are aware of; and I<br>
believe you will hear more of him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Now I began to understand him, and resolved, if his Highness did come<br>
again, he should see me under no disadvantages, if I could help it. I<br>
told him, if his Highness did me the honour to see me again, I hoped he<br>
would not let me be so surprised as I was before; that I would be glad<br>
to have some little notice of it, and would be obliged to him if he<br>
would procure it me. He told me he was very sure that when his Highness<br>
intended to visit me he should be sent before to give me notice of it,<br>
and that he would give me as much warning of it as possible.<br>
<br>
He came several times after this on the same errand, that is, about the<br>
settlement, the grant requiring several things yet to be done for making<br>
it payable without going every time to the prince again for a fresh<br>
warrant. The particulars of this part I did not understand; but as soon<br>
as it was finished, which was above two months, the gentleman came one<br>
afternoon, and said his Highness designed to visit me in the evening,<br>
but desired to be admitted without ceremony.<br>
<br>
I prepared not my rooms only, but myself; and when he came in there was<br>
nobody appeared in the house but his gentleman and my maid Amy; and of<br>
her I bid the gentleman acquaint his Highness that she was an<br>
Englishwoman, that she did not understand a word of French, and that she<br>
was one also that might be trusted.<br>
<br>
When he came into my room, I fell down at his feet before he could come<br>
to salute me, and with words that I had prepared, full of duty and<br>
respect, thanked him for his bounty and goodness to a poor, desolate<br>
woman, oppressed under the weight of so terrible a disaster; and refused<br>
to rise till he would allow me the honour to kiss his hand.<br>
<br>
&quot;_Levez vous donc_,&quot; says the prince, taking me in his arms; &quot;I design<br>
more favours for you than this trifle;&quot; and going on, he added, &quot;You<br>
shall for the future find a friend where you did not look for it, and I<br>
resolve to let you see how kind I can be to one who is to me the most<br>
agreeable creature on earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was dressed in a kind of half mourning, had turned off my weeds, and<br>
my head, though I had yet no ribands or lace, was so dressed as failed<br>
not to set me out with advantage enough, for I began to understand his<br>
meaning; and the prince professed I was the most beautiful creature on<br>
earth. &quot;And where have I lived,&quot; says he, &quot;and how ill have I been<br>
served, that I should never till now be showed the finest woman in<br>
France!&quot;<br>
<br>
This was the way in all the world the most likely to break in upon my<br>
virtue, if I had been mistress of any; for I was now become the vainest<br>
creature upon earth, and particularly of my beauty, which as other<br>
people admired, so I became every day more foolishly in love with myself<br>
than before.<br>
<br>
He said some very kind things to me after this, and sat down with me for<br>
an hour or more, when, getting up and calling his gentleman by his name,<br>
he threw open the door: &quot;_Au boire_,&quot; says he; upon which his gentleman<br>
immediately brought up a little table covered with a fine damask cloth,<br>
the table no bigger than he could bring in his two hands, but upon it<br>
was set two decanters, one of champagne and the other of water, six<br>
silver plates, and a service of fine sweetmeats in fine china dishes, on<br>
a set of rings standing up about twenty inches high, one above another.<br>
Below was three roasted partridges and a quail. As soon as his gentleman<br>
had set it all down, he ordered him to withdraw. &quot;Now,&quot; says the prince,<br>
&quot;I intend to sup with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
When he sent away his gentleman, I stood up and offered to wait on his<br>
Highness while he ate; but he positively refused, and told me, &quot;No;<br>
to-morrow you shall be the widow of Monsieur ----, the jeweller, but<br>
to-night you shall be my mistress; therefore sit here,&quot; says he, &quot;and<br>
eat with me, or I will get up and serve.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would then have called up my woman Amy, but I thought that would not<br>
be proper neither; so I made my excuse, that since his Highness would<br>
not let his own servant wait, I would not presume to let my woman come<br>
up; but if he would please to let me wait, it would be my honour to fill<br>
his Highness's wine. But, as before, he would by no means allow me;<br>
so we sat and ate together.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: THE VISIT OF THE PRINCE<br>
<br>
_And refused to rise till he would allow me the honour to kiss his<br>
hand_]<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, madam,&quot; says the prince, &quot;give me leave to lay aside my character;<br>
let us talk together with the freedom of equals. My quality sets me at a<br>
distance from you, and makes you ceremonious. Your beauty exalts you to<br>
more than an equality. I must, then, treat you as lovers do their<br>
mistresses, but I cannot speak the language; it is enough to tell you<br>
how agreeable you are to me, how I am surprised at your beauty, and<br>
resolve to make you happy, and to be happy with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I knew not what to say to him a good while, but blushed, and looking up<br>
towards him, said I was already made happy in the favour of a person of<br>
such rank, and had nothing to ask of his Highness but that he would<br>
believe me infinitely obliged.<br>
<br>
After he had eaten, he poured the sweetmeats into my lap; and the wine<br>
being out, he called his gentleman again to take away the table, who, at<br>
first, only took the cloth and the remains of what was to eat away; and,<br>
laying another cloth, set the table on one side of the room with a noble<br>
service of plate upon it, worth at least two hundred pistoles. Then,<br>
having set the two decanters again upon the table, filled as before, he<br>
withdrew; for I found the fellow understood his business very well, and<br>
his lord's business too.<br>
<br>
About half-an-hour after, the prince told me that I offered to wait a<br>
little before, that if I would now take the trouble he would give me<br>
leave to give him some wine; so I went to the table, filled a glass of<br>
wine, and brought it to him on a fine salver, which the glasses stood<br>
on, and brought the bottle or decanter for water in my other hand, to<br>
mix as he thought fit.<br>
<br>
He smiled, and bid me look on that salver, which I did, and admired it<br>
much, for it was a very fine one indeed. &quot;You may see,&quot; says he, &quot;I<br>
resolve to have more of your company, for my servant shall leave you<br>
that plate for my use.&quot; I told him I believed his Highness would not<br>
take it ill that I was not furnished fit to entertain a person of his<br>
rank, and that I would take great care of it, and value myself<br>
infinitely upon the honour of his Highness's visit.<br>
<br>
It now began to grow late, and he began to take notice of it. &quot;But,&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;I cannot leave you; have you not a spare lodging for one<br>
night?&quot; I told him I had but a homely lodging to entertain such a guest.<br>
He said something exceeding kind on that head, but not fit to repeat,<br>
adding that my company would make him amends.<br>
<br>
About midnight he sent his gentleman of an errand, after telling him<br>
aloud that he intended to stay here all night. In a little time his<br>
gentleman brought him a nightgown, slippers, two caps, a neckcloth, and<br>
shirt, which he gave me to carry into his chamber, and sent his man<br>
home; and then, turning to me, said I should do him the honour to be his<br>
chamberlain of the household, and his dresser also. I smiled, and told<br>
him I would do myself the honour to wait on him upon all occasions.<br>
<br>
About one in the morning, while his gentleman was yet with him, I begged<br>
leave to withdraw, supposing he would go to bed; but he took the hint,<br>
and said, &quot;I'm not going to bed yet; pray let me see you again.&quot;<br>
<br>
I took this time to undress me, and to come in a new dress, which was,<br>
in a manner, _une dishabille_, but so fine, and all about me so clean<br>
and so agreeable, that he seemed surprised. &quot;I thought,&quot; says he, &quot;you<br>
could not have dressed to more advantage than you had done before; but<br>
now,&quot; says he, &quot;you charm me a thousand times more, if that be<br>
possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is only a loose habit, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;that I may the better wait<br>
on your Highness.&quot; He pulls me to him. &quot;You are perfectly obliging,&quot;<br>
says he; and, sitting on the bedside, says he, &quot;Now you shall be a<br>
princess, and know what it is to oblige the gratefullest man alive;&quot; and<br>
with that he took me in his arms.... I can go no farther in the<br>
particulars of what passed at that time, but it ended in this, that, in<br>
short, I lay with him all night.<br>
<br>
I have given you the whole detail of this story to lay it down as a<br>
black scheme of the way how unhappy women are ruined by great men; for,<br>
though poverty and want is an irresistible temptation to the poor,<br>
vanity and great things are as irresistible to others. To be courted by<br>
a prince, and by a prince who was first a benefactor, then an admirer;<br>
to be called handsome, the finest woman in France, and to be treated as<br>
a woman fit for the bed of a prince--these are things a woman must have<br>
no vanity in her, nay, no corruption in her, that is not overcome by it;<br>
and my case was such that, as before, I had enough of both.<br>
<br>
I had now no poverty attending me; on the contrary, I was mistress of<br>
ten thousand pounds before the prince did anything for me. Had I been<br>
mistress of my resolution, had I been less obliging, and rejected the<br>
first attack, all had been safe; but my virtue was lost before, and the<br>
devil, who had found the way to break in upon me by one temptation,<br>
easily mastered me now by another; and I gave myself up to a person who,<br>
though a man of high dignity, was yet the most tempting and obliging<br>
that ever I met with in my life.<br>
<br>
I had the same particular to insist upon here with the prince that I had<br>
with my gentleman before. I hesitated much at consenting at first<br>
asking, but the prince told me princes did not court like other men;<br>
that they brought more powerful arguments; and he very prettily added<br>
that they were sooner repulsed than other men, and ought to be sooner<br>
complied with; intimating, though very genteely, that after a woman had<br>
positively refused him once, he could not, like other men, wait with<br>
importunities and stratagems, and laying long sieges; but as such men as<br>
he stormed warmly, so, if repulsed, they made no second attacks; and,<br>
indeed, it was but reasonable; for as it was below their rank to be long<br>
battering a woman's constancy, so they ran greater hazards in being<br>
exposed in their amours than other men did.<br>
<br>
I took this for a satisfactory answer, and told his Highness that I had<br>
the same thoughts in respect to the manner of his attacks; for that his<br>
person and his arguments were irresistible; that a person of his rank<br>
and a munificence so unbounded could not be withstood; that no virtue<br>
was proof against him, except such as was able, too, to suffer<br>
martyrdom; that I thought it impossible I could be overcome, but that<br>
now I found it was impossible I should not be overcome; that so much<br>
goodness, joined with so much greatness, would have conquered a saint;<br>
and that I confessed he had the victory over me, by a merit infinitely<br>
superior to the conquest he had made.<br>
<br>
He made me a most obliging answer; told me abundance of fine things,<br>
which still flattered my vanity, till at last I began to have pride<br>
enough to believe him, and fancied myself a fit mistress for a prince.<br>
<br>
As I had thus given the prince the last favour, and he had all the<br>
freedom with me that it was possible for me to grant, so he gave me<br>
leave to use as much freedom with him another way, and that was to have<br>
everything of him I thought fit to command; and yet I did not ask of him<br>
with an air of avarice, as if I was greedily making a penny of him, but<br>
I managed him with such art that he generally anticipated my demands. He<br>
only requested of me that I would not think of taking another house, as<br>
I had intimated to his Highness that I intended, not thinking it good<br>
enough to receive his visits in; but he said my house was the most<br>
convenient that could possibly be found in all Paris for an amour,<br>
especially for him, having a way out into three streets, and not<br>
overlooked by any neighbours, so that he could pass and repass without<br>
observation; for one of the back-ways opened into a narrow dark alley,<br>
which alley was a thoroughfare or passage out of one street into<br>
another; and any person that went in or out by the door had no more to<br>
do but to see that there was nobody following him in the alley before he<br>
went in at the door. This request, I knew, was reasonable, and therefore<br>
I assured him I would not change my dwelling, seeing his Highness did<br>
not think it too mean for me to receive him in.<br>
<br>
He also desired me that I would not take any more servants or set up any<br>
equipage, at least for the present; for that it would then be<br>
immediately concluded I had been left very rich, and then I should be<br>
thronged with the impertinence of admirers, who would be attracted by<br>
the money, as well as by the beauty of a young widow, and he should be<br>
frequently interrupted in his visits; or that the world would conclude I<br>
was maintained by somebody, and would be indefatigable to find out the<br>
person; so that he should have spies peeping at him every time he went<br>
out or in, which it would be impossible to disappoint; and that he<br>
should presently have it talked over all the toilets in Paris that the<br>
Prince de ---- had got the jeweller's widow for a mistress.<br>
<br>
This was too just to oppose, and I made no scruple to tell his Highness<br>
that, since he had stooped so low as to make me his own, he ought to<br>
have all the satisfaction in the world that I was all his own; that I<br>
would take all the measures he should please to direct me to avoid the<br>
impertinent attacks of others; and that, if he thought fit, I would be<br>
wholly within doors, and have it given out that I was obliged to go to<br>
England to solicit my affairs there, after my husband's misfortune, and<br>
that I was not expected there again for at least a year or two. This he<br>
liked very well; only he said that he would by no means have me<br>
confined; that it would injure my health, and that I should then take a<br>
country-house in some village, a good way off of the city, where it<br>
should not be known who I was, and that he should be there sometimes to<br>
divert me.<br>
<br>
I made no scruple of the confinement, and told his Highness no place<br>
could be a confinement where I had such a visitor, and so I put off the<br>
country-house, which would have been to remove myself farther from him<br>
and have less of his company; so I made the house be, as it were, shut<br>
up. Amy, indeed, appeared, and when any of the neighbours and servants<br>
inquired, she answered, in broken French, that I was gone to England to<br>
look after my affairs, which presently went current through the streets<br>
about us. For you are to note that the people of Paris, especially the<br>
women, are the most busy and impertinent inquirers into the conduct of<br>
their neighbours, especially that of a single woman, that are in the<br>
world, though there are no greater intriguers in the universe than<br>
themselves; and perhaps that may be the reason of it, for it is an old<br>
but a sure rule, that<br>
<br>
 &quot;When deep intrigues are close and shy,<br>
 The guilty are the first that spy.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus his Highness had the most easy, and yet the most undiscoverable,<br>
access to me imaginable, and he seldom failed to come two or three<br>
nights in a week, and sometimes stayed two or three nights together.<br>
Once he told me he was resolved I should be weary of his company, and<br>
that he would learn to know what it was to be a prisoner; so he gave out<br>
among his servants that he was gone to ----, where he often went<br>
a-hunting, and that he should not return under a fortnight; and that<br>
fortnight he stayed wholly with me, and never went out of my doors.<br>
<br>
Never woman in such a station lived a fortnight in so complete a fulness<br>
of human delight; for to have the entire possession of one of the most<br>
accomplished princes in the world, and of the politest, best-bred man;<br>
to converse with him all day, and, as he professed, charm him all night,<br>
what could be more inexpressibly pleasing, and especially to a woman of<br>
a vast deal of pride, as I was?<br>
<br>
To finish the felicity of this part, I must not forget that the devil<br>
had played a new game with me, and prevailed with me to satisfy myself<br>
with this amour, as a lawful thing; that a prince of such grandeur and<br>
majesty, so infinitely superior to me, and one who had made such an<br>
introduction by an unparalleled bounty, I could not resist; and,<br>
therefore, that it was very lawful for me to do it, being at that time<br>
perfectly single, and unengaged to any other man, as I was, most<br>
certainly, by the unaccountable absence of my first husband, and the<br>
murder of my gentleman who went for my second.<br>
<br>
It cannot be doubted but that I was the easier to persuade myself of the<br>
truth of such a doctrine as this when it was so much for my ease and for<br>
the repose of my mind to have it be so:--<br>
<br>
 &quot;In things we wish, 'tis easy to deceive;<br>
 What we would have, we willingly believe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Besides, I had no casuists to resolve this doubt; the same devil that<br>
put this into my head bade me go to any of the Romish clergy, and, under<br>
the pretence of confession, state the case exactly, and I should see<br>
they would either resolve it to be no sin at all or absolve me upon the<br>
easiest penance. This I had a strong inclination to try, but I know not<br>
what scruple put me off of it, for I could never bring myself to like<br>
having to do with those priests. And though it was strange that I, who<br>
had thus prostituted my chastity and given up all sense of virtue in two<br>
such particular cases, living a life of open adultery, should scruple<br>
anything, yet so it was. I argued with myself that I could not be a<br>
cheat in anything that was esteemed sacred; that I could not be of one<br>
opinion, and then pretend myself to be of another; nor could I go to<br>
confession, who knew nothing of the manner of it, and should betray<br>
myself to the priest to be a Huguenot, and then might come into<br>
trouble; but, in short, though I was a whore, yet I was a Protestant<br>
whore, and could not act as if I was popish, upon any account<br>
whatsoever.<br>
<br>
But, I say, I satisfied myself with the surprising occasion, that as it<br>
was all irresistible, so it was all lawful; for that Heaven would not<br>
suffer us to be punished for that which it was not possible for us to<br>
avoid; and with these absurdities I kept conscience from giving me any<br>
considerable disturbance in all this matter; and I was as perfectly easy<br>
as to the lawfulness of it as if I had been married to the prince and<br>
had had no other husband; so possible is it for us to roll ourselves up<br>
in wickedness, till we grow invulnerable by conscience; and that<br>
sentinel, once dozed, sleeps fast, not to be awakened while the tide of<br>
pleasure continues to flow, or till something dark and dreadful brings<br>
us to ourselves again.<br>
<br>
I have, I confess, wondered at the stupidity that my intellectual part<br>
was under all that while; what lethargic fumes dozed the soul; and how<br>
was it possible that I, who in the case before, where the temptation was<br>
many ways more forcible and the arguments stronger and more<br>
irresistible, was yet under a continued inquietude on account of the<br>
wicked life I led, could now live in the most profound tranquillity and<br>
with an uninterrupted peace, nay, even rising up to satisfaction and<br>
joy, and yet in a more palpable state of adultery than before; for<br>
before, my gentleman, who called me wife, had the pretence of his wife<br>
being parted from him, refusing to do the duty of her office as a wife<br>
to him. As for me, my circumstances were the same; but as for the<br>
prince, as he had a fine and extraordinary lady, or princess, of his<br>
own, so he had had two or three mistresses more besides me, and made no<br>
scruple of it at all.<br>
<br>
However, I say, as to my own part, I enjoyed myself in perfect<br>
tranquillity; and as the prince was the only deity I worshipped, so I<br>
was really his idol; and however it was with his princess, I assure you<br>
his other mistresses found a sensible difference, and though they could<br>
never find me out, yet I had good intelligence that they guessed very<br>
well that their lord had got some new favourite that robbed them of his<br>
company, and, perhaps, of some of his usual bounty too. And now I must<br>
mention the sacrifices he made to his idol, and they were not a few, I<br>
assure you.<br>
<br>
As he loved like a prince, so he rewarded like a prince; for though he<br>
declined my making a figure, as above, he let me see that he was above<br>
doing it for the saving the expense of it, and so he told me, and that<br>
he would make it up in other things. First of all, he sent me a toilet,<br>
with all the appurtenances of silver, even so much as the frame of the<br>
table; and then for the house, he gave me the table, or sideboard of<br>
plate, I mentioned above, with all things belonging to it of massy<br>
silver; so that, in short, I could not for my life study to ask him for<br>
anything of plate which I had not.<br>
<br>
He could, then, accommodate me in nothing more but jewels and clothes,<br>
or money for clothes. He sent his gentleman to the mercer's, and bought<br>
me a suit, or whole piece, of the finest brocaded silk, figured with<br>
gold, and another with silver, and another of crimson; so that I had<br>
three suits of clothes, such as the Queen of France would not have<br>
disdained to have worn at that time. Yet I went out nowhere; but as<br>
those were for me to put on when I went out of mourning, I dressed<br>
myself in them, one after another, always when his Highness came to see<br>
me.<br>
<br>
I had no less than five several morning dresses besides these, so that I<br>
need never be seen twice in the same dress; to these he added several<br>
parcels of fine linen and of lace, so much that I had no room to ask for<br>
more, or, indeed, for so much.<br>
<br>
I took the liberty once, in our freedoms, to tell him he was too<br>
bountiful, and that I was too chargeable to him for a mistress, and that<br>
I would be his faithful servant at less expense to him; and that he not<br>
only left me no room to ask him for anything, but that he supplied me<br>
with such a profusion of good things that I could scarce wear them, or<br>
use them, unless I kept a great equipage, which, he knew, was no way<br>
convenient for him or for me. He smiled, and took me in his arms, and<br>
told me he was resolved, while I was his, I should never be able to ask<br>
him for anything, but that he would be daily asking new favours of me.<br>
<br>
After we were up (for this conference was in bed), he desired I would<br>
dress me in the best suit of clothes I had. It was a day or two after<br>
the three suits were made and brought home. I told him, if he pleased, I<br>
would rather dress me in that suit which I knew he liked best. He asked<br>
me how I could know which he would like best before he had seen them. I<br>
told him I would presume for once to guess at his fancy by my own; so I<br>
went away and dressed me in the second suit, brocaded with silver, and<br>
returned in full dress, with a suit of lace upon my head, which would<br>
have been worth in England two hundred pounds sterling; and I was every<br>
way set out as well as Amy could dress me, who was a very genteel<br>
dresser too. In this figure I came to him, out of my dressing-room,<br>
which opened with folding-doors into his bedchamber.<br>
<br>
He sat as one astonished a good while, looking at me, without speaking a<br>
word, till I came quite up to him, kneeled on one knee to him, and<br>
almost, whether he would or no, kissed his hand. He took me up, and<br>
stood up himself, but was surprised when, taking me in his arms, he<br>
perceived tears to run down my cheeks. &quot;My dear,&quot; says he aloud, &quot;what<br>
mean these tears?&quot; &quot;My lord,&quot; said I, after some little check, for I<br>
could not speak presently, &quot;I beseech you to believe me, they are not<br>
tears of sorrow, but tears of joy. It is impossible for me to see myself<br>
snatched from the misery I was fallen into, and at once to be in the<br>
arms of a prince of such goodness, such immense bounty, and be treated<br>
in such a manner; it is not possible, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;to contain the<br>
satisfaction of it; and it will break out in an excess in some measure<br>
proportioned to your immense bounty, and to the affection which your<br>
Highness treats me with, who am so infinitely below you.&quot;<br>
<br>
It would look a little too much like a romance here to repeat all the<br>
kind things he said to me on that occasion, but I can't omit one<br>
passage. As he saw the tears drop down my cheek, he pulls out a fine<br>
cambric handkerchief, and was going to wipe the tears off, but checked<br>
his hand, as if he was afraid to deface something; I say, he checked his<br>
hand, and tossed the handkerchief to me to do it myself. I took the hint<br>
immediately, and with a kind of pleasant disdain, &quot;How, my lord,&quot; said<br>
I, &quot;have you kissed me so often, and don't you know whether I am painted<br>
or not? Pray let your Highness satisfy yourself that you have no cheats<br>
put upon you; for once let me be vain enough to say I have not deceived<br>
you with false colours.&quot; With this I put a handkerchief into his hand,<br>
and taking his hand into mine, I made him wipe my face so hard that he<br>
was unwilling to do it, for fear of hurting me.<br>
<br>
He appeared surprised more than ever, and swore, which was the first<br>
time that I had heard him swear from my first knowing him, that he could<br>
not have believed there was any such skin without paint in the world.<br>
&quot;Well, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;your Highness shall have a further<br>
demonstration than this, as to that which you are pleased to accept for<br>
beauty, that it is the mere work of nature;&quot; and with that I stepped to<br>
the door and rung a little bell for my woman Amy, and bade her bring me<br>
a cup full of hot water, which she did; and when it was come, I desired<br>
his Highness to feel if it was warm, which he did, and I immediately<br>
washed my face all over with it before him. This was, indeed, more than<br>
satisfaction, that is to say, than believing, for it was an undeniable<br>
demonstration, and he kissed my cheeks and breasts a thousand times,<br>
with expressions of the greatest surprise imaginable.<br>
<br>
Nor was I a very indifferent figure as to shape; though I had had two<br>
children by my gentleman, and six by my true husband, I say I was no<br>
despisable shape; and my prince (I must be allowed the vanity to call<br>
him so) was taking his view of me as I walked from one end of the room<br>
to the other. At last he leads me to the darkest part of the room, and<br>
standing behind me, bade me hold up my head, when, putting both his<br>
hands round my neck, as if he was spanning my neck to see how small it<br>
was, for it was long and small, he held my neck so long and so hard in<br>
his hand that I complained he hurt me a little. What he did it for I<br>
knew not, nor had I the least suspicion but that he was spanning my<br>
neck; but when I said he hurt me, he seemed to let go, and in half a<br>
minute more led me to a pier-glass, and behold I saw my neck clasped<br>
with a fine necklace of diamonds; whereas I felt no more what he was<br>
doing than if he had really done nothing at all, nor did I suspect it in<br>
the least. If I had an ounce of blood in me that did not fly up into my<br>
face, neck, and breasts, it must be from some interruption in the<br>
vessels. I was all on fire with the sight, and began to wonder what it<br>
was that was coming to me.<br>
<br>
However, to let him see that I was not unqualified to receive benefits,<br>
I turned about: &quot;My lord,&quot; says I, &quot;your Highness is resolved to<br>
conquer, by your bounty, the very gratitude of your servants; you will<br>
leave no room for anything but thanks, and make those thanks useless<br>
too, by their bearing no proportion to the occasion.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I love, child,&quot; says he, &quot;to see everything suitable. A fine gown and<br>
petticoat, a fine laced head, a fine face and neck, and no necklace,<br>
would not have made the object perfect. But why that blush, my dear?&quot;<br>
says the prince. &quot;My lord,&quot; said I, &quot;all your gifts call for blushes,<br>
but, above all, I blush to receive what I am so ill able to merit, and<br>
may become so ill also.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus far I am a standing mark of the weakness of great men in their<br>
vice, that value not squandering away immense wealth upon the most<br>
worthless creatures; or, to sum it up in a word, they raise the value of<br>
the object which they pretend to pitch upon by their fancy; I say, raise<br>
the value of it at their own expense; give vast presents for a ruinous<br>
favour, which is so far from being equal to the price that nothing will<br>
at last prove more absurd than the cost men are at to purchase their own<br>
destruction.<br>
<br>
I could not, in the height of all this fine doings--I say, I could not<br>
be without some just reflection, though conscience was, as I said, dumb,<br>
as to any disturbance it gave me in my wickedness. My vanity was fed up<br>
to such a height that I had no room to give way to such reflections. But<br>
I could not but sometimes look back with astonishment at the folly of<br>
men of quality, who, immense in their bounty as in their wealth, give to<br>
a profusion and without bounds to the most scandalous of our sex, for<br>
granting them the liberty of abusing themselves and ruining both.<br>
<br>
I, that knew what this carcase of mine had been but a few years before;<br>
how overwhelmed with grief, drowned in tears, frightened with the<br>
prospect of beggary, and surrounded with rags and fatherless children;<br>
that was pawning and selling the rags that covered me for a dinner, and<br>
sat on the ground despairing of help and expecting to be starved, till<br>
my children were snatched from me to be kept by the parish; I, that was<br>
after this a whore for bread, and, abandoning conscience and virtue,<br>
lived with another woman's husband; I, that was despised by all my<br>
relations, and my husband's too; I, that was left so entirely desolate,<br>
friendless, and helpless that I knew not how to get the least help to<br>
keep me from starving,--that I should be caressed by a prince, for the<br>
honour of having the scandalous use of my prostituted body, common<br>
before to his inferiors, and perhaps would not have denied one of his<br>
footmen but a little while before, if I could have got my bread by it.<br>
<br>
I say, I could not but reflect upon the brutality and blindness of<br>
mankind; that because nature had given me a good skin and some agreeable<br>
features, should suffer that beauty to be such a bait to appetite as to<br>
do such sordid, unaccountable things to obtain the possession of it.<br>
<br>
It is for this reason that I have so largely set down the particulars of<br>
the caresses I was treated with by the jeweller, and also by this<br>
prince; not to make the story an incentive to the vice, which I am now<br>
such a sorrowful penitent for being guilty of (God forbid any should<br>
make so vile a use of so good a design), but to draw the just picture of<br>
a man enslaved to the rage of his vicious appetite; how he defaces the<br>
image of God in his soul, dethrones his reason, causes conscience to<br>
abdicate the possession, and exalts sense into the vacant throne; how he<br>
deposes the man and exalts the brute.<br>
<br>
Oh! could we hear the reproaches this great man afterwards loaded<br>
himself with when he grew weary of this admired creature, and became<br>
sick of his vice, how profitable would the report of them be to the<br>
reader of this story! But had he himself also known the dirty history of<br>
my actings upon the stage of life that little time I had been in the<br>
world, how much more severe would those reproaches have been upon<br>
himself! But I shall come to this again.<br>
<br>
I lived in this gay sort of retirement almost three years, in which time<br>
no amour of such a kind, sure, was ever carried up so high. The prince<br>
knew no bounds to his munificence; he could give me nothing, either for<br>
my wearing, or using, or eating, or drinking, more than he had done from<br>
the beginning.<br>
<br>
His presents were after that in gold, and very frequent and large,<br>
often a hundred pistoles, never less than fifty at a time; and I must do<br>
myself the justice that I seemed rather backward to receive than craving<br>
and encroaching. Not that I had not an avaricious temper, nor was it<br>
that I did not foresee that this was my harvest, in which I was to<br>
gather up, and that it would not last long; but it was that really his<br>
bounty always anticipated my expectations, and even my wishes; and he<br>
gave me money so fast that he rather poured it in upon me than left me<br>
room to ask it; so that, before I could spend fifty pistoles, I had<br>
always a hundred to make it up.<br>
<br>
After I had been near a year and a half in his arms as above, or<br>
thereabouts, I proved with child. I did not take any notice of it to him<br>
till I was satisfied that I was not deceived; when one morning early,<br>
when we were in bed together, I said to him, &quot;My lord, I doubt your<br>
Highness never gives yourself leave to think what the case should be if<br>
I should have the honour to be with child by you.&quot; &quot;Why, my dear,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;we are able to keep it if such a thing should happen; I hope you<br>
are not concerned about that.&quot; &quot;No, my lord,&quot; said I; &quot;I should think<br>
myself very happy if I could bring your Highness a son; I should hope to<br>
see him a lieutenant-general of the king's armies by the interest of his<br>
father, and by his own merit.&quot; &quot;Assure yourself, child,&quot; says he, &quot;if<br>
it should be so, I will not refuse owning him for my son, though it be,<br>
as they call it, a natural son; and shall never slight or neglect him,<br>
for the sake of his mother.&quot; Then he began to importune me to know if it<br>
was so, but I positively denied it so long, till at last I was able to<br>
give him the satisfaction of knowing it himself by the motion of the<br>
child within me.<br>
<br>
He professed himself overjoyed at the discovery, but told me that now it<br>
was absolutely necessary for me to quit the confinement which, he said,<br>
I had suffered for his sake, and to take a house somewhere in the<br>
country, in order for health as well as for privacy, against my<br>
lying-in. This was quite out of my way; but the prince, who was a man of<br>
pleasure, had, it seems, several retreats of this kind, which he had<br>
made use of, I suppose, upon like occasions. And so, leaving it, as it<br>
were, to his gentleman, he provided a very convenient house, about four<br>
miles south of Paris, at the village of ----, where I had very agreeable<br>
lodgings, good gardens, and all things very easy to my content. But one<br>
thing did not please me at all, viz., that an old woman was provided,<br>
and put into the house to furnish everything necessary to my lying-in,<br>
and to assist at my travail.<br>
<br>
I did not like this old woman at all; she looked so like a spy upon me,<br>
or (as sometimes I was frighted to imagine) like one set privately to<br>
despatch me out of the world, as might best suit with the circumstance<br>
of my lying-in. And when his Highness came the next time to see me,<br>
which was not many days, I expostulated a little on the subject of the<br>
old woman; and by the management of my tongue, as well as by the<br>
strength of reasoning, I convinced him that it would not be at all<br>
convenient; that it would be the greater risk on his side; and at first<br>
or last it would certainly expose him and me also. I assured him that my<br>
servant, being an Englishwoman, never knew to that hour who his Highness<br>
was; that I always called him the Count de Clerac, and that she knew<br>
nothing else of him, nor ever should; that if he would give me leave to<br>
choose proper persons for my use, it should be so ordered that not one<br>
of them should know who he was, or perhaps ever see his face; and that,<br>
for the reality of the child that should be born, his Highness, who had<br>
alone been at the first of it, should, if he pleased, be present in the<br>
room all the time, so that he would need no witnesses on that account.<br>
<br>
This discourse fully satisfied him, so that he ordered his gentleman to<br>
dismiss the old woman the same day; and without any difficulty I sent my<br>
maid Amy to Calais, and thence to Dover, where she got an English<br>
midwife and an English nurse to come over on purpose to attend an<br>
English lady of quality, as they styled me, for four months certain.<br>
<br>
The midwife, Amy had agreed to pay a hundred guineas to, and bear her<br>
charges to Paris, and back again to Dover. The poor woman that was to be<br>
my nurse had twenty pounds, and the same terms for charges as the other.<br>
<br>
I was very easy when Amy returned, and the more because she brought with<br>
the midwife a good motherly sort of woman, who was to be her assistant,<br>
and would be very helpful on occasion; and bespoke a man midwife at<br>
Paris too, if there should be any necessity for his help. Having thus<br>
made provision for everything, the Count, for so we all called him in<br>
public, came as often to see me as I could expect, and continued<br>
exceeding kind, as he had always been. One day, conversing together upon<br>
the subject of my being with child, I told him how all things were in<br>
order, but that I had a strange apprehension that I should die with that<br>
child. He smiled. &quot;So all the ladies say, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;when they<br>
are with child.&quot; &quot;Well, however, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;it is but just that<br>
care should be taken that what you have bestowed in your excess of<br>
bounty upon me should not be lost;&quot; and upon this I pulled a paper out<br>
of my bosom, folded up, but not sealed, and I read it to him, wherein I<br>
had left order that all the plate and jewels and fine furniture which<br>
his Highness had given me should be restored to him by my women, and the<br>
keys be immediately delivered to his gentleman in case of disaster.<br>
<br>
Then I recommended my woman, Amy, to his favour for a hundred pistoles,<br>
on condition she gave the keys up as above to his gentleman, and his<br>
gentleman's receipt for them. When he saw this, &quot;My dear child,&quot; said<br>
he, and took me in his arms, &quot;what! have you been making your will and<br>
disposing of your effects? Pray, who do you make your universal heir?&quot;<br>
&quot;So far as to do justice to your Highness, in case of mortality, I have,<br>
my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;and who should I dispose the valuable things to,<br>
which I have had from your hand as pledges of your favour and<br>
testimonies of your bounty, but to the giver of them? If the child<br>
should live, your Highness will, I don't question, act like yourself in<br>
that part, and I shall have the utmost satisfaction that it will be well<br>
used by your direction.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could see he took this very well. &quot;I have forsaken all the ladies in<br>
Paris,&quot; says he, &quot;for you, and I have lived every day since I knew you<br>
to see that you know how to merit all that a man of honour can do for<br>
you. Be easy, child; I hope you shall not die, and all you have is your<br>
own, to do what with it you please.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was then within about two months of my time, and that soon wore off.<br>
When I found my time was come, it fell out very happily that he was in<br>
the house, and I entreated he would continue a few hours in the house,<br>
which he agreed to. They called his Highness to come into the room, if<br>
he pleased, as I had offered and as I desired him; and I sent word I<br>
would make as few cries as possible to prevent disturbing him. He came<br>
into the room once, and called to me to be of good courage, it would<br>
soon be over, and then he withdrew again; and in about half-an-hour more<br>
Amy carried him the news that I was delivered, and had brought him a<br>
charming boy. He gave her ten pistoles for her news, stayed till they<br>
had adjusted things about me, and then came into the room again, cheered<br>
me and spoke kindly to me, and looked on the child, then withdrew, and<br>
came again the next day to visit me.<br>
<br>
Since this, and when I have looked back upon these things with eyes<br>
unpossessed with crime, when the wicked part has appeared in its clearer<br>
light and I have seen it in its own natural colours, when no more<br>
blinded with the glittering appearances which at that time deluded me,<br>
and as in like cases, if I may guess at others by myself, too much<br>
possessed the mind; I say, since this I have often wondered with what<br>
pleasure or satisfaction the prince could look upon the poor innocent<br>
infant, which, though his own, and that he might that way have some<br>
attachment in his affections to it, yet must always afterwards be a<br>
remembrancer to him of his most early crime, and, which was worse, must<br>
bear upon itself, unmerited, an eternal mark of infamy, which should be<br>
spoken of, upon all occasions, to its reproach, from the folly of its<br>
father and wickedness of its mother.<br>
<br>
Great men are indeed delivered from the burthen of their natural<br>
children, or bastards, as to their maintenance. This is the main<br>
affliction in other cases, where there is not substance sufficient<br>
without breaking into the fortunes of the family. In those cases either<br>
a man's legitimate children suffer, which is very unnatural, or the<br>
unfortunate mother of that illegitimate birth has a dreadful affliction,<br>
either of being turned off with her child, and be left to starve, &amp;c.,<br>
or of seeing the poor infant packed off with a piece of money to those<br>
she-butchers who take children off their hands, as 'tis called, that is<br>
to say, starve them, and, in a word, murder them.<br>
<br>
Great men, I say, are delivered from this burthen, because they are<br>
always furnished to supply the expense of their out-of-the-way<br>
offspring, by making little assignments upon the Bank of Lyons or the<br>
townhouse of Paris, and settling those sums, to be received for the<br>
maintenance of such expense as they see cause.<br>
<br>
Thus, in the case of this child of mine, while he and I conversed, there<br>
was no need to make any appointment as an appanage or maintenance for<br>
the child or its nurse, for he supplied me more than sufficiently for<br>
all those things; but afterwards, when time, and a particular<br>
circumstance, put an end to our conversing together (as such things<br>
always meet with a period, and generally break off abruptly), I say,<br>
after that, I found he appointed the children a settled allowance, by an<br>
assignment of annual rent upon the Bank of Lyons, which was sufficient<br>
for bringing them handsomely, though privately, up in the world, and<br>
that not in a manner unworthy of their father's blood, though I came to<br>
be sunk and forgotten in the case; nor did the children ever know<br>
anything of their mother to this day, other than as you may have an<br>
account hereafter.<br>
<br>
But to look back to the particular observation I was making, which I<br>
hope may be of use to those who read my story, I say it was something<br>
wonderful to me to see this person so exceedingly delighted at the birth<br>
of this child, and so pleased with it; for he would sit and look at it,<br>
and with an air of seriousness sometimes a great while together, and<br>
particularly, I observed, he loved to look at it when it was asleep.<br>
<br>
It was indeed a lovely, charming child, and had a certain vivacity in<br>
its countenance that is far from being common to all children so young;<br>
and he would often say to me that he believed there was something<br>
extraordinary in the child, and he did not doubt but he would come to be<br>
a great man.<br>
<br>
I could never hear him say so, but though secretly it pleased me, yet it<br>
so closely touched me another way that I could not refrain sighing, and<br>
sometimes tears; and one time in particular it so affected me that I<br>
could not conceal it from him; but when he saw tears run down my face,<br>
there was no concealing the occasion from him; he was too importunate to<br>
be denied in a thing of that moment; so I frankly answered, &quot;It sensibly<br>
affects me, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;that, whatever the merit of this little<br>
creature may be, he must always have a bend on his arms. The disaster of<br>
his birth will be always, not a blot only to his honour, but a bar to<br>
his fortunes in the world. Our affection will be ever his affliction,<br>
and his mother's crime be the son's reproach. The blot can never be<br>
wiped out by the most glorious action; nay, if it lives to raise a<br>
family,&quot; said I, &quot;the infamy must descend even to its innocent<br>
posterity.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took the thought, and sometimes told me afterwards that it made a<br>
deeper impression on him than he discovered to me at that time; but for<br>
the present he put it off with telling me these things could not be<br>
helped; that they served for a spur to the spirits of brave men,<br>
inspired them with the principles of gallantry, and prompted them to<br>
brave actions; that though it might be true that the mention of<br>
illegitimacy might attend the name, yet that personal virtue placed a<br>
man of honour above the reproach of his birth; that, as he had no share<br>
in the offence, he would have no concern at the blot; when, having by<br>
his own merit placed himself out of the reach of scandal, his fame<br>
should drown the memory of his beginning; that as it was usual for men<br>
of quality to make such little escapes, so the number of their natural<br>
children were so great, and they generally took such good care of their<br>
education, that some of the greatest men in the world had a bend in<br>
their coats-of-arms, and that it was of no consequence to them,<br>
especially when their fame began to rise upon the basis of their<br>
acquired merit; and upon this he began to reckon up to me some of the<br>
greatest families in France and in England also.<br>
<br>
This carried off our discourse for a time; but I went farther with him<br>
once, removing the discourse from the part attending our children to the<br>
reproach which those children would be apt to throw upon us, their<br>
originals; and when speaking a little too feelingly on the subject, he<br>
began to receive the impression a little deeper than I wished he had<br>
done. At last he told me I had almost acted the confessor to him; that I<br>
might, perhaps, preach a more dangerous doctrine to him than we should<br>
either of us like, or than I was aware of. &quot;For, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;if<br>
once we come to talk of repentance we must talk of parting.&quot;<br>
<br>
If tears were in my eyes before, they flowed too fast now to be<br>
restrained, and I gave him but too much satisfaction by my looks that I<br>
had yet no reflections upon my mind strong enough to go that length, and<br>
that I could no more think of parting than he could.<br>
<br>
He said a great many kind things, which were great, like himself, and,<br>
extenuating our crime, intimated to me that he could no more part with<br>
me than I could with him; so we both, as I may say, even against our<br>
light and against our conviction, concluded to sin on; indeed, his<br>
affection to the child was one great tie to him, for he was extremely<br>
fond of it.<br>
<br>
The child lived to be a considerable man. He was first an officer of the<br>
_Garde du Corps_ of France, and afterwards colonel of a regiment of<br>
dragoons in Italy, and on many extraordinary occasions showed that he<br>
was not unworthy such a father, but many ways deserving a legitimate<br>
birth and a better mother; of which hereafter.<br>
<br>
I think I may say now that I lived indeed like a queen; or, if you will<br>
have me confess that my condition had still the reproach of a whore, I<br>
may say I was, sure, the queen of whores; for no woman was ever more<br>
valued or more caressed by a person of such quality only in the station<br>
of a mistress. I had, indeed, one deficiency which women in such<br>
circumstances seldom are chargeable with, namely, I craved nothing of<br>
him, I never asked him for anything in my life, nor suffered myself to<br>
be made use of, as is too much the custom of mistresses, to ask favours<br>
for others. His bounty always prevented me in the first, and my strict<br>
concealing myself in the last, which was no less to my convenience than<br>
his.<br>
<br>
The only favour I ever asked of him was for his gentleman, who he had<br>
all along entrusted with the secret of our affair, and who had once so<br>
much offended him by some omissions in his duty that he found it very<br>
hard to make his peace. He came and laid his case before my woman Amy,<br>
and begged her to speak to me to intercede for him, which I did, and on<br>
my account he was received again and pardoned, for which the grateful<br>
dog requited me by getting to bed to his benefactress, Amy, at which I<br>
was very angry. But Amy generously acknowledged that it was her fault as<br>
much as his; that she loved the fellow so much that she believed if he<br>
had not asked her she should have asked him. I say, this pacified me,<br>
and I only obtained of her that she should not let him know that I knew<br>
it.<br>
<br>
I might have interspersed this part of my story with a great many<br>
pleasant parts and discourses which happened between my maid Amy and I,<br>
but I omit them on account of my own story, which has been so<br>
extraordinary. However, I must mention something as to Amy and her<br>
gentleman.<br>
<br>
I inquired of Amy upon what terms they came to be so intimate, but Amy<br>
seemed backward to explain herself. I did not care to press her upon a<br>
question of that nature, knowing that she might have answered my<br>
question with a question, and have said, &quot;Why, how did I and the prince<br>
come to be so intimate?&quot; So I left off farther inquiring into it, till,<br>
after some time, she told it me all freely of her own accord, which, to<br>
cut it short, amounted to no more than this, that, like mistress like<br>
maid, as they had many leisure hours together below, while they waited<br>
respectively when his lord and I were together above; I say, they could<br>
hardly avoid the usual question one to another, namely, why might not<br>
they do the same thing below that we did above?<br>
<br>
On that account, indeed, as I said above, I could not find in my heart<br>
to be angry with Amy. I was, indeed, afraid the girl would have been<br>
with child too, but that did not happen, and so there was no hurt done;<br>
for Amy had been hanselled before, as well as her mistress, and by the<br>
same party too, as you have heard.<br>
<br>
After I was up again, and my child provided with a good nurse, and,<br>
withal, winter coming on, it was proper to think of coming to Paris<br>
again, which I did; but as I had now a coach and horses, and some<br>
servants to attend me, by my lord's allowance, I took the liberty to<br>
have them come to Paris sometimes, and so to take a tour into the garden<br>
of the Tuileries and the other pleasant places of the city. It happened<br>
one day that my prince (if I may call him so) had a mind to give me some<br>
diversion, and to take the air with me; but, that he might do it and not<br>
be publicly known, he comes to me in a coach of the Count de ----, a<br>
great officer of the court, attended by his liveries also; so that, in a<br>
word, it was impossible to guess by the equipage who I was or who I<br>
belonged to; also, that I might be the more effectually concealed, he<br>
ordered me to be taken up at a mantua-maker's house, where he sometimes<br>
came, whether upon other amours or not was no business of mine to<br>
inquire. I knew nothing whither he intended to carry me; but when he was<br>
in the coach with me, he told me he had ordered his servants to go to<br>
court with me, and he would show me some of the _beau monde_. I told him<br>
I cared not where I went while I had the honour to have him with me. So<br>
he carried me to the fine palace of Meudon, where the Dauphin then was,<br>
and where he had some particular intimacy with one of the Dauphin's<br>
domestics, who procured a retreat for me in his lodgings while we<br>
stayed there, which was three or four days.<br>
<br>
While I was there the king happened to come thither from Versailles, and<br>
making but a short stay, visited Madame the Dauphiness, who was then<br>
living. The prince was here incognito, only because of his being with<br>
me, and therefore, when he heard that the king was in the gardens, he<br>
kept close within the lodgings; but the gentleman in whose lodgings we<br>
were, with his lady and several others, went out to see the king, and I<br>
had the honour to be asked to go with them.<br>
<br>
After we had seen the king, who did not stay long in the gardens, we<br>
walked up the broad terrace, and crossing the hall towards the great<br>
staircase, I had a sight which confounded me at once, as I doubt not it<br>
would have done to any woman in the world. The horse guards, or what<br>
they call there the _gens d'armes_, had, upon some occasion, been either<br>
upon duty or been reviewed, or something (I did not understand that<br>
part) was the matter that occasioned their being there, I know not what;<br>
but, walking in the guard-chamber, and with his jack-boots on, and the<br>
whole habit of the troop, as it is worn when our horse guards are upon<br>
duty, as they call it, at St. James's Park; I say, there, to my<br>
inexpressible confusion, I saw Mr. ----, my first husband, the brewer.<br>
<br>
I could not be deceived; I passed so near him that I almost brushed him<br>
with my clothes, and looked him full in the face, but having my fan<br>
before my face, so that he could not know me. However, I knew him<br>
perfectly well, and I heard him speak, which was a second way of knowing<br>
him. Besides being, you may be sure, astonished and surprised at such a<br>
sight, I turned about after I had passed him some steps, and pretending<br>
to ask the lady that was with me some questions, I stood as if I had<br>
viewed the great hall, the outer guard-chamber, and some things; but I<br>
did it to take a full view of his dress, that I might farther inform<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
While I stood thus amusing the lady that was with me with questions, he<br>
walked, talking with another man of the same cloth, back again, just by<br>
me; and to my particular satisfaction, or dissatisfaction--take it which<br>
way you will--I heard him speak English, the other being, it seems, an<br>
Englishman.<br>
<br>
I then asked the lady some other questions. &quot;Pray, madam,&quot; says I, &quot;what<br>
are these troopers here? Are they the king's guards?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says she;<br>
&quot;they are the _gens d'armes_; a small detachment of them, I suppose,<br>
attended the king to-day, but they are not his Majesty's ordinary<br>
guard.&quot; Another lady that was with her said, &quot;No, madam, it seems that<br>
is not the case, for I heard them saying the _gens d'armes_ were here<br>
to-day by special order, some of them being to march towards the Rhine,<br>
and these attend for orders; but they go back to-morrow to Orleans,<br>
where they are expected.&quot;<br>
<br>
This satisfied me in part, but I found means after this to inquire whose<br>
particular troop it was that the gentlemen that were here belonged to;<br>
and with that I heard they would all be at Paris the week after.<br>
<br>
Two days after this we returned for Paris, when I took occasion to speak<br>
to my lord, that I heard the _gens d'armes_ were to be in the city the<br>
next week, and that I should be charmed with seeing them march if they<br>
came in a body. He was so obliging in such things that I need but just<br>
name a thing of that kind and it was done; so he ordered his gentleman<br>
(I should now call him Amy's gentleman) to get me a place in a certain<br>
house, where I might see them march.<br>
<br>
As he did not appear with me on this occasion, so I had the liberty of<br>
taking my woman Amy with me, and stood where we were very well<br>
accommodated for the observation which I was to make. I told Amy what I<br>
had seen, and she was as forward to make the discovery as I was to have<br>
her, and almost as much surprised at the thing itself. In a word, the<br>
_gens d'armes_ entered the city, as was expected, and made a most<br>
glorious show indeed, being new clothed and armed, and being to have<br>
their standards blessed by the Archbishop of Paris. On this occasion<br>
they indeed looked very gay; and as they marched very leisurely, I had<br>
time to take as critical a view and make as nice a search among them as<br>
I pleased. Here, in a particular rank, eminent for one monstrous-sized<br>
man on the right; here, I say, I saw my gentleman again, and a very<br>
handsome, jolly fellow he was, as any in the troop, though not so<br>
monstrous large as that great one I speak of, who, it seems, was,<br>
however, a gentleman of a good family in Gascony, and was called the<br>
giant of Gascony.<br>
<br>
It was a kind of a good fortune to us, among the other circumstances of<br>
it, that something caused the troops to halt in their march a little<br>
before that particular rank came right against that window which I stood<br>
in, so that then we had occasion to take our full view of him at a small<br>
distance, and so as not to doubt of his being the same person.<br>
<br>
Amy, who thought she might, on many accounts, venture with more safety<br>
to be particular than I could, asked her gentleman how a particular man,<br>
who she saw there among the _gens d'armes_, might be inquired after and<br>
found out; she having seen an Englishman riding there which was supposed<br>
to be dead in England for several years before she came out of London<br>
and that his wife had married again. It was a question the gentleman<br>
did not well understand how to answer; but another person that stood by<br>
told her, if she would tell him the gentleman's name, he would endeavour<br>
to find him out for her, and asked jestingly if he was her lover. Amy<br>
put that off with a laugh, but still continued her inquiry, and in such<br>
a manner as the gentleman easily perceived she was in earnest; so he<br>
left bantering, and asked her in what part of the troop he rode. She<br>
foolishly told him his name, which she should not have done; and<br>
pointing to the cornet that troop carried, which was not then quite out<br>
of sight, she let him easily know whereabouts he rode, only she could<br>
not name the captain. However, he gave her such directions afterwards<br>
that, in short, Amy, who was an indefatigable girl, found him out. It<br>
seems he had not changed his name, not supposing any inquiry would be<br>
made after him here; but, I say, Amy found him out, and went boldly to<br>
his quarters, asked for him, and he came out to her immediately.<br>
<br>
I believe I was not more confounded at my first seeing him at Meudon<br>
than he was at seeing Amy. He started and turned pale as death. Amy<br>
believed if he had seen her at first, in any convenient place for so<br>
villainous a purpose, he would have murdered her.<br>
<br>
But he started, as I say above, and asked in English, with an<br>
admiration, &quot;What are you?&quot; &quot;Sir,&quot; says she, &quot;don't you know me?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says he, &quot;I knew you when you were alive; but what are you<br>
now?--whether ghost or substance I know not.&quot; &quot;Be not afraid, sir, of<br>
that,&quot; says Amy; &quot;I am the same Amy that I was in your service, and do<br>
not speak to you now for any hurt, but that I saw you accidentally<br>
yesterday ride among the soldiers; I thought you might be glad to hear<br>
from your friends at London.&quot; &quot;Well, Amy,&quot; says he then (having a little<br>
recovered himself), &quot;how does everybody do? What! is your mistress<br>
here?&quot; Thus they begun:--<br>
<br>
_Amy._ My mistress, sir, alas! not the mistress you mean; poor<br>
gentlewoman, you left her in a sad condition.<br>
<br>
_Gent._ Why, that's true, Amy; but it could not be helped; I was in a<br>
sad condition myself.<br>
<br>
_Amy._ I believe so, indeed, sir, or else you had not gone away as you<br>
did; for it was a very terrible condition you left them all in, that I<br>
must say.<br>
<br>
_Gent._ What did they do after I was gone?<br>
<br>
_Amy._ Do, sir! Very miserably, you may be sure. How could it be<br>
otherwise?<br>
<br>
_Gent._ Well, that's true indeed; but you may tell me, Amy, what became<br>
of them, if you please; for though I went so away, it was not because I<br>
did not love them all very well, but because I could not bear to see the<br>
poverty that was coming upon them, and which it was not in my power to<br>
help. What could I do?<br>
<br>
_Amy._ Nay, I believe so indeed; and I have heard my mistress say many<br>
times she did not doubt but your affliction was as great as hers,<br>
almost, wherever you were.<br>
<br>
_Gent._ Why, did she believe I was alive, then?<br>
<br>
_Amy._ Yes, sir; she always said she believed you were alive, because<br>
she thought she should have heard something of you if you had been dead.<br>
<br>
_Gent._ Ay, ay; my perplexity was very great indeed, or else I had never<br>
gone away.<br>
<br>
_Amy._ It was very cruel, though, to the poor lady, sir, my mistress;<br>
she almost broke her heart for you at first, for fear of what might<br>
befall you, and at last because she could not hear from you.<br>
<br>
_Gent._ Alas, Amy! what could I do? Things were driven to the last<br>
extremity before I went. I could have done nothing but help starve them<br>
all if I had stayed; and, besides, I could not bear to see it.<br>
<br>
_Amy._ You know, sir, I can say little to what passed before, but I am a<br>
melancholy witness to the sad distresses of my poor mistress as long as<br>
I stayed with her, and which would grieve your heart to hear them.<br>
<br>
[Here she tells my whole story to the time that the parish took off one<br>
of my children, and which she perceived very much affected him; and he<br>
shook his head, and said some things very bitter when he heard of the<br>
cruelty of his own relations to me.]<br>
<br>
_Gent._ Well, Amy, I have heard enough so far. What did she do<br>
afterwards?<br>
<br>
_Amy._ I can't give you any farther account, sir; my mistress would not<br>
let me stay with her any longer. She said she could neither pay me or<br>
subsist me. I told her I would serve her without any wages, but I could<br>
not live without victuals, you know; so I was forced to leave her, poor<br>
lady, sore against my will; and I heard afterwards that the landlord<br>
seized her goods, so she was, I suppose, turned out of doors; for as I<br>
went by the door, about a month after, I saw the house shut up; and,<br>
about a fortnight after that, I found there were workmen at work,<br>
fitting it up, as I suppose, for a new tenant. But none of the<br>
neighbours could tell me what was become of my poor mistress, only that<br>
they said she was so poor that it was next to begging; that some of the<br>
neighbouring gentlefolks had relieved her, or that else she must have<br>
starved.<br>
<br>
Then she went on, and told him that after that they never heard any more<br>
of (me) her mistress, but that she had been seen once or twice in the<br>
city very shabby and poor in clothes, and it was thought she worked with<br>
her needle for her bread.<br>
<br>
All this the jade said with so much cunning, and managed and humoured it<br>
so well, and wiped her eyes and cried so artificially, that he took it<br>
all as it was intended he should, and once or twice she saw tears in his<br>
eyes too. He told her it was a moving, melancholy story, and it had<br>
almost broke his heart at first, but that he was driven to the last<br>
extremity, and could do nothing but stay and see them all starve, which<br>
he could not bear the thoughts of, but should have pistolled himself if<br>
any such thing had happened while he was there; that he left (me) his<br>
wife all the money he had in the world but &pound;25, which was as little as<br>
he could take with him to seek his fortune in the world. He could not<br>
doubt but that his relations, seeing they were all rich, would have<br>
taken the poor children off, and not let them come to the parish; and<br>
that his wife was young and handsome, and, he thought, might marry<br>
again, perhaps, to her advantage, and for that very reason he never<br>
wrote to her or let her know he was alive, that she might in a<br>
reasonable term of years marry, and perhaps mend her fortunes; that he<br>
resolved never to claim her, because he should rejoice to hear that she<br>
had settled to her mind; and that he wished there had been a law made to<br>
empower a woman to marry if her husband was not heard of in so long a<br>
time, which time, he thought, should not be above four years, which was<br>
long enough to send word in to a wife or family from any part of the<br>
world.<br>
<br>
Amy said she could say nothing to that but this, that she was satisfied<br>
her mistress would marry nobody unless she had certain intelligence that<br>
he had been dead from somebody that saw him buried. &quot;But, alas!&quot; says<br>
Amy, &quot;my mistress was reduced to such dismal circumstances that nobody<br>
would be so foolish to think of her, unless it had been somebody to go<br>
a-begging with her.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy then, seeing him so perfectly deluded, made a long and lamentable<br>
outcry how she had been deluded away to marry a poor footman. &quot;For he is<br>
no worse or better,&quot; says she, &quot;though he calls himself a lord's<br>
gentleman. And here,&quot; says Amy, &quot;he has dragged me over into a strange<br>
country to make a beggar of me;&quot; and then she falls a-howling again, and<br>
snivelling, which, by the way, was all hypocrisy, but acted so to the<br>
life as perfectly deceived him, and he gave entire credit to every word<br>
of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;you are very well dressed; you don't look as if<br>
you were in danger of being a beggar.&quot; &quot;Ay, hang 'em!&quot; says Amy, &quot;they<br>
love to have fine clothes here, if they have never a smock under them.<br>
But I love to have money in cash, rather than a chestful of fine<br>
clothes. Besides, sir,&quot; says she, &quot;most of the clothes I have were given<br>
me in the last place I had, when I went away from my mistress.&quot;<br>
<br>
Upon the whole of the discourse, Amy got out of him what condition he<br>
was in and how he lived, upon her promise to him that if ever she came<br>
to England, and should see her old mistress, she should not let her know<br>
that he was alive. &quot;Alas, sir!&quot; says Amy, &quot;I may never come to see<br>
England again as long as I live; and if I should, it would be ten<br>
thousand to one whether I shall see my old mistress, for how should I<br>
know which way to look for her, or what part of England she may be<br>
in?--not I,&quot; says she. &quot;I don't so much as know how to inquire for her;<br>
and if I should,&quot; says Amy, &quot;ever be so happy as to see her, I would not<br>
do her so much mischief as to tell her where you were, sir, unless she<br>
was in a condition to help herself and you too.&quot; This farther deluded<br>
him, and made him entirely open in his conversing with her. As to his<br>
own circumstances, he told her she saw him in the highest preferment he<br>
had arrived to, or was ever like to arrive to; for, having no friends or<br>
acquaintance in France, and, which was worse, no money, he never<br>
expected to rise; that he could have been made a lieutenant to a troop<br>
of light horse but the week before, by the favour of an officer in the<br>
_gens d'armes_ who was his friend, but that he must have found eight<br>
thousand livres to have paid for it to the gentleman who possessed it,<br>
and had leave given him to sell. &quot;But where could I get eight thousand<br>
livres,&quot; says he, &quot;that have never been master of five hundred livres<br>
ready money at a time since I came into France?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh dear, sir!&quot; says Amy, &quot;I am very sorry to hear you say so. I fancy<br>
if you once got up to some preferment, you would think of my old<br>
mistress again, and do something for her. Poor lady,&quot; says Amy, &quot;she<br>
wants it, to be sure;&quot; and then she falls a-crying again. &quot;It is a sad<br>
thing indeed,&quot; says she, &quot;that you should be so hard put to it for<br>
money, when you had got a friend to recommend you, and should lose it<br>
for want of money.&quot; &quot;Ay, so it was, Amy, indeed,&quot; says he; &quot;but what can<br>
a stranger do that has neither money or friends?&quot; Here Amy puts in again<br>
on my account. &quot;Well,&quot; says she, &quot;my poor mistress has had the loss,<br>
though she knows nothing of it. Oh dear! how happy it would have been!<br>
To be sure, sir, you would have helped her all you could.&quot; &quot;Ay,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;Amy, so I would with all my heart; and even as I am, I would send<br>
her some relief, if I thought she wanted it, only that then letting her<br>
know I was alive might do her some prejudice, in case of her settling,<br>
or marrying anybody.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alas,&quot; says Amy, &quot;marry! Who will marry her in the poor condition she<br>
is in?&quot; And so their discourse ended for that time.<br>
<br>
All this was mere talk on both sides, and words of course; for on<br>
farther inquiry, Amy found that he had no such offer of a lieutenant's<br>
commission, or anything like it; and that he rambled in his discourse<br>
from one thing to another; but of that in its place.<br>
<br>
You may be sure that this discourse, as Amy at first related it, was<br>
moving to the last degree upon me, and I was once going to have sent him<br>
the eight thousand livres to purchase the commission he had spoken of;<br>
but as I knew his character better than anybody, I was willing to search<br>
a little farther into it, and so I set Amy to inquire of some other of<br>
the troop, to see what character he had, and whether there was anything<br>
in the story of a lieutenant's commission or no.<br>
<br>
But Amy soon came to a better understanding of him, for she presently<br>
learnt that he had a most scoundrel character; that there was nothing of<br>
weight in anything he said; but that he was, in short, a mere sharper,<br>
one that would stick at nothing to get money, and that there was no<br>
depending on anything he said; and that more especially about the<br>
lieutenant's commission, she understood that there was nothing at all in<br>
it, but they told her how he had often made use of that sham to borrow<br>
money, and move gentlemen to pity him and lend him money, in hopes to<br>
get him preferment; that he had reported that he had a wife and five<br>
children in England, who he maintained out of his pay, and by these<br>
shifts had run into debt in several places; and upon several complaints<br>
for such things, he had been threatened to be turned out of the _gens<br>
d'armes_; and that, in short, he was not to be believed in anything he<br>
said, or trusted on any account.<br>
<br>
Upon this information, Amy began to cool in her farther meddling with<br>
him, and told me it was not safe for me to attempt doing him any good,<br>
unless I resolved to put him upon suspicions and inquiries which might<br>
be to my ruin, in the condition I was now in.<br>
<br>
I was soon confirmed in this part of his character, for the next time<br>
that Amy came to talk with him, he discovered himself more effectually;<br>
for, while she had put him in hopes of procuring one to advance the<br>
money for the lieutenant's commission for him upon easy conditions, he<br>
by degrees dropped the discourse, then pretended it was too late, and<br>
that he could not get it, and then descended to ask poor Amy to lend him<br>
five hundred pistoles.<br>
<br>
Amy pretended poverty, that her circumstances were but mean, and that<br>
she could not raise such a sum; and this she did to try him to the<br>
utmost. He descended to three hundred, then to one hundred, then to<br>
fifty, and then to a pistole, which she lent him, and he, never<br>
intending to pay it, played out of her sight as much as he could. And<br>
thus being satisfied that he was the same worthless thing he had ever<br>
been, I threw off all thoughts of him; whereas, had he been a man of any<br>
sense and of any principle of honour, I had it in my thoughts to retire<br>
to England again, send for him over, and have lived honestly with him.<br>
But as a fool is the worst of husbands to do a woman good, so a fool is<br>
the worst husband a woman can do good to. I would willingly have done<br>
him good, but he was not qualified to receive it or make the best use of<br>
it. Had I sent him ten thousand crowns instead of eight thousand livres,<br>
and sent it with express condition that he should immediately have<br>
bought himself the commission he talked of with part of the money, and<br>
have sent some of it to relieve the necessities of his poor miserable<br>
wife at London, and to prevent his children to be kept by the parish, it<br>
was evident he would have been still but a private trooper, and his wife<br>
and children should still have starved at London, or been kept of mere<br>
charity, as, for aught he knew, they then were.<br>
<br>
Seeing, therefore, no remedy, I was obliged to withdraw my hand from<br>
him, that had been my first destroyer, and reserve the assistance that I<br>
intended to have given him for another more desirable opportunity. All<br>
that I had now to do was to keep myself out of his sight, which was not<br>
very difficult for me to do, considering in what station he lived.<br>
<br>
Amy and I had several consultations then upon the main question,<br>
namely, how to be sure never to chop upon him again by chance, and to be<br>
surprised into a discovery, which would have been a fatal discovery<br>
indeed. Amy proposed that we should always take care to know where the<br>
_gens d'armes_ were quartered, and thereby effectually avoid them; and<br>
this was one way.<br>
<br>
But this was not so as to be fully to my satisfaction; no ordinary way<br>
of inquiring where the _gens d'armes_ were quartered was sufficient to<br>
me; but I found out a fellow who was completely qualified for the work<br>
of a spy (for France has plenty of such people). This man I employed to<br>
be a constant and particular attendant upon his person and motions; and<br>
he was especially employed and ordered to haunt him as a ghost, that he<br>
should scarce let him be ever out of his sight. He performed this to a<br>
nicety, and failed not to give me a perfect journal of all his motions<br>
from day to day, and, whether for his pleasure or his business, was<br>
always at his heels.<br>
<br>
This was somewhat expensive, and such a fellow merited to be well paid,<br>
but he did his business so exquisitely punctual that this poor man<br>
scarce went out of the house without my knowing the way he went, the<br>
company he kept, when he went abroad, and when he stayed at home.<br>
<br>
By this extraordinary conduct I made myself safe, and so went out in<br>
public or stayed at home as I found he was or was not in a possibility<br>
of being at Paris, at Versailles, or any place I had occasion to be at.<br>
This, though it was very chargeable, yet as I found it absolutely<br>
necessary, so I took no thought about the expense of it, for I knew I<br>
could not purchase my safety too dear.<br>
<br>
By this management I found an opportunity to see what a most<br>
insignificant, unthinking life the poor, indolent wretch, who, by his<br>
unactive temper, had at first been my ruin, now lived; how he only rose<br>
in the morning to go to bed at night; that, saving the necessary motion<br>
of the troops, which he was obliged to attend, he was a mere motionless<br>
animal, of no consequence in the world; that he seemed to be one who,<br>
though he was indeed alive, had no manner of business in life but to<br>
stay to be called out of it. He neither kept any company, minded any<br>
sport, played at any game, or indeed did anything of moment; but, in<br>
short, sauntered about like one that it was not two livres value whether<br>
he was dead or alive; that when he was gone, would leave no remembrance<br>
behind him that ever he was here; that if ever he did anything in the<br>
world to be talked of, it was only to get five beggars and starve his<br>
wife. The journal of his life, which I had constantly sent me every<br>
week, was the least significant of anything of its kind that was ever<br>
seen, as it had really nothing of earnest in it, so it would make no<br>
jest to relate it. It was not important enough so much as to make the<br>
reader merry withal, and for that reason I omit it.<br>
<br>
Yet this nothing-doing wretch was I obliged to watch and guard against,<br>
as against the only thing that was capable of doing me hurt in the<br>
world. I was to shun him as we would shun a spectre, or even the devil,<br>
if he was actually in our way; and it cost me after the rate of a<br>
hundred and fifty livres a month, and very cheap too, to have this<br>
creature constantly kept in view. That is to say, my spy undertook never<br>
to let him be out of his sight an hour, but so as that he could give an<br>
account of him, which was much the easier for to be done considering his<br>
way of living; for he was sure that, for whole weeks together, he would<br>
be ten hours of the day half asleep on a bench at the tavern-door where<br>
he quartered, or drunk within the house. Though this wicked life he led<br>
sometimes moved me to pity him, and to wonder how so well-bred,<br>
gentlemanly a man as he once was could degenerate into such a useless<br>
thing as he now appeared, yet at the same time it gave me most<br>
contemptible thoughts of him, and made me often say I was a warning for<br>
all the ladies of Europe against marrying of fools. A man of sense falls<br>
in the world and gets up again, and a woman has some chance for herself;<br>
but with a fool, once fall, and ever undone; once in the ditch, and die<br>
in the ditch; once poor, and sure to starve.<br>
<br>
But it is time to have done with him. Once I had nothing to hope for but<br>
to see him again; now my only felicity was, if possible, never to see<br>
him, and, above all, to keep him from seeing me, which, as above, I took<br>
effectual care of.<br>
<br>
I was now returned to Paris. My little son of honour, as I called him,<br>
was left at ----, where my last country-seat then was, and I came to<br>
Paris at the prince's request. Thither he came to me as soon as I<br>
arrived, and told me he came to give me joy of my return, and to make<br>
his acknowledgments for that I had given him a son. I thought, indeed,<br>
he had been going to give me a present, and so he did the next day, but<br>
in what he said then he only jested with me. He gave me his company all<br>
the evening, supped with me about midnight, and did me the honour, as I<br>
then called it, to lodge me in his arms all the night, telling me, in<br>
jest, that the best thanks for a son born was giving the pledge for<br>
another.<br>
<br>
But as I hinted, so it was; the next morning he laid me down on my<br>
toilet a purse with three hundred pistoles. I saw him lay it down, and<br>
understood what he meant, but I took no notice of it till I came to it,<br>
as it were, casually; then I gave a great cry out, and fell a-scolding<br>
in my way, for he gave me all possible freedom of speech on such<br>
occasions. I told him he was unkind, that he would never give me an<br>
opportunity to ask for anything, and that he forced me to blush by being<br>
too much obliged, and the like; all which I knew was very agreeable to<br>
him, for as he was bountiful beyond measure, so he was infinitely<br>
obliged by my being so backward to ask any favours; and I was even with<br>
him, for I never asked him for a farthing in my life.<br>
<br>
Upon this rallying him, he told me I had either perfectly studied the<br>
art of humour, or else what was the greatest difficulty to others was<br>
natural to me, adding that nothing could be more obliging to a man of<br>
honour than not to be soliciting and craving.<br>
<br>
I told him nothing could be craving upon him, that he left no room for<br>
it; that I hoped he did not give merely to avoid the trouble of being<br>
importuned. I told him he might depend upon it that I should be reduced<br>
very low indeed before I offered to disturb him that way.<br>
<br>
He said a man of honour ought always to know what he ought to do; and as<br>
he did nothing but what he knew was reasonable, he gave me leave to be<br>
free with him if I wanted anything; that he had too much value for me to<br>
deny me anything if I asked, but that it was infinitely agreeable to<br>
him to hear me say that what he did was to my satisfaction.<br>
<br>
We strained compliments thus a great while, and as he had me in his arms<br>
most part of the time, so upon all my expressions of his bounty to me he<br>
put a stop to me with his kisses, and would admit me to go on no<br>
farther.<br>
<br>
I should in this place mention that this prince was not a subject of<br>
France, though at that time he resided at Paris and was much at court,<br>
where, I suppose, he had or expected some considerable employment. But I<br>
mention it on this account, that a few days after this he came to me and<br>
told me he was come to bring me not the most welcome news that ever I<br>
heard from him in his life. I looked at him a little surprised; but he<br>
returned, &quot;Do not be uneasy; it is as unpleasant to me as to you, but I<br>
come to consult with you about it and see if it cannot be made a little<br>
easy to us both.&quot;<br>
<br>
I seemed still more concerned and surprised. At last he said it was that<br>
he believed he should be obliged to go into Italy, which, though<br>
otherwise it was very agreeable to him, yet his parting with me made it<br>
a very dull thing but to think of.<br>
<br>
I sat mute, as one thunderstruck, for a good while; and it presently<br>
occurred to me that I was going to lose him, which, indeed, I could but<br>
ill bear the thoughts of; and as he told me I turned pale. &quot;What's the<br>
matter?&quot; said he hastily. &quot;I have surprised you indeed,&quot; and stepping to<br>
the sideboard fills a dram of cordial water, which was of his own<br>
bringing, and comes to me. &quot;Be not surprised,&quot; said he; &quot;I'll go nowhere<br>
without you;&quot; adding several other things so kind as nothing could<br>
exceed it.<br>
<br>
I might indeed turn pale, for I was very much surprised at first,<br>
believing that this was, as it often happens in such cases, only a<br>
project to drop me, and break off an amour which he had now carried on<br>
so long; and a thousand thoughts whirled about my head in the few<br>
moments while I was kept in suspense, for they were but a few. I say, I<br>
was indeed surprised, and might, perhaps, look pale, but I was not in<br>
any danger of fainting that I knew of.<br>
<br>
However, it not a little pleased me to see him so concerned and anxious<br>
about me, but I stopped a little when he put the cordial to my mouth,<br>
and taking the glass in my hand, I said, &quot;My lord, your words are<br>
infinitely more of a cordial to me than this citron; for as nothing can<br>
be a greater affliction than to lose you, so nothing can be a greater<br>
satisfaction than the assurance that I shall not have that misfortune.&quot;<br>
<br>
He made me sit down, and sat down by me, and after saying a thousand<br>
kind things to me, he turns upon me with a smile: &quot;Why, will you<br>
venture yourself to Italy with me?&quot; says he. I stopped a while, and then<br>
answered that I wondered he would ask me that question, for I would go<br>
anywhere in the world, or all over the world, wherever he should desire<br>
me, and give me the felicity of his company.<br>
<br>
Then he entered into a long account of the occasion of his journey, and<br>
how the king had engaged him to go, and some other circumstances which<br>
are not proper to enter into here; it being by no means proper to say<br>
anything that might lead the reader into the least guess at the person.<br>
<br>
But to cut short this part of the story, and the history of our journey<br>
and stay abroad, which would almost fill up a volume of itself, I say we<br>
spent all that evening in cheerful consultations about the manner of our<br>
travelling, the equipage and figure he should go in, and in what manner<br>
I should go. Several ways were proposed, but none seemed feasible, till<br>
at last I told him I thought it would be so troublesome, so expensive,<br>
and so public that it would be many ways inconvenient to him; and though<br>
it was a kind of death to me to lose him, yet that, rather than so very<br>
much perplex his affairs, I would submit to anything.<br>
<br>
At the next visit I filled his head with the same difficulties, and then<br>
at last came over him with a proposal that I would stay in Paris, or<br>
where else he should direct; and when I heard of his safe arrival, would<br>
come away by myself, and place myself as near him as I could.<br>
<br>
This gave him no satisfaction at all, nor would he hear any more of it;<br>
but if I durst venture myself, as he called it, such a journey, he would<br>
not lose the satisfaction of my company; and as for the expense, that<br>
was not to be named; neither, indeed, was there room to name it, for I<br>
found that he travelled at the king's expense, as well for himself as<br>
for all his equipage, being upon a piece of secret service of the last<br>
importance.<br>
<br>
But after several debates between ourselves, he came to this resolution,<br>
viz., that he would travel incognito, and so he should avoid all public<br>
notice either of himself or of who went with him; and that then he<br>
should not only carry me with him, but have a perfect leisure of<br>
enjoying my agreeable company (as he was pleased to call it) all the<br>
way.<br>
<br>
This was so obliging that nothing could be more so. Upon this foot he<br>
immediately set to work to prepare things for his journey, and, by his<br>
directions, so did I too. But now I had a terrible difficulty upon me,<br>
and which way to get over it I knew not; and that was, in what manner to<br>
take care of what I had to leave behind me. I was rich, as I have said,<br>
very rich, and what to do with it I knew not; nor who to leave in trust<br>
I knew not. I had nobody but Amy in the world, and to travel without Amy<br>
was very uncomfortable, or to leave all I had in the world with her,<br>
and, if she miscarried, be ruined at once, was still a frightful<br>
thought; for Amy might die, and whose hands things might fall into I<br>
knew not. This gave me great uneasiness, and I knew not what to do; for<br>
I could not mention it to the prince, lest he should see that I was<br>
richer than he thought I was.<br>
<br>
But the prince made all this easy to me; for in concerting measures for<br>
our journey he started the thing himself, and asked me merrily one<br>
evening who I would trust with all my wealth in my absence.<br>
<br>
&quot;My wealth, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;except what I owe to your goodness is but<br>
small, but yet that little I have, I confess, causes some<br>
thoughtfulness, because I have no acquaintance in Paris that I dare<br>
trust with it, nor anybody but my woman to leave in the house; and how<br>
to do without her upon the road I do not well know.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As to the road, be not concerned,&quot; says the prince; &quot;I'll provide you<br>
servants to your mind; and as for your woman, if you can trust her,<br>
leave her here, and I'll put you in a way how to secure things as well<br>
as if you were at home.&quot; I bowed, and told him I could not be put into<br>
better hands than his own, and that, therefore, I would govern all my<br>
measures by his directions; so we talked no more of it that night.<br>
<br>
The next day he sent me in a great iron chest, so large that it was as<br>
much as six lusty fellows could get up the steps into the house; and in<br>
this I put, indeed, all my wealth; and for my safety he ordered a good,<br>
honest, ancient man and his wife to be in the house with her, to keep<br>
her company, and a maid-servant and boy; so that there was a good<br>
family, and Amy was madam, the mistress of the house.<br>
<br>
Things being thus secured, we set out incog., as he called it; but we<br>
had two coaches and six horses, two chaises, and about eight<br>
men-servants on horseback, all very well armed.<br>
<br>
Never was woman better used in this world that went upon no other<br>
account than I did. I had three women-servants to wait on me, one<br>
whereof was an old Madame ----, who thoroughly understood her business,<br>
and managed everything as if she had been major-domo; so I had no<br>
trouble. They had one coach to themselves, and the prince and I in the<br>
other; only that sometimes, where he knew it necessary, I went into<br>
their coach, and one particular gentleman of the retinue rode with him.<br>
<br>
I shall say no more of the journey than that when we came to those<br>
frightful mountains, the Alps, there was no travelling in our coaches,<br>
so he ordered a horse-litter, but carried by mules, to be provided for<br>
me, and himself went on horseback. The coaches went some other way back<br>
to Lyons. Then we had coaches hired at Turin, which met us at Suza; so<br>
that we were accommodated again, and went by easy journeys afterwards to<br>
Rome, where his business, whatever it was, called him to stay some time,<br>
and from thence to Venice.<br>
<br>
He was as good as his word, indeed; for I had the pleasure of his<br>
company, and, in a word, engrossed his conversation almost all the way.<br>
He took delight in showing me everything that was to be seen, and<br>
particularly in telling me something of the history of everything he<br>
showed me.<br>
<br>
What valuable pains were here thrown away upon one who he was sure, at<br>
last, to abandon with regret! How below himself did a man of quality and<br>
of a thousand accomplishments behave in all this! It is one of my<br>
reasons for entering into this part, which otherwise would not be worth<br>
relating. Had I been a daughter or a wife, of whom it might be said that<br>
he had a just concern in their instruction or improvement, it had been<br>
an admirable step; but all this to a whore; to one who he carried with<br>
him upon no account that could be rationally agreeable, and none but to<br>
gratify the meanest of human frailties--this was the wonder of it. But<br>
such is the power of a vicious inclination. Whoring was, in a word, his<br>
darling crime, the worst excursion he made, for he was otherwise one of<br>
the most excellent persons in the world. No passions, no furious<br>
excursions, no ostentatious pride; the most humble, courteous, affable<br>
person in the world. Not an oath, not an indecent word, or the least<br>
blemish in behaviour was to be seen in all his conversation, except as<br>
before excepted; and it has given me occasion for many dark reflections<br>
since, to look back and think that I should be the snare of such a<br>
person's life; that I should influence him to so much wickedness, and<br>
that I should be the instrument in the hand of the devil to do him so<br>
much prejudice.<br>
<br>
We were near two years upon this grand tour, as it may be called, during<br>
most of which I resided at Rome or at Venice, having only been twice at<br>
Florence and once at Naples. I made some very diverting and useful<br>
observations in all these places, and particularly of the conduct of the<br>
ladies; for I had opportunity to converse very much among them, by the<br>
help of the old witch that travelled with us. She had been at Naples and<br>
at Venice, and had lived in the former several years, where, as I found,<br>
she had lived but a loose life, as indeed the women of Naples generally<br>
do; and, in short, I found she was fully acquainted with all the<br>
intriguing arts of that part of the world.<br>
<br>
Here my lord bought me a little female Turkish slave, who, being taken<br>
at sea by a Maltese man-of-war, was brought in there, and of her I<br>
learnt the Turkish language, their way of dressing and dancing, and some<br>
Turkish, or rather Moorish, songs, of which I made use to my advantage<br>
on an extraordinary occasion some years after, as you shall hear in its<br>
place. I need not say I learnt Italian too, for I got pretty well<br>
mistress of that before I had been there a year; and as I had leisure<br>
enough and loved the language, I read all the Italian books I could come<br>
at.<br>
<br>
I began to be so in love with Italy, especially with Naples and Venice,<br>
that I could have been very well satisfied to have sent for Amy and have<br>
taken up my residence there for life.<br>
<br>
As to Rome, I did not like it at all. The swarms of ecclesiastics of all<br>
kinds on one side, and the scoundrel rabbles of the common people on the<br>
other, make Rome the unpleasantest place in the world to live in. The<br>
innumerable number of valets, lackeys, and other servants is such that<br>
they used to say that there are very few of the common people in Rome<br>
but what have been footmen, or porters, or grooms to cardinals or<br>
foreign ambassadors. In a word, they have an air of sharping and<br>
cozening, quarrelling and scolding, upon their general behaviour; and<br>
when I was there the footmen made such a broil between two great<br>
families in Rome, about which of their coaches (the ladies being in the<br>
coaches on either side) should give way to the other, that there was<br>
about thirty people wounded on both sides, five or six killed outside,<br>
and both the ladies frighted almost to death.<br>
<br>
But I have no mind to write the history of my travels on this side of<br>
the world, at least not now; it would be too full of variety.<br>
<br>
I must not, however, omit that the prince continued in all this journey<br>
the most kind, obliging person to me in the world, and so constant that,<br>
though we were in a country where it is well known all manner of<br>
liberties are taken, I am yet well assured he neither took the liberty<br>
he knew he might have, or so much as desired it.<br>
<br>
I have often thought of this noble person on that account. Had he been<br>
but half so true, so faithful and constant, to the best lady in the<br>
world--I mean his princess--how glorious a virtue had it been in him!<br>
And how free had he been from those just reflections which touched him<br>
in her behalf when it was too late!<br>
<br>
We had some very agreeable conversations upon this subject, and once he<br>
told me, with a kind of more than ordinary concern upon his thoughts,<br>
that he was greatly beholden to me for taking this hazardous and<br>
difficult journey, for that I had kept him honest. I looked up in his<br>
face, and coloured as red as fire. &quot;Well, well,&quot; says he, &quot;do not let<br>
that surprise you, I do say you have kept me honest.&quot; &quot;My lord,&quot; said I,<br>
&quot;'tis not for me to explain your words, but I wish I could turn them my<br>
own way. I hope,&quot; says I, &quot;and believe we are both as honest as we can<br>
be in our circumstances.&quot; &quot;Ay, ay,&quot; says he; &quot;and honester than I doubt<br>
I should have been if you had not been with me. I cannot say but if you<br>
had not been here I should have wandered among the gay world here, in<br>
Naples, and in Venice too, for 'tis not such a crime here as 'tis in<br>
other places. But I protest,&quot; says he, &quot;I have not touched a woman in<br>
Italy but yourself; and more than that, I have not so much as had any<br>
desire to it. So that, I say, you have kept me honest.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was silent, and was glad that he interrupted me, or kept me from<br>
speaking, with kissing me, for really I knew not what to say. I was once<br>
going to say that if his lady, the princess, had been with him, she<br>
would doubtless have had the same influence upon his virtue, with<br>
infinitely more advantage to him; but I considered this might give him<br>
offence; and, besides, such things might have been dangerous to the<br>
circumstance I stood in, so it passed off. But I must confess I saw that<br>
he was quite another man as to women than I understood he had always<br>
been before, and it was a particular satisfaction to me that I was<br>
thereby convinced that what he said was true, and that he was, as I may<br>
say, all my own.<br>
<br>
I was with child again in this journey, and lay in at Venice, but was<br>
not so happy as before. I brought him another son, and a very fine boy<br>
it was, but it lived not above two months; nor, after the first touches<br>
of affection (which are usual, I believe, to all mothers) were over, was<br>
I sorry the child did not live, the necessary difficulties attending it<br>
in our travelling being considered.<br>
<br>
After these several perambulations, my lord told me his business began<br>
to close, and we would think of returning to France, which I was very<br>
glad of, but principally on account of my treasure I had there, which,<br>
as you have heard, was very considerable. It is true I had letters very<br>
frequently from my maid Amy, with accounts that everything was very<br>
safe, and that was very much to my satisfaction. However, as the<br>
prince's negotiations were at an end, and he was obliged to return, I<br>
was very glad to go; so we returned from Venice to Turin, and in the way<br>
I saw the famous city of Milan. From Turin we went over the mountains<br>
again, as before, and our coaches met us at Pont &agrave; Voisin, between<br>
Chambery and Lyons; and so, by easy journeys, we arrived safely at<br>
Paris, having been absent two years, wanting about eleven days, as<br>
above.<br>
<br>
I found the little family we left just as we left them, and Amy cried<br>
for joy when she saw me, and I almost did the same.<br>
<br>
The prince took his leave of me the night before, for, as he told me, he<br>
knew he should be met upon the road by several persons of quality, and<br>
perhaps by the princess herself; so we lay at two different inns that<br>
night, lest some should come quite to the place, as indeed it happened.<br>
<br>
After this I saw him not for above twenty days, being taken up in his<br>
family, and also with business; but he sent me his gentleman to tell me<br>
the reason of it, and bid me not be uneasy, and that satisfied me<br>
effectually.<br>
<br>
In all this affluence of my good fortune I did not forget that I had<br>
been rich and poor once already alternately, and that I ought to know<br>
that the circumstances I was now in were not to be expected to last<br>
always; that I had one child, and expected another; and if I had bred<br>
often, it would something impair me in the great article that supported<br>
my interest--I mean, what he called beauty; that as that declined, I<br>
might expect the fire would abate, and the warmth with which I was now<br>
so caressed would cool, and in time, like the other mistresses of great<br>
men, I might be dropped again; and that therefore it was my business to<br>
take care that I should fall as softly as I could.<br>
<br>
I say, I did not forget, therefore, to make as good provision for<br>
myself as if I had had nothing to have subsisted on but what I now<br>
gained; whereas I had not less than ten thousand pounds, as I said<br>
above, which I had amassed, or secured rather, out of the ruins of my<br>
faithful friend the jeweller, and which he, little thinking of what was<br>
so near him when he went out, told me, though in a kind of a jest, was<br>
all my own, if he was knocked on the head, and which, upon that title, I<br>
took care to preserve.<br>
<br>
My greatest difficulty now was how to secure my wealth and to keep what<br>
I had got; for I had greatly added to this wealth by the generous bounty<br>
of the Prince ----, and the more by the private, retired mode of living,<br>
which he rather desired for privacy than parsimony; for he supplied me<br>
for a more magnificent way of life than I desired, if it had been<br>
proper.<br>
<br>
I shall cut short the history of this prosperous wickedness with telling<br>
you I brought him a third son, within little more than eleven months<br>
after our return from Italy; that now I lived a little more openly, and<br>
went by a particular name which he gave me abroad, but which I must<br>
omit, viz., the Countess de ----; and had coaches and servants, suitable<br>
to the quality he had given me the appearance of; and, which is more<br>
than usually happens in such cases, this held eight years from the<br>
beginning, during which time, as I had been very faithful to him, so I<br>
must say, as above, that I believe he was so separated to me, that<br>
whereas he usually had two or three women, which he kept privately, he<br>
had not in all that time meddled with any of them, but that I had so<br>
perfectly engrossed him that he dropped them all. Not, perhaps, that he<br>
saved much by it, for I was a very chargeable mistress to him, that I<br>
must acknowledge, but it was all owing to his particular affection to<br>
me, not to my extravagance, for, as I said, he never gave me leave to<br>
ask him for anything, but poured in his favours and presents faster than<br>
I expected, and so fast as I could not have the assurance to make the<br>
least mention of desiring more. Nor do I speak this of my own guess, I<br>
mean about his constancy to me and his quitting all other women; but the<br>
old harridan, as I may call her, whom he made the guide of our<br>
travelling, and who was a strange old creature, told me a thousand<br>
stories of his gallantry, as she called it, and how, as he had no less<br>
than three mistresses at one time, and, as I found, all of her<br>
procuring, he had of a sudden dropped them all, and that he was entirely<br>
lost to both her and them; that they did believe he had fallen into some<br>
new hands, but she could never hear who, or where, till he sent for her<br>
to go this journey; and then the old hag complimented me upon his<br>
choice; that she did not wonder I had so engrossed him; so much beauty,<br>
&amp;c.; and there she stopped.<br>
<br>
Upon the whole, I found by her what was, you may be sure, to my<br>
particular satisfaction, viz., that, as above, I had him all my own. But<br>
the highest tide has its ebb; and in all things of this kind there is a<br>
reflux which sometimes, also, is more impetuously violent than the first<br>
aggression. My prince was a man of a vast fortune, though no sovereign,<br>
and therefore there was no probability that the expense of keeping a<br>
mistress could be injurious to him, as to his estate. He had also<br>
several employments, both out of France as well as in it; for, as above,<br>
I say he was not a subject of France, though he lived in that court. He<br>
had a princess, a wife with whom he had lived several years, and a woman<br>
(so the voice of fame reported) the most valuable of her sex, of birth<br>
equal to him, if not superior, and of fortune proportionable; but in<br>
beauty, wit, and a thousand good qualities superior, not to most women,<br>
but even to all her sex; and as to her virtue, the character which was<br>
justly her due was that of, not only the best of princesses, but even<br>
the best of women.<br>
<br>
They lived in the utmost harmony, as with such a princess it was<br>
impossible to be otherwise. But yet the princess was not insensible that<br>
her lord had his foibles, that he did make some excursions, and<br>
particularly that he had one favourite mistress, which sometimes<br>
engrossed him more than she (the princess) could wish, or be easily<br>
satisfied with. However, she was so good, so generous, so truly kind a<br>
wife, that she never gave him any uneasiness on this account; except so<br>
much as must arise from his sense of her bearing the affront of it with<br>
such patience, and such a profound respect for him as was in itself<br>
enough to have reformed him, and did sometimes shock his generous mind,<br>
so as to keep him at home, as I may call it, a great while together. And<br>
it was not long before I not only perceived it by his absence, but<br>
really got a knowledge of the reason of it, and once or twice he even<br>
acknowledged it to me.<br>
<br>
It was a point that lay not in me to manage. I made a kind of motion<br>
once or twice to him to leave me, and keep himself to her, as he ought<br>
by the laws and rites of matrimony to do, and argued the generosity of<br>
the princess to him, to persuade him; but I was a hypocrite, for had I<br>
prevailed with him really to be honest, I had lost him, which I could<br>
not bear the thoughts of; and he might easily see I was not in earnest.<br>
One time in particular, when I took upon me to talk at this rate, I<br>
found, when I argued so much for the virtue and honour, the birth, and,<br>
above all, the generous usage he found in the person of the princess<br>
with respect to his private amours, and how it should prevail upon him,<br>
&amp;c., I found it began to affect him, and he returned, &quot;And do you<br>
indeed,&quot; says he, &quot;persuade me to leave you? Would you have me think<br>
you sincere?&quot; I looked up in his face, smiling. &quot;Not for any other<br>
favourite, my lord,&quot; says I; &quot;that would break my heart; but for madam<br>
the princess!&quot; said I; and then I could say no more. Tears followed, and<br>
I sat silent a while. &quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;if ever I do leave you, it shall<br>
be on the virtuous account; it shall be for the princess; I assure you<br>
it shall be for no other woman.&quot; &quot;That's enough, my lord,&quot; said I;<br>
&quot;there I ought to submit; and while I am assured it shall be for no<br>
other mistress, I promise your Highness I will not repine; or that, if I<br>
do, it shall be a silent grief; it shall not interrupt your felicity.&quot;<br>
<br>
All this while I said I knew not what, and said what I was no more able<br>
to do than he was able to leave me; which, at that time, he owned he<br>
could not do--no, not for the princess herself.<br>
<br>
But another turn of affairs determined this matter, for the princess was<br>
taken very ill, and, in the opinion of all her physicians, very<br>
dangerously so. In her sickness she desired to speak with her lord, and<br>
to take her leave of him. At this grievous parting she said so many<br>
passionate, kind things to him, lamented that she had left him no<br>
children (she had had three, but they were dead); hinted to him that it<br>
was one of the chief things which gave her satisfaction in death, as to<br>
this world, that she should leave him room to have heirs to his family,<br>
by some princess that should supply her place; with all humility, but<br>
with a Christian earnestness, recommended to him to do justice to such<br>
princess, whoever it should be, from whom, to be sure, he would expect<br>
justice; that is to say, to keep to her singly, according to the<br>
solemnest part of the marriage covenant; humbly asked his Highness's<br>
pardon if she had any way offended him; and appealing to Heaven, before<br>
whose tribunal she was to appear, that she had never violated her honour<br>
or her duty to him, and praying to Jesus and the blessed Virgin for his<br>
Highness; and thus, with the most moving and most passionate expressions<br>
of her affection to him, took her last leave of him, and died the next<br>
day.<br>
<br>
This discourse, from a princess so valuable in herself and so dear to<br>
him, and the loss of her following so immediately after, made such deep<br>
impressions on him that he looked back with detestation upon the former<br>
part of his life, grew melancholy and reserved, changed his society and<br>
much of the general conduct of his life, resolved on a life regulated<br>
most strictly by the rules of virtue and piety, and, in a word, was<br>
quite another man.<br>
<br>
The first part of his reformation was a storm upon me; for, about ten<br>
days after the princess's funeral, he sent a message to me by his<br>
gentleman, intimating, though in very civil terms, and with a short<br>
preamble or introduction, that he desired I would not take it ill that<br>
he was obliged to let me know that he could see me no more. His<br>
gentleman told me a long story of the new regulation of life his lord<br>
had taken up; and that he had been so afflicted for the loss of his<br>
princess that he thought it would either shorten his life or he would<br>
retire into some religious house, to end his days in solitude.<br>
<br>
I need not direct anybody to suppose how I received this news. I was<br>
indeed exceedingly surprised at it, and had much ado to support myself<br>
when the first part of it was delivered, though the gentleman delivered<br>
his errand with great respect, and with all the regard to me that he was<br>
able, and with a great deal of ceremony, also telling me how much he was<br>
concerned to bring me such a message.<br>
<br>
But when I heard the particulars of the story at large, and especially<br>
that of the lady's discourse to the prince a little before her death, I<br>
was fully satisfied. I knew very well he had done nothing but what any<br>
man must do that had a true sense upon him of the justice of the<br>
princess's discourse to him, and of the necessity there was of his<br>
altering his course of life, if he intended to be either a Christian or<br>
an honest man. I say, when I heard this I was perfectly easy. I confess<br>
it was a circumstance that it might be reasonably expected should have<br>
wrought something also upon me; I that had so much to reflect upon more<br>
than the prince; that had now no more temptation of poverty, or of the<br>
powerful motive which Amy used with me--namely, comply and live, deny<br>
and starve; I say, I that had no poverty to introduce vice, but was<br>
grown not only well supplied, but rich; and not only rich, but was very<br>
rich; in a word, richer than I knew how to think of, for the truth of it<br>
was, that thinking of it sometimes almost distracted me, for want of<br>
knowing how to dispose of it, and for fear of losing it all again by<br>
some cheat or trick, not knowing anybody that I could commit the trust<br>
of it to.<br>
<br>
Besides, I should add, at the close of this affair, that the prince did<br>
not, as I may say, turn me off rudely and with disgust, but with all the<br>
decency and goodness peculiar to himself, and that could consist with a<br>
man reformed and struck with the sense of his having abused so good a<br>
lady as his late princess had been. Nor did he send me away empty, but<br>
did everything like himself; and, in particular, ordered his gentleman<br>
to pay the rent of the house and all the expense of his two sons, and to<br>
tell me how they were taken care of, and where, and also that I might at<br>
all times inspect the usage they had, and if I disliked anything it<br>
should be rectified; and having thus finished everything, he retired<br>
into Lorraine, or somewhere that way, where he had an estate, and I<br>
never heard of him more--I mean, not as a mistress.<br>
<br>
Now I was at liberty to go to any part of the world, and take care of my<br>
money myself. The first thing that I resolved to do was to go directly<br>
to England, for there, I thought, being among my country-folks--for I<br>
esteemed myself an Englishwoman, though I was born in France--there, I<br>
say, I thought I could better manage things than in France; at least,<br>
that I would be in less danger of being circumvented and deceived; but<br>
how to get away with such a treasure as I had with me was a difficult<br>
point, and what I was greatly at a loss about.<br>
<br>
There was a Dutch merchant in Paris, that was a person of great<br>
reputation for a man of substance and of honesty, but I had no manner of<br>
acquaintance with him, nor did I know how to get acquainted with him, so<br>
as to discover my circumstances to him; but at last I employed my maid<br>
Amy (such I must be allowed to call her, notwithstanding what has been<br>
said of her, because she was in the place of a maid-servant); I say, I<br>
employed my maid Amy to go to him, and she got a recommendation to him<br>
from somebody else, I knew not who, so that she got access to him well<br>
enough.<br>
<br>
But now was my case as bad as before, for when I came to him what could<br>
I do? I had money and jewels to a vast value, and I might leave all<br>
those with him; that I might indeed do; and so I might with several<br>
other merchants in Paris, who would give me bills for it, payable at<br>
London; but then I ran a hazard of my money, and I had nobody at London<br>
to send the bills to, and so to stay till I had an account that they<br>
were accepted; for I had not one friend in London that I could have<br>
recourse to, so that indeed I knew not what to do.<br>
<br>
In this case I had no remedy but that I must trust somebody, so I sent<br>
Amy to this Dutch merchant, as I said above. He was a little surprised<br>
when Amy came to him and talked to him of remitting a sum of about<br>
twelve thousand pistoles to England, and began to think she came to put<br>
some cheat upon him; but when he found that Amy was but a servant, and<br>
that I came to him myself, the case was altered presently.<br>
<br>
When I came to him myself, I presently saw such a plainness in his<br>
dealing and such honesty in his countenance that I made no scruple to<br>
tell him my whole story, viz., that I was a widow, that I had some<br>
jewels to dispose of, and also some money which I had a mind to send to<br>
England, and to follow there myself; but being but a woman, and having<br>
no correspondence in London, or anywhere else, I knew not what to do,<br>
or how to secure my effects.<br>
<br>
He dealt very candidly with me, but advised me, when he knew my case so<br>
particularly, to take bills upon Amsterdam, and to go that way to<br>
England; for that I might lodge my treasure in the bank there, in the<br>
most secure manner in the world, and that there he could recommend me to<br>
a man who perfectly understood jewels, and would deal faithfully with me<br>
in the disposing them.<br>
<br>
I thanked him, but scrupled very much the travelling so far in a strange<br>
country, and especially with such a treasure about me; that, whether<br>
known or concealed, I did not know how to venture with it. Then he told<br>
me he would try to dispose of them there, that is, at Paris, and convert<br>
them into money, and so get me bills for the whole; and in a few days he<br>
brought a Jew to me, who pretended to buy the jewels. As soon as the Jew<br>
saw the jewels I saw my folly, and it was ten thousand to one but I had<br>
been ruined, and perhaps put to death in as cruel a manner as possible;<br>
and I was put in such a fright by it that I was once upon the point of<br>
flying for my life, and leaving the jewels and money too in the hands of<br>
the Dutchman, without any bills or anything else. The case was thus:--<br>
<br>
As soon as the Jew saw the jewels he falls a-jabbering, in Dutch or<br>
Portuguese, to the merchant; and I could presently perceive that they<br>
were in some great surprise, both of them. The Jew held up his hands,<br>
looked at me with some horror, then talked Dutch again, and put himself<br>
into a thousand shapes, twisting his body and wringing up his face this<br>
way and that way in his discourse, stamping with his feet, and throwing<br>
abroad his hands, as if he was not in a rage only, but in a mere fury.<br>
Then he would turn and give a look at me like the devil. I thought I<br>
never saw anything so frightful in my life.<br>
<br>
At length I put in a word. &quot;Sir,&quot; says I to the Dutch merchant, &quot;what is<br>
all this discourse to my business? What is this gentleman in all these<br>
passions about? I wish, if he is to treat with me, he would speak that I<br>
may understand him; or if you have business of your own between you that<br>
is to be done first, let me withdraw, and I'll come again when you are<br>
at leisure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, madam,&quot; says the Dutchman very kindly, &quot;you must not go; all<br>
our discourse is about you and your jewels, and you shall hear it<br>
presently; it concerns you very much, I assure you.&quot; &quot;Concern me!&quot; says<br>
I. &quot;What can it concern me so much as to put this gentleman into such<br>
agonies, and what makes him give me such devil's looks as he does? Why,<br>
he looks as if he would devour me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Jew understood me presently, continuing in a kind of rage, and spoke<br>
in French: &quot;Yes, madam, it does concern you much, very much, very much,&quot;<br>
repeating the words, shaking his head; and then turning to the Dutchman,<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; says he, &quot;pray tell her what is the case.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the<br>
merchant, &quot;not yet; let us talk a little farther of it by ourselves;&quot;<br>
upon which they withdrew into another room, where still they talked very<br>
high, but in a language I did not understand. I began to be a little<br>
surprised at what the Jew had said, you may be sure, and eager to know<br>
what he meant, and was very impatient till the Dutch merchant came back,<br>
and that so impatient that I called one of his servants to let him know<br>
I desired to speak with him. When he came in I asked his pardon for<br>
being so impatient, but told him I could not be easy till he had told me<br>
what the meaning of all this was. &quot;Why, madam,&quot; says the Dutch merchant,<br>
&quot;in short, the meaning is what I am surprised at too. This man is a Jew,<br>
and understands jewels perfectly well, and that was the reason I sent<br>
for him, to dispose of them to him for you; but as soon as he saw them,<br>
he knew the jewels very distinctly, and flying out in a passion, as you<br>
see he did, told me, in short, that they were the very parcel of jewels<br>
which the English jeweller had about him who was robbed going to<br>
Versailles, about eight years ago, to show them the Prince de ----, and<br>
that it was for these very jewels that the poor gentleman was murdered;<br>
and he is in all this agony to make me ask you how you came by them; and<br>
he says you ought to be charged with the robbery and murder, and put to<br>
the question to discover who were the persons that did it, that they<br>
might be brought to justice.&quot; While he said this the Jew came impudently<br>
back into the room without calling, which a little surprised me again.<br>
<br>
The Dutch merchant spoke pretty good English, and he knew that the Jew<br>
did not understand English at all, so he told me the latter part, when<br>
he came into the room, in English, at which I smiled, which put the Jew<br>
into his mad fit again, and shaking his head and making his devil's<br>
faces again, he seemed to threaten me for laughing, saying, in French,<br>
this was an affair I should have little reason to laugh at, and the<br>
like. At this I laughed again, and flouted him, letting him see that I<br>
scorned him, and turning to the Dutch merchant, &quot;Sir,&quot; says I, &quot;that<br>
those jewels were belonging to Mr. ----, the English jeweller&quot; (naming<br>
his name readily), &quot;in that,&quot; says I, &quot;this person is right; but that I<br>
should be questioned how I came to have them is a token of his<br>
ignorance, which, however, he might have managed with a little more good<br>
manners, till I told him who I am, and both he and you too will be more<br>
easy in that part when I should tell you that I am the unhappy widow of<br>
that Mr. ---- who was so barbarously murdered going to Versailles, and<br>
that he was not robbed of those jewels, but of others, Mr. ---- having<br>
left those behind him with me, lest he should be robbed. Had I, sir,<br>
come otherwise by them, I should not have been weak enough to have<br>
exposed them to sale here, where the thing was done, but have carried<br>
them farther off.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was an agreeable surprise to the Dutch merchant, who, being an<br>
honest man himself, believed everything I said, which, indeed, being all<br>
really and literally true, except the deficiency of my marriage, I spoke<br>
with such an unconcerned easiness that it might plainly be seen that I<br>
had no guilt upon me, as the Jew suggested.<br>
<br>
The Jew was confounded when he heard that I was the jeweller's wife. But<br>
as I had raised his passion with saying he looked at me with the devil's<br>
face, he studied mischief in his heart, and answered, that should not<br>
serve my turn; so called the Dutchman out again, when he told him that<br>
he resolved to prosecute this matter farther.<br>
<br>
There was one kind chance in this affair, which, indeed, was my<br>
deliverance, and that was, that the fool could not restrain his passion,<br>
but must let it fly to the Dutch merchant, to whom, when they withdrew a<br>
second time, as above, he told that he would bring a process against me<br>
for the murder, and that it should cost me dear for using him at that<br>
rate; and away he went, desiring the Dutch merchant to tell him when I<br>
would be there again. Had he suspected that the Dutchman would have<br>
communicated the particulars to me, he would never have been so foolish<br>
as to have mentioned that part to him.<br>
<br>
But the malice of his thoughts anticipated him, and the Dutch merchant<br>
was so good as to give me an account of his design, which, indeed, was<br>
wicked enough in its nature; but to me it would have been worse than<br>
otherwise it would to another, for, upon examination, I could not have<br>
proved myself to be the wife of the jeweller, so the suspicion might<br>
have been carried on with the better face; and then I should also have<br>
brought all his relations in England upon me, who, finding by the<br>
proceedings that I was not his wife, but a mistress, or, in English, a<br>
whore, would immediately have laid claim to the jewels, as I had owned<br>
them to be his.<br>
<br>
This thought immediately rushed into my head as soon as the Dutch<br>
merchant had told me what wicked things were in the head of that cursed<br>
Jew; and the villain (for so I must call him) convinced the Dutch<br>
merchant that he was in earnest by an expression which showed the rest<br>
of his design, and that was, a plot to get the rest of the jewels into<br>
his hand.<br>
<br>
When first he hinted to the Dutchman that the jewels were such a man's<br>
(meaning my husband's), he made wonderful exclamations on account of<br>
their having been concealed so long. Where must they have lain? And what<br>
was the woman that brought them? And that she (meaning me) ought to be<br>
immediately apprehended and put into the hands of justice. And this was<br>
the time that, as I said, he made such horrid gestures and looked at me<br>
so like a devil.<br>
<br>
The merchant, hearing him talk at that rate, and seeing him in earnest,<br>
said to him, &quot;Hold your tongue a little; this is a thing of consequence.<br>
If it be so, let you and I go into the next room and consider of it<br>
there;&quot; and so they withdrew, and left me.<br>
<br>
Here, as before, I was uneasy, and called him out, and, having heard how<br>
it was, gave him that answer, that I was his wife, or widow, which the<br>
malicious Jew said should not serve my turn. And then it was that the<br>
Dutchman called him out again; and in this time of his withdrawing, the<br>
merchant, finding, as above, that he was really in earnest,<br>
counterfeited a little to be of his mind, and entered into proposals<br>
with him for the thing itself.<br>
<br>
In this they agreed to go to an advocate, or counsel, for directions how<br>
to proceed, and to meet again the next day, against which time the<br>
merchant was to appoint me to come again with the jewels, in order to<br>
sell them. &quot;No,&quot; says the merchant, &quot;I will go farther with her than so;<br>
I will desire her to leave the jewels with me, to show to another<br>
person, in order to get the better price for them.&quot; &quot;That's right,&quot; says<br>
the Jew; &quot;and I'll engage she shall never be mistress of them again;<br>
they shall either be seized by us,&quot; says he, &quot;in the king's name, or she<br>
shall be glad to give them up to us to prevent her being put to the<br>
torture.&quot;<br>
<br>
The merchant said &quot;Yes&quot; to everything he offered, and they agreed to<br>
meet the next morning about it, and I was to be persuaded to leave the<br>
jewels with him, and come to them the next day at four o'clock in order<br>
to make a good bargain for them; and on these conditions they parted.<br>
But the honest Dutchman, filled with indignation at the barbarous<br>
design, came directly to me and told me the whole story. &quot;And now,<br>
madam,&quot; says he, &quot;you are to consider immediately what you have to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
I told him, if I was sure to have justice, I would not fear all that<br>
such a rogue could do to me; but how such things were carried on in<br>
France I knew not. I told him the greatest difficulty would be to prove<br>
our marriage, for that it was done in England, and in a remote part of<br>
England too; and, which was worse, it would be hard to produce authentic<br>
vouchers of it, because we were married in private. &quot;But as to the death<br>
of your husband, madam, what can be said to that?&quot; said he. &quot;Nay,&quot; said<br>
I, &quot;what can they say to it? In England,&quot; added I, &quot;if they would offer<br>
such an injury to any one, they must prove the fact or give just reason<br>
for their suspicions. That my husband was murdered, that every one<br>
knows; but that he was robbed, or of what, or how much, that none<br>
knows--no, not myself; and why was I not questioned for it then? I have<br>
lived in Paris ever since, lived publicly, and no man had yet the<br>
impudence to suggest such a thing of me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am fully satisfied of that,&quot; says the merchant; &quot;but as this is a<br>
rogue who will stick at nothing, what can we say? And who knows what he<br>
may swear? Suppose he should swear that he knows your husband had those<br>
particular jewels with him the morning when he went out, and that he<br>
showed them to him to consider their value, and what price he should ask<br>
the Prince de ---- for them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay, by the same rule,&quot; said I, &quot;he may swear that I murdered my<br>
husband, if he finds it for his turn.&quot; &quot;That's true,&quot; said he; &quot;and if<br>
he should, I do not see what could save you;&quot; but added, &quot;I have found<br>
out his more immediate design. His design is to have you carried to the<br>
Ch&acirc;telet, that the suspicion may appear just, and then to get the jewels<br>
out of your hands if possible; then, at last, to drop the prosecution on<br>
your consenting to quit the jewels to him; and how you will do to avoid<br>
this is the question which I would have you consider of.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My misfortune, sir,&quot; said I, &quot;is that I have no time to consider, and I<br>
have no person to consider with or advise about it. I find that<br>
innocence may be oppressed by such an impudent fellow as this; he that<br>
does not value perjury has any man's life at his mercy. But, sir,&quot; said<br>
I, &quot;is the justice such here that, while I may be in the hands of the<br>
public and under prosecution, he may get hold of my effects and get my<br>
jewels into his hands?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know,&quot; says he, &quot;what may be done in that case; but if not he,<br>
if the court of justice should get hold of them I do not know but you<br>
may find it as difficult to get them out of their hands again, and, at<br>
least, it may cost you half as much as they are worth; so I think it<br>
would be a much better way to prevent their coming at them at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But what course can I take to do that,&quot; says I, &quot;now they have got<br>
notice that I have them? If they get me into their hands they will<br>
oblige me to produce them, or perhaps sentence me to prison till I do.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay,&quot; says he, &quot;as this brute says, too, put you to the question--that<br>
is, to the torture, on pretence of making you confess who were the<br>
murderers of your husband.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Confess!&quot; said I. &quot;How can I confess what I know nothing of?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;If they come to have you to the rack,&quot; said he, &quot;they will make you<br>
confess you did it yourself, whether you did it or no, and then you are<br>
cast.&quot;<br>
<br>
The very word rack frighted me to death almost, and I had no spirit left<br>
in me. &quot;Did it myself!&quot; said I. &quot;That's impossible!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;'tis far from impossible. The most innocent<br>
people in the world have been forced to confess themselves guilty of<br>
what they never heard of, much less had any hand in.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What, then, must I do?&quot; said I. &quot;What would you advise me to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why,&quot; says he, &quot;I would advise you to be gone. You intended to go away<br>
in four or five days, and you may as well go in two days; and if you can<br>
do so, I shall manage it so that he shall not suspect your being gone<br>
for several days after.&quot; Then he told me how the rogue would have me<br>
ordered to bring the jewels the next day for sale, and that then he<br>
would have me apprehended; how he had made the Jew believe he would join<br>
with him in his design, and that he (the merchant) would get the jewels<br>
into his hands. &quot;Now,&quot; says the merchant, &quot;I shall give you bills for<br>
the money you desired, immediately, and such as shall not fail of being<br>
paid. Take your jewels with you, and go this very evening to St.<br>
Germain-en-Laye; I'll send a man thither with you, and from thence he<br>
shall guide you to-morrow to Rouen, where there lies a ship of mine,<br>
just ready to sail for Rotterdam; you shall have your passage in that<br>
ship on my account, and I will send orders for him to sail as soon as<br>
you are on board, and a letter to my friend at Rotterdam to entertain<br>
and take care of you.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was too kind an offer for me, as things stood, not to be accepted,<br>
and be thankful for; and as to going away, I had prepared everything for<br>
parting, so that I had little to do but to go back, take two or three<br>
boxes and bundles, and such things, and my maid Amy, and be gone.<br>
<br>
Then the merchant told me the measures he had resolved to take to delude<br>
the Jew while I made my escape, which was very well contrived indeed.<br>
&quot;First,&quot; said he, &quot;when he comes to-morrow I shall tell him that I<br>
proposed to you to leave the jewels with me, as we agreed, but that you<br>
said you would come and bring them in the afternoon, so that we must<br>
stay for you till four o'clock; but then, at that time, I will show a<br>
letter from you, as if just come in, wherein you shall excuse your not<br>
coming, for that some company came to visit you, and prevented you; but<br>
that you desire me to take care that the gentleman be ready to buy your<br>
jewels, and that you will come to-morrow at the same hour, without<br>
fail.<br>
<br>
&quot;When to-morrow is come, we shall wait at the time, but you not<br>
appearing, I shall seem most dissatisfied, and wonder what can be the<br>
reason; and so we shall agree to go the next day to get out a process<br>
against you. But the next day, in the morning, I'll send to give him<br>
notice that you have been at my house, but he not being there, have made<br>
another appointment, and that I desire to speak with him. When he comes,<br>
I'll tell him you appear perfectly blind as to your danger, and that you<br>
appeared much disappointed that he did not come, though you could not<br>
meet the night before; and obliged me to have him here to-morrow at<br>
three o'clock. When to-morrow comes,&quot; says he, &quot;you shall send word that<br>
you are taken so ill that you cannot come out for that day, but that you<br>
will not fail the next day; and the next day you shall neither come or<br>
send, nor let us ever hear any more of you; for by that time you shall<br>
be in Holland, if you please.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could not but approve all his measures, seeing they were so well<br>
contrived, and in so friendly a manner, for my benefit; and as he seemed<br>
to be so very sincere, I resolved to put my life in his hands.<br>
Immediately I went to my lodgings, and sent away Amy with such bundles<br>
as I had prepared for my travelling. I also sent several parcels of my<br>
fine furniture to the merchant's house to be laid up for me, and<br>
bringing the key of the lodgings with me, I came back to his house. Here<br>
we finished our matters of money, and I delivered into his hands seven<br>
thousand eight hundred pistoles in bills and money, a copy of an<br>
assignment on the townhouse of Paris for four thousand pistoles, at<br>
three per cent. interest, attested, and a procuration for receiving the<br>
interest half-yearly; but the original I kept myself.<br>
<br>
I could have trusted all I had with him, for he was perfectly honest,<br>
and had not the least view of doing me any wrong. Indeed, after it was<br>
so apparent that he had, as it were, saved my life, or at least saved me<br>
from being exposed and ruined--I say, after this, how could I doubt him<br>
in anything?<br>
<br>
When I came to him, he had everything ready as I wanted, and as he had<br>
proposed. As to my money, he gave me first of all an accepted bill,<br>
payable at Rotterdam, for four thousand pistoles, and drawn from Genoa<br>
upon a merchant at Rotterdam, payable to a merchant at Paris, and<br>
endorsed by him to my merchant; this, he assured me, would be punctually<br>
paid; and so it was, to a day. The rest I had in other bills of<br>
exchange, drawn by himself upon other merchants in Holland. Having<br>
secured my jewels too, as well as I could, he sent me away the same<br>
evening in a friend's coach, which he had procured for me, to St.<br>
Germain, and the next morning to Rouen. He also sent a servant of his<br>
own on horseback with me, who provided everything for me, and who<br>
carried his orders to the captain of the ship, which lay about three<br>
miles below Rouen, in the river, and by his directions I went<br>
immediately on board. The third day after I was on board the ship went<br>
away, and we were out at sea the next day after that; and thus I took my<br>
leave of France, and got clear of an ugly business, which, had it gone<br>
on, might have ruined me, and sent me back as naked to England as I was<br>
a little before I left it.<br>
<br>
And now Amy and I were at leisure to look upon the mischiefs that we had<br>
escaped; and had I had any religion or any sense of a Supreme Power,<br>
managing, directing, and governing in both causes and events in this<br>
world, such a case as this would have given anybody room to have been<br>
very thankful to the Power who had not only put such a treasure into my<br>
hand, but given me such an escape from the ruin that threatened me; but<br>
I had none of those things about me. I had, indeed, a grateful sense<br>
upon my mind of the generous friendship of my deliverer, the Dutch<br>
merchant, by whom I was so faithfully served, and by whom, as far as<br>
relates to second causes, I was preserved from destruction.<br>
<br>
I say, I had a grateful sense upon my mind of his kindness and<br>
faithfulness to me, and I resolved to show him some testimony of it as<br>
soon as I came to the end of my rambles, for I was yet but in a state of<br>
uncertainty, and sometimes that gave me a little uneasiness too. I had<br>
paper indeed for my money, and he had showed himself very good to me in<br>
conveying me away, as above; but I had not seen the end of things yet,<br>
for unless the bills were paid, I might still be a great loser by my<br>
Dutchman, and he might, perhaps, have contrived all that affair of the<br>
Jew to put me into a fright and get me to run away, and that as if it<br>
were to save my life; that if the bills should be refused, I was cheated<br>
with a witness, and the like. But these were but surmises, and, indeed,<br>
were perfectly without cause, for the honest man acted as honest men<br>
always do, with an upright and disinterested principle, and with a<br>
sincerity not often to be found in the world. What gain he made by the<br>
exchange was just, and was nothing but what was his due, and was in the<br>
way of his business; but otherwise he made no advantage of me at all.<br>
<br>
When I passed in the ship between Dover and Calais and saw beloved<br>
England once more under my view--England, which I counted my native<br>
country, being the place I was bred up in, though not born there--a<br>
strange kind of joy possessed my mind, and I had such a longing desire<br>
to be there that I would have given the master of the ship twenty<br>
pistoles to have stood over and set me on shore in the Downs; and when<br>
he told me he could not do it--that is, that he durst not do it if I<br>
would have given him a hundred pistoles--I secretly wished that a storm<br>
would rise that might drive the ship over to the coast of England,<br>
whether they would or not, that I might be set on shore anywhere upon<br>
English ground.<br>
<br>
This wicked wish had not been out of my thoughts above two or three<br>
hours, but the master steering away to the north, as was his course to<br>
do, we lost sight of land on that side, and only had the Flemish shore<br>
in view on our right hand, or, as the seamen call it, the starboard<br>
side; and then, with the loss of the sight, the wish for landing in<br>
England abated, and I considered how foolish it was to wish myself out<br>
of the way of my business; that if I had been on shore in England, I<br>
must go back to Holland on account of my bills, which were so<br>
considerable, and I having no correspondence there, that I could not<br>
have managed it without going myself. But we had not been out of sight<br>
of England many hours before the weather began to change; the winds<br>
whistled and made a noise, and the seamen said to one another that it<br>
would blow hard at night. It was then about two hours before sunset, and<br>
we were passed by Dunkirk, and I think they said we were in sight of<br>
Ostend; but then the wind grew high and the sea swelled, and all things<br>
looked terrible, especially to us that understood nothing but just what<br>
we saw before us; in short, night came on, and very dark it was; the<br>
wind freshened and blew harder and harder, and about two hours within<br>
night it blew a terrible storm.<br>
<br>
I was not quite a stranger to the sea, having come from Rochelle to<br>
England when I was a child, and gone from London, by the River Thames,<br>
to France afterward, as I have said. But I began to be alarmed a little<br>
with the terrible clamour of the men over my head, for I had never been<br>
in a storm, and so had never seen the like, or heard it; and once<br>
offering to look out at the door of the steerage, as they called it, it<br>
struck me with such horror (the darkness, the fierceness of the wind,<br>
the dreadful height of the waves, and the hurry the Dutch sailors were<br>
in, whose language I did not understand one word of, neither when they<br>
cursed or when they prayed); I say, all these things together filled me<br>
with terror, and, in short, I began to be very much frighted.<br>
<br>
When I was come back into the great cabin, there sat Amy, who was very<br>
sea-sick, and I had a little before given her a sup of cordial waters to<br>
help her stomach. When Amy saw me come back and sit down without<br>
speaking, for so I did, she looked two or three times up at me; at last<br>
she came running to me. &quot;Dear madam,&quot; says she, &quot;what is the matter?<br>
What makes you look so pale? Why, you an't well; what is the matter?&quot; I<br>
said nothing still, but held up my hands two or three times. Amy doubled<br>
her importunities; upon that I said no more but, &quot;Step to the<br>
steerage-door, and look out, as I did;&quot; so she went away immediately,<br>
and looked too, as I had bidden her; but the poor girl came back again<br>
in the greatest amazement and horror that ever I saw any poor creature<br>
in, wringing her hands and crying out she was undone! she was undone!<br>
she should be drowned! they were all lost! Thus she ran about the cabin<br>
like a mad thing, and as perfectly out of her senses as any one in such<br>
a case could be supposed to be. I was frighted myself, but when I saw<br>
the girl in such a terrible agony, it brought me a little to myself, and<br>
I began to talk to her and put her in a little hope. I told her there<br>
was many a ship in a storm that was not cast away, and I hoped we should<br>
not be drowned; that it was true the storm was very dreadful, but I did<br>
not see that the seamen were so much concerned as we were. And so I<br>
talked to her as well as I could, though my heart was full enough of it,<br>
as well as Amy's; and death began to stare in my face; ay, and something<br>
else too--that is to say, conscience, and my mind was very much<br>
disturbed; but I had nobody to comfort me.<br>
<br>
But Amy being in so much worse a condition--that is to say, so much more<br>
terrified at the storm than I was--I had something to do to comfort her.<br>
She was, as I have said, like one distracted, and went raving about the<br>
cabin, crying out she was undone! undone! she should be drowned! and the<br>
like. And at last, the ship giving a jerk, by the force, I suppose, of<br>
some violent wave, it threw poor Amy quite down, for she was weak enough<br>
before with being sea-sick, and as it threw her forward, the poor girl<br>
struck her head against the bulk-head, as the seamen call it, of the<br>
cabin, and laid her as dead as a stone upon the floor or deck; that is<br>
to say, she was so to all appearance.<br>
<br>
I cried out for help, but it had been all one to have cried out on the<br>
top of a mountain where nobody had been within five miles of me, for the<br>
seamen were so engaged and made so much noise that nobody heard me or<br>
came near me. I opened the great cabin door, and looked into the<br>
steerage to cry for help, but there, to increase my fright, was two<br>
seamen on their knees at prayers, and only one man who steered, and he<br>
made a groaning noise too, which I took to be saying his prayers, but it<br>
seems it was answering to those above, when they called to him to tell<br>
him which way to steer.<br>
<br>
Here was no help for me, or for poor Amy, and there she lay still so,<br>
and in such a condition, that I did not know whether she was dead or<br>
alive. In this fright I went to her, and lifted her a little way up,<br>
setting her on the deck, with her back to the boards of the bulk-head;<br>
and I got a little bottle out of my pocket, and I held it to her nose,<br>
and rubbed her temples and what else I could do, but still Amy showed no<br>
signs of life, till I felt for her pulse, but could hardly distinguish<br>
her to be alive. However, after a great while, she began to revive, and<br>
in about half-an-hour she came to herself, but remembered nothing at<br>
first of what had happened to her for a good while more.<br>
<br>
When she recovered more fully, she asked me where she was. I told her<br>
she was in the ship yet, but God knows how long it might be. &quot;Why,<br>
madam,&quot; says she, &quot;is not the storm over?&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; says I, &quot;Amy.&quot;<br>
&quot;Why, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;it was calm just now&quot; (meaning when she was in<br>
the swooning fit occasioned by her fall). &quot;Calm, Amy!&quot; says I. &quot;'Tis far<br>
from calm. It may be it will be calm by-and-by, when we are all drowned<br>
and gone to heaven.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Heaven, madam!&quot; says she. &quot;What makes you talk so? Heaven! I go to<br>
heaven! No, no; if I am drowned I am damned! Don't you know what a<br>
wicked creature I have been? I have been a whore to two men, and have<br>
lived a wretched, abominable life of vice and wickedness for fourteen<br>
years. Oh, madam! you know it, and God knows it, and now I am to die--to<br>
be drowned! Oh! what will become of me? I am undone for ever!--ay,<br>
madam, for ever! to all eternity! Oh! I am lost! I am lost! If I am<br>
drowned, I am lost for ever!&quot;<br>
<br>
All these, you will easily suppose, must be so many stabs into the very<br>
soul of one in my own case. It immediately occurred to me, &quot;Poor Amy!<br>
what art thou that I am not? What hast thou been that I have not been?<br>
Nay, I am guilty of my own sin and thine too.&quot; Then it came to my<br>
remembrance that I had not only been the same with Amy, but that I had<br>
been the devil's instrument to make her wicked; that I had stripped her,<br>
and prostituted her to the very man that I had been naught with myself;<br>
that she had but followed me, I had been her wicked example; and I had<br>
led her into all; and that, as we had sinned together, now we were<br>
likely to sink together.<br>
<br>
All this repeated itself to my thoughts at that very moment, and every<br>
one of Amy's cries sounded thus in my ears: &quot;I am the wicked cause of it<br>
all! I have been thy ruin, Amy! I have brought thee to this, and now<br>
thou art to suffer for the sin I have enticed thee to! And if thou art<br>
lost for ever, what must I be? what must be my portion?&quot;<br>
<br>
It is true this difference was between us, that I said all these things<br>
within myself, and sighed and mourned inwardly; but Amy, as her temper<br>
was more violent, spoke aloud, and cried, and called out aloud, like one<br>
in agony.<br>
<br>
I had but small encouragement to give her, and indeed could say but very<br>
little, but I got her to compose herself a little, and not let any of<br>
the people of the ship understand what she meant or what she said; but<br>
even in her greatest composure she continued to express herself with the<br>
utmost dread and terror on account of the wicked life she had lived,<br>
crying out she should be damned, and the like, which was very terrible<br>
to me, who knew what condition I was in myself.<br>
<br>
Upon these serious considerations, I was very penitent too for my former<br>
sins, and cried out, though softly, two or three times, &quot;Lord, have<br>
mercy upon me!&quot; To this I added abundance of resolutions of what a life<br>
I would live if it should please God but to spare my life but this one<br>
time; how I would live a single and a virtuous life, and spend a great<br>
deal of what I had thus wickedly got in acts of charity and doing good.<br>
<br>
Under these dreadful apprehensions I looked back on the life I had led<br>
with the utmost contempt and abhorrence. I blushed, and wondered at<br>
myself how I could act thus, how I could divest myself of modesty and<br>
honour, and prostitute myself for gain; and I thought, if ever it should<br>
please God to spare me this one time from death, it would not be<br>
possible that I should be the same creature again.<br>
<br>
Amy went farther; she prayed, she resolved, she vowed to lead a new<br>
life, if God would spare her but this time. It now began to be daylight,<br>
for the storm held all night long, and it was some comfort to see the<br>
light of another day, which none of us expected; but the sea went<br>
mountains high, and the noise of the water was as frightful to us as the<br>
sight of the waves; nor was any land to be seen, nor did the seamen know<br>
whereabout they were. At last, to our great joy, they made land, which<br>
was in England, and on the coast of Suffolk; and the ship being in the<br>
utmost distress, they ran for the shore at all hazards, and with great<br>
difficulty got into Harwich, where they were safe, as to the danger of<br>
death; but the ship was so full of water and so much damaged that if<br>
they had not laid her on shore the same day she would have sunk before<br>
night, according to the opinion of the seamen, and of the workmen on<br>
shore too who were hired to assist them in stopping their leaks.<br>
<br>
Amy was revived as soon as she heard they had espied land, and went out<br>
upon the deck; but she soon came in again to me. &quot;Oh, madam!&quot; says she,<br>
&quot;there's the land indeed to be seen. It looks like a ridge of clouds,<br>
and may be all a cloud for aught I know; but if it be land, 'tis a<br>
great way off, and the sea is in such a combustion, we shall all perish<br>
before we can reach it. 'Tis the dreadfullest sight to look at the<br>
waves that ever was seen. Why, they are as high as mountains; we shall<br>
certainly be all swallowed up, for all the land is so near.&quot;<br>
<br>
I had conceived some hope that, if they saw land, we should be<br>
delivered; and I told her she did not understand things of that nature;<br>
that she might be sure if they saw land they would go directly towards<br>
it, and would make into some harbour; but it was, as Amy said, a<br>
frightful distance to it. The land looked like clouds, and the sea went<br>
as high as mountains, so that no hope appeared in the seeing the land,<br>
but we were in fear of foundering before we could reach it. This made<br>
Amy so desponding still; but as the wind, which blew from the east, or<br>
that way, drove us furiously towards the land, so when, about<br>
half-an-hour after, I stepped to the steerage-door and looked out, I saw<br>
the land much nearer than Amy represented it; so I went in and<br>
encouraged Amy again, and indeed was encouraged myself.<br>
<br>
In about an hour, or something more, we saw, to our infinite<br>
satisfaction, the open harbour of Harwich, and the vessel standing<br>
directly towards it, and in a few minutes more the ship was in smooth<br>
water, to our inexpressible comfort; and thus I had, though against my<br>
will and contrary to my true interest, what I wished for, to be driven<br>
away to England, though it was by a storm.<br>
<br>
Nor did this incident do either Amy or me much service, for, the danger<br>
being over, the fears of death vanished with it; ay, and our fear of<br>
what was beyond death also. Our sense of the life we had lived went off,<br>
and with our return to life our wicked taste of life returned, and we<br>
were both the same as before, if not worse. So certain is it that the<br>
repentance which is brought about by the mere apprehensions of death<br>
wears off as those apprehensions wear off, and deathbed repentance, or<br>
storm repentance, which is much the same, is seldom true.<br>
<br>
However, I do not tell you that this was all at once neither; the fright<br>
we had at sea lasted a little while afterwards; at least the impression<br>
was not quite blown off as soon as the storm; especially poor Amy. As<br>
soon as she set her foot on shore she fell flat upon the ground and<br>
kissed it, and gave God thanks for her deliverance from the sea; and<br>
turning to me when she got up, &quot;I hope, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;you will<br>
never go upon the sea again.&quot;<br>
<br>
I know not what ailed me, not I; but Amy was much more penitent at sea,<br>
and much more sensible of her deliverance when she landed and was safe,<br>
than I was. I was in a kind of stupidity, I know not well what to call<br>
it; I had a mind full of horror in the time of the storm, and saw death<br>
before me as plainly as Amy, but my thoughts got no vent, as Amy's did.<br>
I had a silent, sullen kind of grief, which could not break out either<br>
in words or tears, and which was therefore much the worse to bear.<br>
<br>
I had a terror upon me for my wicked life past, and firmly believed I<br>
was going to the bottom, launching into death, where I was to give an<br>
account of all my past actions; and in this state, and on that account,<br>
I looked back upon my wickedness with abhorrence, as I have said above,<br>
but I had no sense of repentance from the true motive of repentance; I<br>
saw nothing of the corruption of nature, the sin of my life, as an<br>
offence against God, as a thing odious to the holiness of His being, as<br>
abusing His mercy and despising His goodness. In short, I had no<br>
thorough effectual repentance, no sight of my sins in their proper<br>
shape, no view of a Redeemer, or hope in Him. I had only such a<br>
repentance as a criminal has at the place of execution, who is sorry,<br>
not that he has committed the crime, as it is a crime, but sorry that he<br>
is to be hanged for it.<br>
<br>
It is true Amy's repentance wore off too, as well as mine, but not so<br>
soon. However, we were both very grave for a time.<br>
<br>
As soon as we could get a boat from the town we went on shore, and<br>
immediately went to a public-house in the town of Harwich, where we<br>
were to consider seriously what was to be done, and whether we should go<br>
up to London or stay till the ship was refitted, which, they said, would<br>
be a fortnight, and then go for Holland, as we intended, and as business<br>
required.<br>
<br>
Reason directed that I should go to Holland, for there I had all my<br>
money to receive, and there I had persons of good reputation and<br>
character to apply to, having letters to them from the honest Dutch<br>
merchant at Paris, and they might perhaps give me a recommendation again<br>
to merchants in London, and so I should get acquaintance with some<br>
people of figure, which was what I loved; whereas now I knew not one<br>
creature in the whole city of London, or anywhere else, that I could go<br>
and make myself known to. Upon these considerations, I resolved to go to<br>
Holland, whatever came of it.<br>
<br>
But Amy cried and trembled, and was ready to fall into fits, when I did<br>
but mention going upon the sea again, and begged of me not to go, or if<br>
I would go, that I would leave her behind, though I was to send her<br>
a-begging. The people in the inn laughed at her, and jested with her,<br>
asked her if she had any sins to confess that she was ashamed should be<br>
heard of, and that she was troubled with an evil conscience; told her,<br>
if she came to sea, and to be in a storm, if she had lain with her<br>
master, she would certainly tell her mistress of it, and that it was a<br>
common thing for poor maids to confess all the young men they had lain<br>
with; that there was one poor girl that went over with her mistress,<br>
whose husband was a ......r, in ......, in the city of London, who<br>
confessed, in the terror of a storm, that she had lain with her master,<br>
and all the apprentices, so often, and in such-and-such places, and made<br>
the poor mistress, when she returned to London, fly at her husband, and<br>
make such a stir as was indeed the ruin of the whole family. Amy could<br>
bear all that well enough, for though she had indeed lain with her<br>
master, it was with her mistress's knowledge and consent, and, which was<br>
worse, was her mistress's own doing. I record it to the reproach of my<br>
own vice, and to expose the excesses of such wickedness as they deserve<br>
to be exposed.<br>
<br>
I thought Amy's fear would have been over by that time the ship would be<br>
gotten ready, but I found the girl was rather worse and worse; and when<br>
I came to the point that we must go on board or lose the passage, Amy<br>
was so terrified that she fell into fits; so the ship went away without<br>
us.<br>
<br>
But my going being absolutely necessary, as above, I was obliged to go<br>
in the packet-boat some time after, and leave Amy behind at Harwich, but<br>
with directions to go to London and stay there to receive letters and<br>
orders from me what to do. Now I was become, from a lady of pleasure, a<br>
woman of business, and of great business too, I assure you.<br>
<br>
I got me a servant at Harwich to go over with me, who had been at<br>
Rotterdam, knew the place, and spoke the language, which was a great<br>
help to me, and away I went. I had a very quick passage and pleasant<br>
weather, and, coming to Rotterdam, soon found out the merchant to whom I<br>
was recommended, who received me with extraordinary respect. And first<br>
he acknowledged the accepted bill for four thousand pistoles, which he<br>
afterwards paid punctually; other bills that I had also payable at<br>
Amsterdam he procured to be received for me; and whereas one of the<br>
bills for one thousand two hundred crowns was protested at Amsterdam, he<br>
paid it me himself, for the honour of the indorser, as he called it,<br>
which was my friend the merchant at Paris.<br>
<br>
There I entered into a negotiation by his means for my jewels, and he<br>
brought me several jewellers to look on them, and particularly one to<br>
value them, and to tell me what every particular was worth. This was a<br>
man who had great skill in jewels, but did not trade at that time, and<br>
he was desired by the gentleman that I was with to see that I might not<br>
be imposed upon.<br>
<br>
All this work took me up near half a year, and by managing my business<br>
thus myself, and having large sums to do with, I became as expert in it<br>
as any she-merchant of them all. I had credit in the bank for a large<br>
sum of money, and bills and notes for much more.<br>
<br>
After I had been here about three months, my maid Amy writes me word<br>
that she had received a letter from her friend, as she called him. That,<br>
by the way, was the prince's gentleman, that had been Amy's<br>
extraordinary friend indeed, for Amy owned to me he had lain with her a<br>
hundred times, that is to say, as often as he pleased, and perhaps in<br>
the eight years which that affair lasted it might be a great deal<br>
oftener. This was what she called her friend, who she corresponded with<br>
upon this particular subject, and, among other things, sent her this<br>
particular news, that my extraordinary friend, my real husband, who rode<br>
in the _gens d'armes_, was dead, that he was killed in a rencounter, as<br>
they call it, or accidental scuffle among the troopers; and so the jade<br>
congratulated me upon my being now a real free woman. &quot;And now, madam,&quot;<br>
says she at the end of her letter, &quot;you have nothing to do but to come<br>
hither and set up a coach and a good equipage, and if beauty and a good<br>
fortune won't make you a duchess, nothing will.&quot; But I had not fixed my<br>
measures yet. I had no inclination to be a wife again. I had had such<br>
bad luck with my first husband, I hated the thoughts of it. I found<br>
that a wife is treated with indifference, a mistress with a strong<br>
passion; a wife is looked upon as but an upper servant, a mistress is a<br>
sovereign; a wife must give up all she has, have every reserve she makes<br>
for herself be thought hard of, and be upbraided with her very<br>
pin-money, whereas a mistress makes the saying true, that what the man<br>
has is hers, and what she has is her own; the wife bears a thousand<br>
insults, and is forced to sit still and bear it, or part, and be undone;<br>
a mistress insulted helps herself immediately, and takes another.<br>
<br>
These were my wicked arguments for whoring, for I never set against them<br>
the difference another way--I may say, every other way; how that, first,<br>
a wife appears boldly and honourably with her husband, lives at home,<br>
and possesses his house, his servants, his equipages, and has a right to<br>
them all, and to call them her own; entertains his friends, owns his<br>
children, and has the return of duty and affection from them, as they<br>
are here her own, and claims upon his estate, by the custom of England,<br>
if he dies and leaves her a widow.<br>
<br>
The whore skulks about in lodgings, is visited in the dark, disowned<br>
upon all occasions before God and man; is maintained, indeed, for a<br>
time, but is certainly condemned to be abandoned at last, and left to<br>
the miseries of fate and her own just disaster. If she has any<br>
children, her endeavour is to get rid of them, and not maintain them;<br>
and if she lives, she is certain to see them all hate her, and be<br>
ashamed of her. While the vice rages, and the man is in the devil's<br>
hand, she has him; and while she has him, she makes a prey of him; but<br>
if he happens to fall sick, if any disaster befalls him, the cause of<br>
all lies upon her. He is sure to lay all his misfortunes at her door;<br>
and if once he comes to repentance, or makes but one step towards a<br>
reformation, he begins with her--leaves her, uses her as she deserves,<br>
hates her, abhors her, and sees her no more; and that with this<br>
never-failing addition, namely, that the more sincere and unfeigned his<br>
repentance is, the more earnestly he looks up, and the more effectually<br>
he looks in, the more his aversion to her increases, and he curses her<br>
from the bottom of his soul; nay, it must be a kind of excess of charity<br>
if he so much as wishes God may forgive her.<br>
<br>
The opposite circumstances of a wife and whore are such and so many, and<br>
I have since seen the difference with such eyes, as I could dwell upon<br>
the subject a great while; but my business is history. I had a long<br>
scene of folly yet to run over. Perhaps the moral of all my story may<br>
bring me back again to this part, and if it does I shall speak of it<br>
fully.<br>
<br>
While I continued in Holland I received several letters from my friend<br>
(so I had good reason to call him) the merchant in Paris, in which he<br>
gave me a farther account of the conduct of that rogue the Jew, and how<br>
he acted after I was gone; how impatient he was while the said merchant<br>
kept him in suspense, expecting me to come again; and how he raged when<br>
he found I came no more.<br>
<br>
It seems, after he found I did not come, he found out by his unwearied<br>
inquiry where I had lived, and that I had been kept as a mistress by<br>
some great person; but he could never learn by who, except that he<br>
learnt the colour of his livery. In pursuit of this inquiry he guessed<br>
at the right person, but could not make it out, or offer any positive<br>
proof of it; but he found out the prince's gentleman, and talked so<br>
saucily to him of it that the gentleman treated him, as the French call<br>
it, _&agrave; coup de baton_--that is to say, caned him very severely, as he<br>
deserved; and that not satisfying him, or curing his insolence, he was<br>
met one night late upon the Pont Neuf, in Paris, by two men, who,<br>
muffling him up in a great cloak, carried him into a more private place<br>
and cut off both his ears, telling him it was for talking impudently of<br>
his superiors; adding that he should take care to govern his tongue<br>
better and behave with more manners, or the next time they would cut his<br>
tongue out of his head.<br>
<br>
This put a check to his sauciness that way; but he comes back to the<br>
merchant and threatened to begin a process against him for corresponding<br>
with me, and being accessory to the murder of the jeweller, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The merchant found by his discourse that he supposed I was protected by<br>
the said Prince de ----; nay, the rogue said he was sure I was in his<br>
lodgings at Versailles, for he never had so much as the least intimation<br>
of the way I was really gone; but that I was there he was certain, and<br>
certain that the merchant was privy to it. The merchant bade him<br>
defiance. However, he gave him a great deal of trouble and put him to a<br>
great charge, and had like to have brought him in for a party to my<br>
escape; in which case he would have been obliged to have produced me,<br>
and that in the penalty of some capital sum of money.<br>
<br>
But the merchant was too many for him another way, for he brought an<br>
information against him for a cheat; wherein laying down the whole fact,<br>
how he intended falsely to accuse the widow of the jeweller for the<br>
supposed murder of her husband; that he did it purely to get the jewels<br>
from her; and that he offered to bring him (the merchant) in, to be<br>
confederate with him, and to share the jewels between them; proving also<br>
his design to get the jewels into his hands, and then to have dropped<br>
the prosecution upon condition of my quitting the jewels to him. Upon<br>
this charge he got him laid by the heels; so he was sent to the<br>
Conciergerie--that is to say, to Bridewell--and the merchant cleared. He<br>
got out of jail in a little while, though not without the help of money,<br>
and continued teasing the merchant a long while, and at last threatening<br>
to assassinate and murder him. So the merchant, who, having buried his<br>
wife about two months before, was now a single man, and not knowing what<br>
such a villain might do, thought fit to quit Paris, and came away to<br>
Holland also.<br>
<br>
It is most certain that, speaking of originals, I was the source and<br>
spring of all that trouble and vexation to this honest gentleman; and as<br>
it was afterwards in my power to have made him full satisfaction, and<br>
did not, I cannot say but I added ingratitude to all the rest of my<br>
follies; but of that I shall give a fuller account presently.<br>
<br>
I was surprised one morning, when, being at the merchant's house who he<br>
had recommended me to in Rotterdam, and being busy in his<br>
counting-house, managing my bills, and preparing to write a letter to<br>
him to Paris, I heard a noise of horses at the door, which is not very<br>
common in a city where everybody passes by water; but he had, it seems,<br>
ferried over the Maas from Willemstadt, and so came to the very door,<br>
and I, looking towards the door upon hearing the horses, saw a gentleman<br>
alight and come in at the gate. I knew nothing, and expected nothing,<br>
to be sure, of the person; but, as I say, was surprised, and indeed more<br>
than ordinarily surprised, when, coming nearer to me, I saw it was my<br>
merchant of Paris, my benefactor, and indeed my deliverer.<br>
<br>
I confess it was an agreeable surprise to me, and I was exceeding glad<br>
to see him, who was so honourable and so kind to me, and who indeed had<br>
saved my life. As soon as he saw me he ran to me, took me in his arms,<br>
and kissed me with a freedom that he never offered to take with me<br>
before. &quot;Dear Madam ----,&quot; says he, &quot;I am glad to see you safe in this<br>
country; if you had stayed two days longer in Paris you had been<br>
undone.&quot; I was so glad to see him that I could not speak a good while,<br>
and I burst out into tears without speaking a word for a minute; but I<br>
recovered that disorder, and said, &quot;The more, sir, is my obligation to<br>
you that saved my life;&quot; and added, &quot;I am glad to see you here, that I<br>
may consider how to balance an account in which I am so much your<br>
debtor.&quot; &quot;You and I will adjust that matter easily,&quot; says he, &quot;now we<br>
are so near together. Pray where do you lodge?&quot; says he.<br>
<br>
&quot;In a very honest, good house,&quot; said I, &quot;where that gentleman, your<br>
friend, recommended me,&quot; pointing to the merchant in whose house we then<br>
were.<br>
<br>
&quot;And where you may lodge too, sir,&quot; says the gentleman, &quot;if it suits<br>
with your business and your other conveniency.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;With all my heart,&quot; says he. &quot;Then, madam,&quot; adds he, turning to me, &quot;I<br>
shall be near you, and have time to tell you a story which will be very<br>
long, and yet many ways very pleasant to you; how troublesome that<br>
devilish fellow, the Jew, has been to me on your account, and what a<br>
hellish snare he had laid for you, if he could have found you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall have leisure too, sir,&quot; said I, &quot;to tell you all my adventures<br>
since that, which have not been a few, I assure you.&quot;<br>
<br>
In short, he took up his lodgings in the same house where I lodged, and<br>
the room he lay in opened, as he was wishing it would, just opposite to<br>
my lodging-room, so we could almost call out of bed to one another; and<br>
I was not at all shy of him on that score, for I believed him perfectly<br>
honest, and so indeed he was; and if he had not, that article was at<br>
present no part of my concern.<br>
<br>
It was not till two or three days, and after his first hurries of<br>
business were over, that we began to enter into the history of our<br>
affairs on every side, but when we began, it took up all our<br>
conversation for almost a fortnight. First, I gave him a particular<br>
account of everything that happened material upon my voyage, and how we<br>
were driven into Harwich by a very terrible storm; how I had left my<br>
woman behind me, so frighted with the danger she had been in that she<br>
durst not venture to set her foot into a ship again any more, and that I<br>
had not come myself if the bills I had of him had not been payable in<br>
Holland; but that money, he might see, would make a woman go anywhere.<br>
<br>
He seemed to laugh at all our womanish fears upon the occasion of the<br>
storm, telling me it was nothing but what was very ordinary in those<br>
seas, but that they had harbours on every coast so near that they were<br>
seldom in danger of being lost indeed. &quot;For,&quot; says he, &quot;if they cannot<br>
fetch one coast, they can always stand away for another, and run afore<br>
it,&quot; as he called it, &quot;for one side or other.&quot; But when I came to tell<br>
him what a crazy ship it was, and how, even when they got into Harwich,<br>
and into smooth water, they were fain to run the ship on shore, or she<br>
would have sunk in the very harbour; and when I told him that when I<br>
looked out at the cabin-door I saw the Dutchmen, one upon his knees<br>
here, and another there, at their prayers, then indeed he acknowledged I<br>
had reason to be alarmed; but, smiling, he added, &quot;But you, madam,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;are so good a lady, and so pious, you would but have gone to heaven<br>
a little the sooner; the difference had not been much to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I confess when he said this it made all the blood turn in my veins, and<br>
I thought I should have fainted. &quot;Poor gentleman,&quot; thought I, &quot;you know<br>
little of me. What would I give to be really what you really think me to<br>
be!&quot; He perceived the disorder, but said nothing till I spoke; when,<br>
shaking my head, &quot;Oh, sir!&quot; said I, &quot;death in any shape has some terror<br>
in it, but in the frightful figure of a storm at sea and a sinking ship,<br>
it comes with a double, a treble, and indeed an inexpressible horror;<br>
and if I were that saint you think me to be (which God knows I am not),<br>
it is still very dismal. I desire to die in a calm, if I can.&quot; He said a<br>
great many good things, and very prettily ordered his discourse between<br>
serious reflection and compliment, but I had too much guilt to relish it<br>
as it was meant, so I turned it off to something else, and talked of the<br>
necessity I had on me to come to Holland, but I wished myself safe on<br>
shore in England again.<br>
<br>
He told me he was glad I had such an obligation upon me to come over<br>
into Holland, however, but hinted that he was so interested in my<br>
welfare, and, besides, had such further designs upon me, that if I had<br>
not so happily been found in Holland he was resolved to have gone to<br>
England to see me, and that it was one of the principal reasons of his<br>
leaving Paris.<br>
<br>
I told him I was extremely obliged to him for so far interesting himself<br>
in my affairs, but that I had been so far his debtor before that I knew<br>
not how anything could increase the debt; for I owed my life to him<br>
already, and I could not be in debt for anything more valuable than<br>
that. He answered in the most obliging manner possible, that he would<br>
put it in my power to pay that debt, and all the obligations besides<br>
that ever he had, or should be able to lay upon me.<br>
<br>
I began to understand him now, and to see plainly that he resolved to<br>
make love to me, but I would by no means seem to take the hint; and,<br>
besides, I knew that he had a wife with him in Paris; and I had, just<br>
then at least, no gust to any more intriguing. However, he surprised me<br>
into a sudden notice of the thing a little while after by saying<br>
something in his discourse that he did, as he said, in his wife's days.<br>
I started at that word, &quot;What mean you by that, sir?&quot; said I. &quot;Have you<br>
not a wife at Paris?&quot; &quot;No, madam, indeed,&quot; said he; &quot;my wife died the<br>
beginning of September last,&quot; which, it seems, was but a little after I<br>
came away.<br>
<br>
We lived in the same house all this while, and as we lodged not far off<br>
of one another, opportunities were not wanting of as near an<br>
acquaintance as we might desire; nor have such opportunities the least<br>
agency in vicious minds to bring to pass even what they might not intend<br>
at first.<br>
<br>
However, though he courted so much at a distance, yet his pretensions<br>
were very honourable; and as I had before found him a most<br>
disinterested friend, and perfectly honest in his dealings, even when I<br>
trusted him with all I had, so now I found him strictly virtuous, till I<br>
made him otherwise myself, even almost whether he would or no, as you<br>
shall hear.<br>
<br>
It was not long after our former discourse, when he repeated what he had<br>
insinuated before, namely, that he had yet a design to lay before me,<br>
which, if I would agree to his proposals, would more than balance all<br>
accounts between us. I told him I could not reasonably deny him<br>
anything; and except one thing, which I hoped and believed he would not<br>
think of, I should think myself very ungrateful if I did not do<br>
everything for him that lay in my power.<br>
<br>
He told me what he should desire of me would be fully in my power to<br>
grant, or else he should be very unfriendly to offer it; and still all<br>
this while he declined making the proposal, as he called it, and so for<br>
that time we ended our discourse, turning it off to other things. So<br>
that, in short, I began to think he might have met with some disaster in<br>
his business, and might have come away from Paris in some discredit, or<br>
had had some blow on his affairs in general; and as really I had<br>
kindness enough to have parted with a good sum to have helped him, and<br>
was in gratitude bound to have done so, he having so effectually saved<br>
to me all I had, so I resolved to make him the offer the first time I<br>
had an opportunity, which two or three days after offered itself, very<br>
much to my satisfaction.<br>
<br>
He had told me at large, though on several occasions, the treatment he<br>
had met with from the Jew, and what expense he had put him to; how at<br>
length he had cast him, as above, and had recovered good damage of him,<br>
but that the rogue was unable to make him any considerable reparation.<br>
He had told me also how the Prince de ----'s gentleman had resented his<br>
treatment of his master, and how he had caused him to be used upon the<br>
Pont Neuf, &amp;c., as I have mentioned above, which I laughed at most<br>
heartily.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a pity,&quot; said I, &quot;that I should sit here and make that gentleman<br>
no amends; if you would direct me, sir,&quot; said I, &quot;how to do it, I would<br>
make him a handsome present, and acknowledge the justice he had done to<br>
me, as well as to the prince, his master.&quot; He said he would do what I<br>
directed in it; so I told him I would send him five hundred crowns.<br>
&quot;That's too much,&quot; said he, &quot;for you are but half interested in the<br>
usage of the Jew; it was on his master's account he corrected him, not<br>
on yours.&quot; Well, however, we were obliged to do nothing in it, for<br>
neither of us knew how to direct a letter to him, or to direct anybody<br>
to him; so I told him I would leave it till I came to England, for that<br>
my woman, Amy, corresponded with him, and that he had made love to her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, but, sir,&quot; said I, &quot;as, in requital for his generous concern for<br>
me, I am careful to think of him, it is but just that what expense you<br>
have been obliged to be at, which was all on my account, should be<br>
repaid you; and therefore,&quot; said I, &quot;let me see--.&quot; And there I paused,<br>
and began to reckon up what I had observed, from his own discourse, it<br>
had cost him in the several disputes and hearings which he had with that<br>
dog of a Jew, and I cast them up at something above 2130 crowns; so I<br>
pulled out some bills which I had upon a merchant in Amsterdam, and a<br>
particular account in bank, and was looking on them in order to give<br>
them to him; when he, seeing evidently what I was going about,<br>
interrupted me with some warmth, and told me he would have nothing of me<br>
on that account, and desired I would not pull out my bills and papers on<br>
that score; that he had not told me the story on that account, or with<br>
any such view; that it had been his misfortune first to bring that ugly<br>
rogue to me, which, though it was with a good design, yet he would<br>
punish himself with the expense he had been at for his being so unlucky<br>
to me; that I could not think so hard of him as to suppose he would take<br>
money of me, a widow, for serving me, and doing acts of kindness to me<br>
in a strange country, and in distress too; but he said he would repeat<br>
what he had said before, that he kept me for a deeper reckoning, and<br>
that, as he had told me, he would put me into a posture to even all that<br>
favour, as I called it, at once, so we should talk it over another time,<br>
and balance all together.<br>
<br>
Now I expected it would come out, but still he put it off, as before,<br>
from whence I concluded it could not be matter of love, for that those<br>
things are not usually delayed in such a manner, and therefore it must<br>
be matter of money. Upon which thought I broke the silence, and told<br>
him, that as he knew I had, by obligation, more kindness for him than to<br>
deny any favour to him that I could grant, and that he seemed backward<br>
to mention his case, I begged leave of him to give me leave to ask him<br>
whether anything lay upon his mind with respect to his business and<br>
effects in the world; that if it did, he knew what I had in the world as<br>
well as I did, and that, if he wanted money, I would let him have any<br>
sum for his occasion, as far as five or six thousand pistoles, and he<br>
should pay me as his own affairs would permit; and that, if he never<br>
paid me, I would assure him that I would never give him any trouble for<br>
it.<br>
<br>
He rose up with ceremony, and gave me thanks in terms that sufficiently<br>
told me he had been bred among people more polite and more courteous<br>
than is esteemed the ordinary usage of the Dutch; and after his<br>
compliment was over he came nearer to me, and told me he was obliged to<br>
assure me, though with repeated acknowledgments of my kind offer, that<br>
he was not in any want of money; that he had met with no uneasiness in<br>
any of his affairs--no, not of any kind whatever, except that of the<br>
loss of his wife and one of his children, which indeed had troubled him<br>
much; but that this was no part of what he had to offer me, and by<br>
granting which I should balance all obligations; but that, in short, it<br>
was that, seeing Providence had (as it were for that purpose) taken his<br>
wife from him, I would make up the loss to him; and with that he held me<br>
fast in his arms, and, kissing me, would not give me leave to say no,<br>
and hardly to breathe.<br>
<br>
At length, having got room to speak, I told him that, as I had said<br>
before, I could deny him but one thing in the world; I was very sorry he<br>
should propose that thing only that I could not grant.<br>
<br>
I could not but smile, however, to myself that he should make so many<br>
circles and roundabout motions to come at a discourse which had no such<br>
rarity at the bottom of it, if he had known all. But there was another<br>
reason why I resolved not to have him, when, at the same time, if he had<br>
courted me in a manner less honest or virtuous, I believe I should not<br>
have denied him; but I shall come to that part presently.<br>
<br>
He was, as I have said, long a-bringing it out, but when he had brought<br>
it out he pursued it with such importunities as would admit of no<br>
denial; at least he intended they should not; but I resisted them<br>
obstinately, and yet with expressions of the utmost kindness and respect<br>
for him that could be imagined, often telling him there was nothing else<br>
in the world that I could deny him, and showing him all the respect, and<br>
upon all occasions treating him with intimacy and freedom, as if he had<br>
been my brother.<br>
<br>
He tried all the ways imaginable to bring his design to pass, but I was<br>
inflexible. At last he thought of a way which, he flattered himself,<br>
would not fail; nor would he have been mistaken, perhaps, in any other<br>
woman in the world but me. This was, to try if he could take me at an<br>
advantage and get to bed to me, and then, as was most rational to think,<br>
I should willingly enough marry him afterwards.<br>
<br>
We were so intimate together that nothing but man and wife could, or at<br>
least ought, to be more; but still our freedoms kept within the bounds<br>
of modesty and decency. But one evening, above all the rest, we were<br>
very merry, and I fancied he pushed the mirth to watch for his<br>
advantage, and I resolved that I would at least feign to be as merry as<br>
he; and that, in short, if he offered anything he should have his will<br>
easily enough.<br>
<br>
About one o'clock in the morning--for so long we sat up together--I<br>
said, &quot;Come, 'tis one o'clock; I must go to bed.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;I'll<br>
go with you.&quot; &quot;No, no;&quot; says I; &quot;go to your own chamber.&quot; He said he<br>
would go to bed with me. &quot;Nay,&quot; says I, &quot;if you will, I don't know what<br>
to say; if I can't help it, you must.&quot; However, I got from him, left<br>
him, and went into my chamber, but did not shut the door, and as he<br>
could easily see that I was undressing myself, he steps to his own room,<br>
which was but on the same floor, and in a few minutes undresses himself<br>
also, and returns to my door in his gown and slippers.<br>
<br>
I thought he had been gone indeed, and so that he had been in jest; and,<br>
by the way, thought either he had no mind to the thing, or that he never<br>
intended it; so I shut my door--that is, latched it, for I seldom locked<br>
or bolted it--and went to bed. I had not been in bed a minute but he<br>
comes in his gown to the door and opens it a little way, but not enough<br>
to come in or look in, and says softly, &quot;What! are you really gone to<br>
bed?&quot; &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; says I; &quot;get you gone.&quot; &quot;No, indeed,&quot; says he, &quot;I<br>
shall not be gone; you gave me leave before to come to bed, and you<br>
shan't say 'Get you gone' now.&quot; So he comes into my room, and then<br>
turns about and fastens the door, and immediately comes to the bedside<br>
to me. I pretended to scold and struggle, and bid him begone with more<br>
warmth than before; but it was all one; he had not a rag of clothes on<br>
but his gown and slippers and shirt, so he throws off his gown, and<br>
throws open the bed, and came in at once.<br>
<br>
I made a seeming resistance, but it was no more indeed; for, as above, I<br>
resolved from the beginning he should lie with me if he would, and, for<br>
the rest, I left it to come after.<br>
<br>
Well, he lay with me that night, and the two next, and very merry we<br>
were all the three days between; but the third night he began to be a<br>
little more grave. &quot;Now, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;though I have pushed this<br>
matter farther than ever I intended, or than I believe you expected from<br>
me, who never made any pretences to you but what were very honest, yet<br>
to heal it all up, and let you see how sincerely I meant at first, and<br>
how honest I will ever be to you, I am ready to marry you still, and<br>
desire you to let it be done to-morrow morning; and I will give you the<br>
same fair conditions of marriage as I would have done before.&quot;<br>
<br>
This, it must be owned, was a testimony that he was very honest, and<br>
that he loved me sincerely; but I construed it quite another way,<br>
namely, that he aimed at the money. But how surprised did he look, and<br>
how was he confounded, when he found me receive his proposal with<br>
coldness and indifference, and still tell him that it was the only thing<br>
I could not grant!<br>
<br>
He was astonished. &quot;What! not take me now,&quot; says he, &quot;when I have been<br>
abed with you!&quot; I answered coldly, though respectfully still, &quot;It is<br>
true, to my shame be it spoken,&quot; says I, &quot;that you have taken me by<br>
surprise, and have had your will of me; but I hope you will not take it<br>
ill that I cannot consent to marry for all that. If I am with child,&quot;<br>
said I, &quot;care must be taken to manage that as you shall direct; I hope<br>
you won't expose me for my having exposed myself to you, but I cannot go<br>
any farther.&quot; And at that point I stood, and would hear of no matrimony<br>
by any means.<br>
<br>
Now, because this may seem a little odd, I shall state the matter<br>
clearly, as I understood it myself. I knew that, while I was a mistress,<br>
it is customary for the person kept to receive from them that keep; but<br>
if I should be a wife, all I had then was given up to the husband, and I<br>
was henceforth to be under his authority only; and as I had money<br>
enough, and needed not fear being what they call a cast-off mistress, so<br>
I had no need to give him twenty thousand pounds to marry me, which had<br>
been buying my lodging too dear a great deal.<br>
<br>
Thus his project of coming to bed to me was a bite upon himself, while<br>
he intended it for a bite upon me; and he was no nearer his aim of<br>
marrying me than he was before. All his arguments he could urge upon the<br>
subject of matrimony were at an end, for I positively declined marrying<br>
him; and as he had refused the thousand pistoles which I had offered him<br>
in compensation for his expenses and loss at Paris with the Jew, and had<br>
done it upon the hopes he had of marrying me, so when he found his way<br>
difficult still, he was amazed, and, I had some reason to believe,<br>
repented that he had refused the money.<br>
<br>
But thus it is when men run into wicked measures to bring their designs<br>
about. I, that was infinitely obliged to him before, began to talk to<br>
him as if I had balanced accounts with him now, and that the favour of<br>
lying with a whore was equal, not to the thousand pistoles only, but to<br>
all the debt I owed him for saving my life and all my effects.<br>
<br>
But he drew himself into it, and though it was a dear bargain, yet it<br>
was a bargain of his own making; he could not say I had tricked him into<br>
it. But as he projected and drew me in to lie with him, depending that<br>
was a sure game in order to a marriage, so I granted him the favour, as<br>
he called it, to balance the account of favours received from him, and<br>
keep the thousand pistoles with a good grace.<br>
<br>
He was extremely disappointed in this article, and knew not how to<br>
manage for a great while; and as I dare say, if he had not expected to<br>
have made it an earnest for marrying me, he would not have attempted me<br>
the other way, so, I believed, if it had not been for the money which he<br>
knew I had, he would never have desired to marry me after he had lain<br>
with me. For where is the man that cares to marry a whore, though of his<br>
own making? And as I knew him to be no fool, so I did him no wrong when<br>
I supposed that, but for the money, he would not have had any thoughts<br>
of me that way, especially after my yielding as I had done; in which it<br>
is to be remembered that I made no capitulation for marrying him when I<br>
yielded to him, but let him do just what he pleased, without any<br>
previous bargain.<br>
<br>
Well, hitherto we went upon guesses at one another's designs; but as he<br>
continued to importune me to marry, though he had lain with me, and<br>
still did lie with me as often as he pleased, and I continued to refuse<br>
to marry him, though I let him lie with me whenever he desired it; I<br>
say, as these two circumstances made up our conversation, it could not<br>
continue long thus, but we must come to an explanation.<br>
<br>
One morning, in the middle of our unlawful freedoms--that is to say,<br>
when we were in bed together--he sighed, and told me he desired my<br>
leave to ask me one question, and that I would give him an answer to it<br>
with the same ingenious freedom and honesty that I had used to treat him<br>
with. I told him I would. Why, then, his question was, why I would not<br>
marry him, seeing I allowed him all the freedom of a husband. &quot;Or,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;my dear, since you have been so kind as to take me to your bed, why<br>
will you not make me your own, and take me for good and all, that we may<br>
enjoy ourselves without any reproach to one another?&quot;<br>
<br>
I told him, that as I confessed it was the only thing I could not comply<br>
with him in, so it was the only thing in all my actions that I could not<br>
give him a reason for; that it was true I had let him come to bed to me,<br>
which was supposed to be the greatest favour a woman could grant; but it<br>
was evident, and he might see it, that, as I was sensible of the<br>
obligation I was under to him for saving me from the worst circumstance<br>
it was possible for me to be brought to, I could deny him nothing; and<br>
if I had had any greater favour to yield him, I should have done it,<br>
that of matrimony only excepted, and he could not but see that I loved<br>
him to an extraordinary degree, in every part of my behaviour to him;<br>
but that as to marrying, which was giving up my liberty, it was what<br>
once he knew I had done, and he had seen how it had hurried me up and<br>
down in the world, and what it had exposed me to; that I had an aversion<br>
to it, and desired he would not insist upon it. He might easily see I<br>
had no aversion to him; and that, if I was with child by him, he should<br>
see a testimony of my kindness to the father, for that I would settle<br>
all I had in the world upon the child.<br>
<br>
He was mute a good while. At last says he, &quot;Come, my dear, you are the<br>
first woman in the world that ever lay with a man and then refused to<br>
marry him, and therefore there must be some other reason for your<br>
refusal; and I have therefore one other request, and that is, if I guess<br>
at the true reason, and remove the objection, will you then yield to<br>
me?&quot; I told him if he removed the objection I must needs comply, for I<br>
should certainly do everything that I had no objection against.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why then, my dear, it must be that either you are already engaged or<br>
married to some other man, or you are not willing to dispose of your<br>
money to me, and expect to advance yourself higher with your fortune.<br>
Now, if it be the first of these, my mouth will be stopped, and I have<br>
no more to say; but if it be the last, I am prepared effectually to<br>
remove the objection, and answer all you can say on that subject.&quot;<br>
<br>
I took him up short at the first of these, telling him he must have base<br>
thoughts of me indeed, to think that I could yield to him in such a<br>
manner as I had done, and continue it with so much freedom as he found I<br>
did, if I had a husband or were engaged to any other man; and that he<br>
might depend upon it that was not my case, nor any part of my case.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why then,&quot; said he, &quot;as to the other, I have an offer to make to you<br>
that shall take off all the objection, viz., that I will not touch one<br>
pistole of your estate more than shall be with your own voluntary<br>
consent, neither now or at any other time, but you shall settle it as<br>
you please for your life, and upon who you please after your death;&quot;<br>
that I should see he was able to maintain me without it, and that it was<br>
not for that that he followed me from Paris.<br>
<br>
I was indeed surprised at that part of his offer, and he might easily<br>
perceive it; it was not only what I did not expect, but it was what I<br>
knew not what answer to make to. He had, indeed, removed my principal<br>
objection--nay, all my objections, and it was not possible for me to<br>
give any answer; for, if upon so generous an offer I should agree with<br>
him, I then did as good as confess that it was upon the account of my<br>
money that I refused him; and that though I could give up my virtue and<br>
expose myself, yet I would not give up my money, which, though it was<br>
true, yet was really too gross for me to acknowledge, and I could not<br>
pretend to marry him upon that principle neither. Then as to having<br>
him, and make over all my estate out of his hands, so as not to give him<br>
the management of what I had, I thought it would be not only a little<br>
Gothic and inhuman, but would be always a foundation of unkindness<br>
between us, and render us suspected one to another; so that, upon the<br>
whole, I was obliged to give a new turn to it, and talk upon a kind of<br>
an elevated strain, which really was not in my thoughts, at first, at<br>
all; for I own, as above, the divesting myself of my estate and putting<br>
my money out of my hand was the sum of the matter that made me refuse to<br>
marry; but, I say, I gave it a new turn upon this occasion, as<br>
follows:--<br>
<br>
I told him I had, perhaps, different notions of matrimony from what the<br>
received custom had given us of it; that I thought a woman was a free<br>
agent as well as a man, and was born free, and, could she manage herself<br>
suitably, might enjoy that liberty to as much purpose as the men do;<br>
that the laws of matrimony were indeed otherwise, and mankind at this<br>
time acted quite upon other principles, and those such that a woman gave<br>
herself entirely away from herself, in marriage, and capitulated, only<br>
to be, at best, but an upper servant, and from the time she took the man<br>
she was no better or worse than the servant among the Israelites, who<br>
had his ears bored--that is, nailed to the door-post--who by that act<br>
gave himself up to be a servant during life; that the very nature of the<br>
marriage contract was, in short, nothing but giving up liberty, estate,<br>
authority, and everything to the man, and the woman was indeed a mere<br>
woman ever after--that is to say, a slave.<br>
<br>
He replied, that though in some respects it was as I had said, yet I<br>
ought to consider that, as an equivalent to this, the man had all the<br>
care of things devolved upon him; that the weight of business lay upon<br>
his shoulders, and as he had the trust, so he had the toil of life upon<br>
him; his was the labour, his the anxiety of living; that the woman had<br>
nothing to do but to eat the fat and drink the sweet; to sit still and<br>
look around her, be waited on and made much of, be served and loved and<br>
made easy, especially if the husband acted as became him; and that, in<br>
general, the labour of the man was appointed to make the woman live<br>
quiet and unconcerned in the world; that they had the name of subjection<br>
without the thing; and if in inferior families they had the drudgery of<br>
the house and care of the provisions upon them, yet they had indeed much<br>
the easier part; for, in general, the women had only the care of<br>
managing--that is, spending what their husbands get; and that a woman<br>
had the name of subjection, indeed, but that they generally commanded,<br>
not the men only, but all they had; managed all for themselves; and<br>
where the man did his duty, the woman's life was all ease and<br>
tranquillity, and that she had nothing to do but to be easy, and to make<br>
all that were about her both easy and merry.<br>
<br>
I returned, that while a woman was single, she was a masculine in her<br>
politic capacity; that she had then the full command of what she had,<br>
and the full direction of what she did; that she was a man in her<br>
separate capacity, to all intents and purposes that a man could be so to<br>
himself; that she was controlled by none, because accountable to none,<br>
and was in subjection to none. So I sung these two lines of Mr. ----'s:--<br>
<br>
 &quot;Oh! 'tis pleasant to be free,<br>
 The sweetest Miss is Liberty.&quot;<br>
<br>
I added, that whoever the woman was that had an estate, and would give<br>
it up to be the slave of a great man, that woman was a fool, and must be<br>
fit for nothing but a beggar; that it was my opinion a woman was as fit<br>
to govern and enjoy her own estate without a man as a man was without a<br>
woman; and that, if she had a mind to gratify herself as to sexes, she<br>
might entertain a man as a man does a mistress; that while she was thus<br>
single she was her own, and if she gave away that power she merited to<br>
be as miserable as it was possible that any creature could be.<br>
<br>
All he could say could not answer the force of this as to argument;<br>
only this, that the other way was the ordinary method that the world was<br>
guided by; that he had reason to expect I should be content with that<br>
which all the world was contented with; that he was of the opinion that<br>
a sincere affection between a man and his wife answered all the<br>
objections that I had made about the being a slave, a servant, and the<br>
like; and where there was a mutual love there could be no bondage, but<br>
that there was but one interest, one aim, one design, and all conspired<br>
to make both very happy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay,&quot; said I, &quot;that is the thing I complain of. The pretence of<br>
affection takes from a woman everything that can be called herself; she<br>
is to have no interest, no aim, no view; but all is the interest, aim,<br>
and view of the husband; she is to be the passive creature you spoke<br>
of,&quot; said I. &quot;She is to lead a life of perfect indolence, and living by<br>
faith, not in God, but in her husband, she sinks or swims, as he is<br>
either fool or wise man, unhappy or prosperous; and in the middle of<br>
what she thinks is her happiness and prosperity, she is engulfed in<br>
misery and beggary, which she had not the least notice, knowledge, or<br>
suspicion of. How often have I seen a woman living in all the splendour<br>
that a plentiful fortune ought to allow her, with her coaches and<br>
equipages, her family and rich furniture, her attendants and friends,<br>
her visitors and good company, all about her to-day; to-morrow<br>
surprised with a disaster, turned out of all by a commission of<br>
bankrupt, stripped to the clothes on her back; her jointure, suppose she<br>
had it, is sacrificed to the creditors so long as her husband lived, and<br>
she turned into the street, and left to live on the charity of her<br>
friends, if she has any, or follow the monarch, her husband, into the<br>
Mint, and live there on the wreck of his fortunes, till he is forced to<br>
run away from her even there; and then she sees her children starve,<br>
herself miserable, breaks her heart, and cries herself to death! This,&quot;<br>
says I, &quot;is the state of many a lady that has had &pound;10,000 to her<br>
portion.&quot;<br>
<br>
He did not know how feelingly I spoke this, and what extremities I had<br>
gone through of this kind; how near I was to the very last article<br>
above, viz., crying myself to death; and how I really starved for almost<br>
two years together.<br>
<br>
But he shook his head, and said, where had I lived? and what dreadful<br>
families had I lived among, that had frighted me into such terrible<br>
apprehensions of things? that these things indeed might happen where men<br>
run into hazardous things in trade, and, without prudence or due<br>
consideration, launched their fortunes in a degree beyond their<br>
strength, grasping at adventures beyond their stocks, and the like; but<br>
that, as he was stated in the world, if I would embark with him, he had<br>
a fortune equal with mine; that together we should have no occasion of<br>
engaging in business any more, but that in any part of the world where I<br>
had a mind to live, whether England, France, Holland, or where I would,<br>
we might settle, and live as happily as the world could make any one<br>
live; that if I desired the management of our estate, when put together,<br>
if I would not trust him with mine, he would trust me with his; that we<br>
would be upon one bottom, and I should steer. &quot;Ay,&quot; says I, &quot;you'll<br>
allow me to steer--that is, hold the helm--but you'll con the ship, as<br>
they call it; that is, as at sea, a boy serves to stand at the helm, but<br>
he that gives him the orders is pilot.&quot;<br>
<br>
He laughed at my simile. &quot;No,&quot; says he; &quot;you shall be pilot then; you<br>
shall con the ship.&quot; &quot;Ay,&quot; says I, &quot;as long as you please; but you can<br>
take the helm out of my hand when you please, and bid me go spin. It is<br>
not you,&quot; says I, &quot;that I suspect, but the laws of matrimony puts the<br>
power into your hands, bids you do it, commands you to command, and<br>
binds me, forsooth, to obey. You, that are now upon even terms with me,<br>
and I with you,&quot; says I, &quot;are the next hour set up upon the throne, and<br>
the humble wife placed at your footstool; all the rest, all that you<br>
call oneness of interest, mutual affection, and the like, is courtesy<br>
and kindness then, and a woman is indeed infinitely obliged where she<br>
meets with it, but can't help herself where it fails.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, he did not give it over yet, but came to the serious part, and<br>
there he thought he should be too many for me. He first hinted that<br>
marriage was decreed by Heaven; that it was the fixed state of life,<br>
which God had appointed for man's felicity, and for establishing a legal<br>
posterity; that there could be no legal claim of estates by inheritance<br>
but by children born in wedlock; that all the rest was sunk under<br>
scandal and illegitimacy; and very well he talked upon that subject<br>
indeed.<br>
<br>
But it would not do; I took him short there. &quot;Look you, sir,&quot; said I,<br>
&quot;you have an advantage of me there indeed, in my particular case, but it<br>
would not be generous to make use of it. I readily grant that it were<br>
better for me to have married you than to admit you to the liberty I<br>
have given you, but as I could not reconcile my judgment to marriage,<br>
for the reasons above, and had kindness enough for you, and obligation<br>
too much on me to resist you, I suffered your rudeness and gave up my<br>
virtue. But I have two things before me to heal up that breach of honour<br>
without that desperate one of marriage, and those are, repentance for<br>
what is past, and putting an end to it for time to come.&quot;<br>
<br>
He seemed to be concerned to think that I should take him in that<br>
manner. He assured me that I misunderstood him; that he had more manners<br>
as well as more kindness for me, and more justice than to reproach me<br>
with what he had been the aggressor in, and had surprised me into; that<br>
what he spoke referred to my words above, that the woman, if she thought<br>
fit, might entertain a man, as a man did a mistress; and that I seemed<br>
to mention that way of living as justifiable, and setting it as a lawful<br>
thing, and in the place of matrimony.<br>
<br>
Well, we strained some compliments upon those points, not worth<br>
repeating; and I added, I supposed when he got to bed to me he thought<br>
himself sure of me; and, indeed, in the ordinary course of things, after<br>
he had lain with me he ought to think so, but that, upon the same foot<br>
of argument which I had discoursed with him upon, it was just the<br>
contrary; and when a woman had been weak enough to yield up the last<br>
point before wedlock, it would be adding one weakness to another to take<br>
the man afterwards, to pin down the shame of it upon herself all the<br>
days of her life, and bind herself to live all her time with the only<br>
man that could upbraid her with it; that in yielding at first, she must<br>
be a fool, but to take the man is to be sure to be called fool; that to<br>
resist a man is to act with courage and vigour, and to cast off the<br>
reproach, which, in the course of things, drops out of knowledge and<br>
dies. The man goes one way and the woman another, as fate and the<br>
circumstances of living direct; and if they keep one another's counsel,<br>
the folly is heard no more of. &quot;But to take the man,&quot; says I, &quot;is the<br>
most preposterous thing in nature, and (saving your presence) is to<br>
befoul one's self, and live always in the smell of it. No, no,&quot; added I;<br>
&quot;after a man has lain with me as a mistress, he ought never to lie with<br>
me as a wife. That's not only preserving the crime in memory, but it is<br>
recording it in the family. If the woman marries the man afterwards, she<br>
bears the reproach of it to the last hour. If her husband is not a man<br>
of a hundred thousand, he some time or other upbraids her with it. If he<br>
has children, they fail not one way or other to hear of it. If the<br>
children are virtuous, they do their mother the justice to hate her for<br>
it; if they are wicked, they give her the mortification of doing the<br>
like, and giving her for the example. On the other hand, if the man and<br>
the woman part, there is an end of the crime and an end of the clamour;<br>
time wears out the memory of it, or a woman may remove but a few<br>
streets, and she soon outlives it, and hears no more of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was confounded at this discourse, and told me he could not say but I<br>
was right in the main. That as to that part relating to managing<br>
estates, it was arguing _&agrave; la cavalier_; it was in some sense right, if<br>
the women were able to carry it on so, but that in general the sex were<br>
not capable of it; their heads were not turned for it, and they had<br>
better choose a person capable and honest, that knew how to do them<br>
justice as women, as well as to love them; and that then the trouble was<br>
all taken off of their hands.<br>
<br>
I told him it was a dear way of purchasing their ease, for very often<br>
when the trouble was taken off of their hands, so was their money too;<br>
and that I thought it was far safer for the sex not to be afraid of the<br>
trouble, but to be really afraid of their money; that if nobody was<br>
trusted, nobody would be deceived, and the staff in their own hands was<br>
the best security in the world.<br>
<br>
He replied, that I had started a new thing in the world; that however I<br>
might support it by subtle reasoning, yet it was a way of arguing that<br>
was contrary to the general practice, and that he confessed he was much<br>
disappointed in it; that, had he known I would have made such a use of<br>
it, he would never have attempted what he did, which he had no wicked<br>
design in, resolving to make me reparation, and that he was very sorry<br>
he had been so unhappy; that he was very sure he should never upbraid me<br>
with it hereafter, and had so good an opinion of me as to believe I did<br>
not suspect him; but seeing I was positive in refusing him,<br>
notwithstanding what had passed, he had nothing to do but secure me from<br>
reproach by going back again to Paris, that so, according to my own way<br>
of arguing, it might die out of memory, and I might never meet with it<br>
again to my disadvantage.<br>
<br>
I was not pleased with this part at all, for I had no mind to let him go<br>
neither, and yet I had no mind to give him such hold of me as he would<br>
have had; and thus I was in a kind of suspense, irresolute, and doubtful<br>
what course to take.<br>
<br>
I was in the house with him, as I have observed, and I saw evidently<br>
that he was preparing to go back to Paris; and particularly I found he<br>
was remitting money to Paris, which was, as I understood afterwards, to<br>
pay for some wines which he had given order to have bought for him at<br>
Troyes, in Champagne, and I knew not what course to take; and, besides<br>
that, I was very loth to part with him. I found also that I was with<br>
child by him, which was what I had not yet told him of, and sometimes I<br>
thought not to tell him of it at all; but I was in a strange place, and<br>
had no acquaintance, though I had a great deal of substance, which<br>
indeed, having no friends there, was the more dangerous to me.<br>
<br>
This obliged me to take him one morning when I saw him, as I thought, a<br>
little anxious about his going, and irresolute. Says I to him, &quot;I fancy<br>
you can hardly find in your heart to leave me now.&quot; &quot;The more unkind is<br>
it in you,&quot; said he, &quot;severely unkind, to refuse a man that knows not<br>
how to part with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am so far from being unkind to you,&quot; said I, &quot;that I will go over all<br>
the world with you if you desire me to, except to Paris, where you know<br>
I can't go.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a pity so much love,&quot; said he, &quot;on both sides should ever<br>
separate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, then,&quot; said I, &quot;do you go away from me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Because,&quot; said he, &quot;you won't take me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But if I won't take you,&quot; said I, &quot;you may take me anywhere but to<br>
Paris.&quot;<br>
<br>
He was very loth to go anywhere, he said, without me, but he must go to<br>
Paris or the East Indies.<br>
<br>
I told him I did not use to court, but I durst venture myself to the<br>
East Indies with him, if there was a necessity of his going.<br>
<br>
He told me, God be thanked he was in no necessity of going anywhere, but<br>
that he had a tempting invitation to go to the Indies.<br>
<br>
I answered, I would say nothing to that, but that I desired he would go<br>
anywhere but to Paris, because there he knew I must not go.<br>
<br>
He said he had no remedy but to go where I could not go, for he could<br>
not bear to see me if he must not have me.<br>
<br>
I told him that was the unkindest thing he could say of me, and that I<br>
ought to take it very ill, seeing I knew how very well to oblige him to<br>
stay, without yielding to what he knew I could not yield to.<br>
<br>
This amazed him, and he told me I was pleased to be mysterious, but that<br>
he was sure it was in nobody's power to hinder him going, if he<br>
resolved upon it, except me, who had influence enough upon him to make<br>
him do anything.<br>
<br>
Yes, I told him, I could hinder him, because I knew he could no more do<br>
an unkind thing by me than he could do an unjust one; and to put him out<br>
of his pain, I told him I was with child.<br>
<br>
He came to me, and taking me in his arms and kissing me a thousand times<br>
almost, said, why would I be so unkind not to tell him that before?<br>
<br>
I told him 'twas hard, that to have him stay, I should be forced to do<br>
as criminals do to avoid the gallows, plead my belly; and that I thought<br>
I had given him testimonies enough of an affection equal to that of a<br>
wife, if I had not only lain with him, been with child by him, shown<br>
myself unwilling to part with him, but offered to go to the East Indies<br>
with him; and except one thing that I could not grant, what could he ask<br>
more?<br>
<br>
He stood mute a good while, but afterwards told me he had a great deal<br>
more to say if I could assure him that I would not take ill whatever<br>
freedom he might use with me in his discourse.<br>
<br>
I told him he might use any freedom in words with me; for a woman who<br>
had given leave to such other freedoms as I had done had left herself no<br>
room to take anything ill, let it be what it would.<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, then,&quot; he said, &quot;I hope you believe, madam, I was born a<br>
Christian, and that I have some sense of sacred things upon my mind.<br>
When I first broke in upon my own virtue and assaulted yours; when I<br>
surprised and, as it were, forced you to that which neither you intended<br>
or I designed but a few hours before, it was upon a presumption that you<br>
would certainly marry me, if once I could go that length with you, and<br>
it was with an honest resolution to make you my wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;But I have been surprised with such a denial that no woman in such<br>
circumstances ever gave to a man; for certainly it was never known that<br>
any woman refused to marry a man that had first lain with her, much less<br>
a man that had gotten her with child. But you go upon different notions<br>
from all the world, and though you reason upon it so strongly that a man<br>
knows hardly what to answer, yet I must own there is something in it<br>
shocking to nature, and something very unkind to yourself. But, above<br>
all, it is unkind to the child that is yet unborn, who, if we marry,<br>
will come into the world with advantage enough, but if not, is ruined<br>
before it is born; must bear the eternal reproach of what it is not<br>
guilty of; must be branded from its cradle with a mark of infamy, be<br>
loaded with the crimes and follies of its parents, and suffer for sins<br>
that it never committed. This I take to be very hard, and, indeed, cruel<br>
to the poor infant not yet born, who you cannot think of with any<br>
patience, if you have the common affection of a mother, and not do that<br>
for it which should at once place it on a level with the rest of the<br>
world, and not leave it to curse its parents for what also we ought to<br>
be ashamed of. I cannot, therefore,&quot; says he, &quot;but beg and entreat you,<br>
as you are a Christian and a mother, not to let the innocent lamb you go<br>
with be ruined before it is born, and leave it to curse and reproach us<br>
hereafter for what may be so easily avoided.<br>
<br>
&quot;Then, dear madam,&quot; said he, with a world of tenderness (and I thought I<br>
saw tears in his eyes), &quot;allow me to repeat it, that I am a Christian,<br>
and consequently I do not allow what I have rashly, and without due<br>
consideration, done; I say, I do not approve of it as lawful, and<br>
therefore, though I did, with the view I have mentioned, one<br>
unjustifiable action, I cannot say that I could satisfy myself to live<br>
in a continual practice of what in judgment we must both condemn; and<br>
though I love you above all the women in the world, and have done enough<br>
to convince you of it by resolving to marry you after what has passed<br>
between us, and by offering to quit all pretensions to any part of your<br>
estate, so that I should, as it were, take a wife after I had lain with<br>
her, and without a farthing portion, which, as my circumstances are, I<br>
need not do; I say, notwithstanding my affection to you, which is<br>
inexpressible, yet I cannot give up soul as well as body, the interest<br>
of this world and the hopes of another; and you cannot call this my<br>
disrespect to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
If ever any man in the world was truly valuable for the strictest<br>
honesty of intention, this was the man; and if ever woman in her senses<br>
rejected a man of merit on so trivial and frivolous a pretence, I was<br>
the woman; but surely it was the most preposterous thing that ever woman<br>
did.<br>
<br>
He would have taken me as a wife, but would not entertain me as a whore.<br>
Was ever woman angry with any gentleman on that head? And was ever woman<br>
so stupid to choose to be a whore, where she might have been an honest<br>
wife? But infatuations are next to being possessed of the devil. I was<br>
inflexible, and pretended to argue upon the point of a woman's liberty<br>
as before, but he took me short, and with more warmth than he had yet<br>
used with me, though with the utmost respect, replied, &quot;Dear madam, you<br>
argue for liberty, at the same time that you restrain yourself from that<br>
liberty which God and nature has directed you to take, and, to supply<br>
the deficiency, propose a vicious liberty, which is neither honourable<br>
or religious. Will you propose liberty at the expense of modesty?&quot;<br>
<br>
I returned, that he mistook me; I did not propose it; I only said that<br>
those that could not be content without concerning the sexes in that<br>
affair might do so indeed; might entertain a man as men do a mistress,<br>
if they thought fit, but he did not hear me say I would do so; and<br>
though, by what had passed, he might well censure me in that part, yet<br>
he should find, for the future, that I should freely converse with him<br>
without any inclination that way.<br>
<br>
He told me he could not promise that for himself, and thought he ought<br>
not to trust himself with the opportunity, for that, as he had failed<br>
already, he was loth to lead himself into the temptation of offending<br>
again, and that this was the true reason of his resolving to go back to<br>
Paris; not that he could willingly leave me, and would be very far from<br>
wanting my invitation; but if he could not stay upon terms that became<br>
him, either as an honest man or a Christian, what could he do? And he<br>
hoped, he said, I could not blame him that he was unwilling anything<br>
that was to call him father should upbraid him with leaving him in the<br>
world to be called bastard; adding that he was astonished to think how I<br>
could satisfy myself to be so cruel to an innocent infant not yet born;<br>
professed he could neither bear the thoughts of it, much less bear to<br>
see it, and hoped I would not take it ill that he could not stay to see<br>
me delivered, for that very reason.<br>
<br>
I saw he spoke this with a disturbed mind, and that it was with some<br>
difficulty that he restrained his passion, so I declined any farther<br>
discourse upon it; only said I hoped he would consider of it. &quot;Oh,<br>
madam!&quot; says he, &quot;do not bid me consider; 'tis for you to consider;&quot; and<br>
with that he went out of the room, in a strange kind of confusion, as<br>
was easy to be seen in his countenance.<br>
<br>
If I had not been one of the foolishest as well as wickedest creatures<br>
upon earth, I could never have acted thus. I had one of the honestest,<br>
completest gentlemen upon earth at my hand. He had in one sense saved my<br>
life, but he had saved that life from ruin in a most remarkable manner.<br>
He loved me even to distraction, and had come from Paris to Rotterdam on<br>
purpose to seek me. He had offered me marriage even after I was with<br>
child by him, and had offered to quit all his pretensions to my estate,<br>
and give it up to my own management, having a plentiful estate of his<br>
own. Here I might have settled myself out of the reach even of disaster<br>
itself; his estate and mine would have purchased even then above two<br>
thousand pounds a year, and I might have lived like a queen--nay, far<br>
more happy than a queen; and, which was above all, I had now an<br>
opportunity to have quitted a life of crime and debauchery, which I had<br>
been given up to for several years, and to have sat down quiet in plenty<br>
and honour, and to have set myself apart to the great work which I have<br>
since seen so much necessity of and occasion for--I mean that of<br>
repentance.<br>
<br>
But my measure of wickedness was not yet full. I continued obstinate<br>
against matrimony, and yet I could not bear the thoughts of his going<br>
away neither. As to the child, I was not very anxious about it. I told<br>
him I would promise him it should never come to him to upbraid him with<br>
its being illegitimate; that if it was a boy, I would breed it up like<br>
the son of a gentleman, and use it well for his sake; and after a little<br>
more such talk as this, and seeing him resolved to go, I retired, but<br>
could not help letting him see the tears run down my cheeks. He came to<br>
me and kissed me, entreated me, conjured me by the kindness he had shown<br>
me in my distress, by the justice he had done me in my bills and money<br>
affairs, by the respect which made him refuse a thousand pistoles from<br>
me for his expenses with that traitor the Jew, by the pledge of our<br>
misfortunes--so he called it--which I carried with me, and by all that<br>
the sincerest affection could propose to do, that I would not drive him<br>
away.<br>
<br>
But it would not do. I was stupid and senseless, deaf to all his<br>
importunities, and continued so to the last. So we parted, only desiring<br>
me to promise that I would write him word when I was delivered, and how<br>
he might give me an answer; and this I engaged my word I would do. And<br>
upon his desiring to be informed which way I intended to dispose of<br>
myself, I told him I resolved to go directly to England, and to London,<br>
where I proposed to lie in; but since he resolved to leave me, I told<br>
him I supposed it would be of no consequence to him what became of me.<br>
<br>
He lay in his lodgings that night, but went away early in the morning,<br>
leaving me a letter in which he repeated all he had said, recommended<br>
the care of the child, and desired of me that as he had remitted to me<br>
the offer of a thousand pistoles which I would have given him for the<br>
recompense of his charges and trouble with the Jew, and had given it me<br>
back, so he desired I would allow him to oblige me to set apart that<br>
thousand pistoles, with its improvement, for the child, and for its<br>
education; earnestly pressing me to secure that little portion for the<br>
abandoned orphan when I should think fit, as he was sure I would, to<br>
throw away the rest upon something as worthless as my sincere friend at<br>
Paris. He concluded with moving me to reflect, with the same regret as<br>
he did, on our follies we had committed together; asked me forgiveness<br>
for being the aggressor in the fact, and forgave me everything, he said,<br>
but the cruelty of refusing him, which he owned he could not forgive me<br>
so heartily as he should do, because he was satisfied it was an injury<br>
to myself, would be an introduction to my ruin, and that I would<br>
seriously repent of it. He foretold some fatal things which, he said, he<br>
was well assured I should fall into, and that at last I would be ruined<br>
by a bad husband; bid me be the more wary, that I might render him a<br>
false prophet; but to remember that, if ever I came into distress, I had<br>
a fast friend at Paris, who would not upbraid me with the unkind things<br>
past, but would be always ready to return me good for evil.<br>
<br>
This letter stunned me. I could not think it possible for any one that<br>
had not dealt with the devil to write such a letter, for he spoke of<br>
some particular things which afterwards were to befall me with such an<br>
assurance that it frighted me beforehand; and when those things did come<br>
to pass, I was persuaded he had some more than human knowledge. In a<br>
word, his advices to me to repent were very affectionate, his warnings<br>
of evil to happen to me were very kind, and his promises of assistance,<br>
if I wanted him, were so generous that I have seldom seen the like; and<br>
though I did not at first set much by that part because I looked upon<br>
them as what might not happen, and as what was improbable to happen at<br>
that time, yet all the rest of his letter was so moving that it left me<br>
very melancholy, and I cried four-and-twenty hours after, almost without<br>
ceasing, about it; and yet even all this while, whatever it was that<br>
bewitched me, I had not one serious wish that I had taken him. I wished<br>
heartily, indeed, that I could have kept him with me, but I had a mortal<br>
aversion to marrying him, or indeed anybody else, but formed a thousand<br>
wild notions in my head that I was yet gay enough, and young and<br>
handsome enough, to please a man of quality, and that I would try my<br>
fortune at London, come of it what would.<br>
<br>
Thus blinded by my own vanity, I threw away the only opportunity I then<br>
had to have effectually settled my fortunes, and secured them for this<br>
world; and I am a memorial to all that shall read my story, a standing<br>
monument of the madness and distraction which pride and infatuations<br>
from hell run us into, how ill our passions guide us, and how<br>
dangerously we act when we follow the dictates of an ambitious mind.<br>
<br>
I was rich, beautiful, and agreeable, and not yet old. I had known<br>
something of the influence I had had upon the fancies of men even of the<br>
highest rank. I never forgot that the Prince de ---- had said, with an<br>
ecstasy, that I was the finest woman in France. I knew I could make a<br>
figure at London, and how well I could grace that figure. I was not at a<br>
loss how to behave, and having already been adored by princes, I thought<br>
of nothing less than of being mistress to the king himself. But I go<br>
back to my immediate circumstances at that time.<br>
<br>
I got over the absence of my honest merchant but slowly at first. It was<br>
with infinite regret that I let him go at all; and when I read the<br>
letter he left I was quite confounded. As soon as he was out of call<br>
and irrecoverable I would have given half I had in the world for him<br>
back again; my notion of things changed in an instant, and I called<br>
myself a thousand fools for casting myself upon a life of scandal and<br>
hazard, when, after the shipwreck of virtue, honour, and principle, and<br>
sailing at the utmost risk in the stormy seas of crime and abominable<br>
levity, I had a safe harbour presented, and no heart to cast anchor in<br>
it.<br>
<br>
His predictions terrified me; his promises of kindness if I came to<br>
distress melted me into tears, but frighted me with the apprehensions of<br>
ever coming into such distress, and filled my head with a thousand<br>
anxieties and thoughts how it should be possible for me, who had now<br>
such a fortune, to sink again into misery.<br>
<br>
Then the dreadful scene of my life, when I was left with my five<br>
children, &amp;c., as I have related, represented itself again to me, and I<br>
sat considering what measures I might take to bring myself to such a<br>
state of desolation again, and how I should act to avoid it.<br>
<br>
But these things wore off gradually. As to my friend the merchant, he<br>
was gone, and gone irrecoverably, for I durst not follow him to Paris,<br>
for the reasons mentioned above. Again, I was afraid to write to him to<br>
return, lest he should have refused, as I verily believed he would; so<br>
I sat and cried intolerably for some days--nay, I may say for some<br>
weeks; but, I say, it wore off gradually, and as I had a pretty deal of<br>
business for managing my effects, the hurry of that particular part<br>
served to divert my thoughts, and in part to wear out the impressions<br>
which had been made upon my mind.<br>
<br>
I had sold my jewels, all but the diamond ring which my gentleman the<br>
jeweller used to wear, and this, at proper times, I wore myself; as also<br>
the diamond necklace which the prince had given me, and a pair of<br>
extraordinary earrings worth about 600 pistoles; the other, which was a<br>
fine casket, he left with me at his going to Versailles, and a small<br>
case with some rubies and emeralds, &amp;c. I say I sold them at the Hague<br>
for 7600 pistoles. I had received all the bills which the merchant had<br>
helped me to at Paris, and with the money I brought with me, they made<br>
up 13,900 pistoles more; so that I had in ready money, and in account in<br>
the bank at Amsterdam, above one-and-twenty thousand pistoles, besides<br>
jewels; and how to get this treasure to England was my next care.<br>
<br>
The business I had had now with a great many people for receiving such<br>
large sums and selling jewels of such considerable value gave me<br>
opportunity to know and converse with several of the best merchants of<br>
the place, so that I wanted no direction now how to get my money<br>
remitted to England. Applying, therefore, to several merchants, that I<br>
might neither risk it all on the credit of one merchant, nor suffer any<br>
single man to know the quantity of money I had; I say, applying myself<br>
to several merchants, I got bills of exchange payable in London for all<br>
my money. The first bills I took with me; the second bills I left in<br>
trust (in case of any disaster at sea) in the hands of the first<br>
merchant, him to whom I was recommended by my friend from Paris.<br>
<br>
Having thus spent nine months in Holland, refused the best offer ever<br>
woman in my circumstances had, parted unkindly, and indeed barbarously,<br>
with the best friend and honestest man in the world, got all my money in<br>
my pocket, and a bastard in my belly, I took shipping at the Brill in<br>
the packet-boat, and arrived safe at Harwich, where my woman Amy was<br>
come by my direction to meet me.<br>
<br>
I would willingly have given ten thousand pounds of my money to have<br>
been rid of the burthen I had in my belly, as above; but it could not<br>
be, so I was obliged to bear with that part, and get rid of it by the<br>
ordinary method of patience and a hard travail.<br>
<br>
I was above the contemptible usage that women in my circumstances<br>
oftentimes meet with. I had considered all that beforehand; and having<br>
sent Amy beforehand, and remitted her money to do it, she had taken me<br>
a very handsome house in ---- Street, near Charing Cross; had hired me<br>
two maids and a footman, who she had put in a good livery; and having<br>
hired a glass coach and four horses, she came with them and the<br>
man-servant to Harwich to meet me, and had been there near a week before<br>
I came, so I had nothing to do but to go away to London to my own house,<br>
where I arrived in very good health, and where I passed for a French<br>
lady, by the title of ----.<br>
<br>
My first business was to get all my bills accepted, which, to cut the<br>
story short, was all both accepted and currently paid; and I then<br>
resolved to take me a country lodging somewhere near the town, to be<br>
incognito, till I was brought to bed; which, appearing in such a figure<br>
and having such an equipage, I easily managed without anybody's offering<br>
the usual insults of parish inquiries. I did not appear in my new house<br>
for some time, and afterwards I thought fit, for particular reasons, to<br>
quit that house, and not to come to it at all, but take handsome large<br>
apartments in the Pall Mall, in a house out of which was a private door<br>
into the king's garden, by the permission of the chief gardener, who had<br>
lived in the house.<br>
<br>
I had now all my effects secured; but my money being my great concern at<br>
that time, I found it a difficulty how to dispose of it so as to bring<br>
me in an annual interest. However, in some time I got a substantial<br>
safe mortgage for &pound;14,000 by the assistance of the famous Sir Robert<br>
Clayton, for which I had an estate of &pound;1800 a year bound to me, and had<br>
&pound;700 per annum interest for it.<br>
<br>
This, with some other securities, made me a very handsome estate of<br>
above a thousand pounds a year; enough, one would think, to keep any<br>
woman in England from being a whore.<br>
<br>
I lay in at ----, about four miles from London, and brought a fine boy<br>
into the world, and, according to my promise, sent an account of it to<br>
my friend at Paris, the father of it; and in the letter told him how<br>
sorry I was for his going away, and did as good as intimate that, if he<br>
would come once more to see me, I should use him better than I had done.<br>
He gave me a very kind and obliging answer, but took not the least<br>
notice of what I had said of his coming over, so I found my interest<br>
lost there for ever. He gave me joy of the child, and hinted that he<br>
hoped I would make good what he had begged for the poor infant as I had<br>
promised, and I sent him word again that I would fulfil his order to a<br>
tittle; and such a fool and so weak I was in this last letter,<br>
notwithstanding what I have said of his not taking notice of my<br>
invitation, as to ask his pardon almost for the usage I gave him at<br>
Rotterdam, and stooped so low as to expostulate with him for not taking<br>
notice of my inviting him to come to me again, as I had done; and,<br>
which was still more, went so far as to make a second sort of an offer<br>
to him, telling him, almost in plain words, that if he would come over<br>
now I would have him; but he never gave me the least reply to it at all,<br>
which was as absolute a denial to me as he was ever able to give; so I<br>
sat down, I cannot say contented, but vexed heartily that I had made the<br>
offer at all, for he had, as I may say, his full revenge of me in<br>
scorning to answer, and to let me twice ask that of him which he with so<br>
much importunity begged of me before.<br>
<br>
I was now up again, and soon came to my City lodging in the Pall Mall,<br>
and here I began to make a figure suitable to my estate, which was very<br>
great; and I shall give you an account of my equipage in a few words,<br>
and of myself too.<br>
<br>
I paid &pound;60 a year for my new apartments, for I took them by the year;<br>
but then they were handsome lodgings indeed, and very richly furnished.<br>
I kept my own servants to clean and look after them, found my own<br>
kitchen ware and firing. My equipage was handsome, but not very great; I<br>
had a coach, a coachman, a footman, my woman Amy, who I now dressed like<br>
a gentlewoman and made her my companion, and three maids; and thus I<br>
lived for a time. I dressed to the height of every mode, went extremely<br>
rich in clothes, and as for jewels, I wanted none. I gave a very good<br>
livery, laced with silver, and as rich as anybody below the nobility<br>
could be seen with; and thus I appeared, leaving the world to guess who<br>
or what I was, without offering to put myself forward.<br>
<br>
I walked sometimes in the Mall with my woman Amy, but I kept no company<br>
and made no acquaintances, only made as gay a show as I was able to do,<br>
and that upon all occasions. I found, however, the world was not<br>
altogether so unconcerned about me as I seemed to be about them; and<br>
first I understood that the neighbours began to be mighty inquisitive<br>
about me, as who I was, and what my circumstances were.<br>
<br>
Amy was the only person that could answer their curiosity or give any<br>
account of me; and she, a tattling woman and a true gossip, took care to<br>
do that with all the art that she was mistress of. She let them know<br>
that I was the widow of a person of quality in France, that I was very<br>
rich, that I came over hither to look after an estate that fell to me by<br>
some of my relations who died here, that I was worth &pound;40,000 all in my<br>
own hands, and the like.<br>
<br>
This was all wrong in Amy, and in me too, though we did not see it at<br>
first, for this recommended me indeed to those sort of gentlemen they<br>
call fortune-hunters, and who always besieged ladies, as they called<br>
it--on purpose to take them prisoners, as I called it--that is to say,<br>
to marry the women and have the spending of their money. But if I was<br>
wrong in refusing the honourable proposals of the Dutch merchant, who<br>
offered me the disposal of my whole estate, and had as much of his own<br>
to maintain me with, I was right now in refusing those offers which came<br>
generally from gentlemen of good families and good estates, but who,<br>
living to the extent of them, were always needy and necessitous, and<br>
wanted a sum of money to make themselves easy, as they call it--that is<br>
to say, to pay off encumbrances, sisters' portions, and the like; and<br>
then the woman is prisoner for life, and may live as they give her<br>
leave. This life I had seen into clearly enough, and therefore I was not<br>
to be catched that way. However, as I said, the reputation of my money<br>
brought several of those sort of gentry about me, and they found means,<br>
by one stratagem or other, to get access to my ladyship; but, in short,<br>
I answered them well enough, that I lived single and was happy; that as<br>
I had no occasion to change my condition for an estate, so I did not see<br>
that by the best offer that any of them could make me I could mend my<br>
fortune; that I might be honoured with titles indeed, and in time rank<br>
on public occasions with the peeresses (I mention that because one that<br>
offered at me was the eldest son of a peer), but that I was as well<br>
without the title as long as I had the estate, and while I had &pound;2000 a<br>
year of my own I was happier than I could be in being prisoner of state<br>
to a nobleman, for I took the ladies of that rank to be little better.<br>
<br>
As I have mentioned Sir Robert Clayton, with whom I had the good fortune<br>
to become acquainted, on account of the mortgage which he helped me to,<br>
it is necessary to take notice that I had much advantage in my ordinary<br>
affairs by his advice, and therefore I called it my good fortune; for as<br>
he paid me so considerable an annual income as &pound;700 a year, so I am to<br>
acknowledge myself much a debtor, not only to the justice of his<br>
dealings with me, but to the prudence and conduct which he guided me to,<br>
by his advice, for the management of my estate. And as he found I was<br>
not inclined to marry, he frequently took occasion to hint how soon I<br>
might raise my fortune to a prodigious height if I would but order my<br>
family economy so far within my revenue as to lay up every year<br>
something to add to the capital.<br>
<br>
I was convinced of the truth of what he said, and agreed to the<br>
advantages of it. You are to take it as you go that Sir Robert supposed<br>
by my own discourse, and especially by my woman Amy, that I had &pound;2000 a<br>
year income. He judged, as he said, by my way of living that I could not<br>
spend above one thousand, and so, he added, I might prudently lay by<br>
&pound;1000 every year to add to the capital; and by adding every year the<br>
additional interest or income of the money to the capital, he proved to<br>
me that in ten years I should double the &pound;1000 per annum that I laid by.<br>
And he drew me out a table, as he called it, of the increase, for me to<br>
judge by; and by which, he said, if the gentlemen of England would but<br>
act so, every family of them would increase their fortunes to a great<br>
degree, just as merchants do by trade; whereas now, says Sir Robert, by<br>
the humour of living up to the extent of their fortunes, and rather<br>
beyond, the gentlemen, says he, ay, and the nobility too, are almost all<br>
of them borrowers, and all in necessitous circumstances.<br>
<br>
As Sir Robert frequently visited me, and was (if I may say so from his<br>
own mouth) very well pleased with my way of conversing with him, for he<br>
knew nothing, not so much as guessed at what I had been; I say, as he<br>
came often to see me, so he always entertained me with this scheme of<br>
frugality; and one time he brought another paper, wherein he showed me,<br>
much to the same purpose as the former, to what degree I should increase<br>
my estate if I would come into his method of contracting my expenses;<br>
and by this scheme of his, it appeared that, laying up a thousand pounds<br>
a year, and every year adding the interest to it, I should in twelve<br>
years' time have in bank one-and-twenty thousand and fifty-eight<br>
pounds, after which I might lay up two thousand pounds a year.<br>
<br>
I objected that I was a young woman, that I had been used to live<br>
plentifully, and with a good appearance, and that I knew not how to be a<br>
miser.<br>
<br>
He told me that if I thought I had enough it was well, but that if I<br>
desired to have more, this was the way; that in another twelve years I<br>
should be too rich, so that I should not know what to do with it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, sir,&quot; says I, &quot;you are contriving how to make me a rich old woman,<br>
but that won't answer my end; I had rather have &pound;20,000 now than &pound;60,000<br>
when I am fifty years old.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Then, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;I suppose your honour has no children?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;None, Sir Robert,&quot; said I, &quot;but what are provided for.&quot; So I left him<br>
in the dark as much as I found him. However, I considered his scheme<br>
very well, though I said no more to him at that time, and I resolved,<br>
though I would make a very good figure, I say I resolved to abate a<br>
little of my expense, and draw in, live closer, and save something, if<br>
not so much as he proposed to me. It was near the end of the year that<br>
Sir Robert made this proposal to me, and when the year was up I went to<br>
his house in the City, and there I told him I came to thank him for his<br>
scheme of frugality; that I had been studying much upon it, and though I<br>
had not been able to mortify myself so much as to lay up a thousand<br>
pounds a year, yet, as I had not come to him for my interest<br>
half-yearly, as was usual, I was now come to let him know that I had<br>
resolved to lay up that seven hundred pounds a year, and never use a<br>
penny of it, desiring him to help me to put it out to advantage.<br>
<br>
Sir Robert, a man thoroughly versed in arts of improving money, but<br>
thoroughly honest, said to me, &quot;Madam, I am glad you approve of the<br>
method that I proposed to you; but you have begun wrong; you should have<br>
come for your interest at the half-year, and then you had had the money<br>
to put out. Now you have lost half a year's interest of &pound;350, which is<br>
&pound;9; for I had but 5 per cent, on the mortgage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well, sir,&quot; says I, &quot;can you put this out for me now?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let it lie, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;till the next year, and then I'll put out<br>
your &pound;1400 together, and in the meantime I'll pay you interest for the<br>
&pound;700.&quot; So he gave me his bill for the money, which he told me should be<br>
no less than &pound;6 per cent. Sir Robert Clayton's bill was what nobody<br>
would refuse, so I thanked him and let it lie; and next year I did the<br>
same, and the third year Sir Robert got me a good mortgage for &pound;2200 at<br>
&pound;6 per cent interest. So I had &pound;132 a year added to my income, which was<br>
a very satisfying article.<br>
<br>
But I return to my history. As I have said, I found that my measures<br>
were all wrong; the posture I set up in exposed me to innumerable<br>
visitors of the kind I have mentioned above. I was cried up for a vast<br>
fortune, and one that Sir Robert Clayton managed for; and Sir Robert<br>
Clayton was courted for me as much as I was for myself. But I had given<br>
Sir Robert his cue. I had told him my opinion of matrimony, in just the<br>
same terms as I had done my merchant, and he came into it presently. He<br>
owned that my observation was just, and that if I valued my liberty, as<br>
I knew my fortune, and that it was in my own hands, I was to blame if I<br>
gave it away to any one.<br>
<br>
But Sir Robert knew nothing of my design, that I aimed at being a kept<br>
mistress, and to have a handsome maintenance; and that I was still for<br>
getting money, and laying it up too, as much as he could desire me, only<br>
by a worse way.<br>
<br>
However, Sir Robert came seriously to me one day, and told me he had an<br>
offer of matrimony to make to me that was beyond all that he had heard<br>
had offered themselves, and this was a merchant. Sir Robert and I agreed<br>
exactly in our notions of a merchant. Sir Robert said, and I found it to<br>
be true, that a true-bred merchant is the best gentleman in the nation;<br>
that in knowledge, in manners, in judgment of things, the merchant<br>
outdid many of the nobility; that having once mastered the world, and<br>
being above the demand of business, though no real estate, they were<br>
then superior to most gentlemen, even in estate; that a merchant in<br>
flush business and a capital stock is able to spend more money than a<br>
gentleman of &pound;5000 a year estate; that while a merchant spent, he only<br>
spent what he got, and not that, and that he laid up great sums every<br>
year; that an estate is a pond, but that a trade was a spring; that if<br>
the first is once mortgaged, it seldom gets clear, but embarrassed the<br>
person for ever; but the merchant had his estate continually flowing;<br>
and upon this he named me merchants who lived in more real splendour and<br>
spent more money than most of the noblemen in England could singly<br>
expend, and that they still grew immensely rich.<br>
<br>
He went on to tell me that even the tradesmen in London, speaking of the<br>
better sort of trades, could spend more money in their families, and yet<br>
give better fortunes to their children, than, generally speaking, the<br>
gentry of England from &pound;1000 a year downward could do, and yet grow rich<br>
too.<br>
<br>
The upshot of all this was to recommend to me rather the bestowing my<br>
fortune upon some eminent merchant, who lived already in the first<br>
figure of a merchant, and who, not being in want or scarcity of money,<br>
but having a flourishing business and a flowing cash, would at the first<br>
word settle all my fortune on myself and children, and maintain me like<br>
a queen.<br>
<br>
This was certainly right, and had I taken his advice, I had been really<br>
happy; but my heart was bent upon an independency of fortune, and I told<br>
him I knew no state of matrimony but what was at best a state of<br>
inferiority, if not of bondage; that I had no notion of it; that I lived<br>
a life of absolute liberty now, was free as I was born, and having a<br>
plentiful fortune, I did not understand what coherence the words &quot;honour<br>
and obey&quot; had with the liberty of a free woman; that I knew no reason<br>
the men had to engross the whole liberty of the race, and make the<br>
woman, notwithstanding any disparity of fortune, be subject to the laws<br>
of marriage, of their own making; that it was my misfortune to be a<br>
woman, but I was resolved it should not be made worse by the sex; and,<br>
seeing liberty seemed to be the men's property, I would be a man-woman,<br>
for, as I was born free, I would die so.<br>
<br>
Sir Robert smiled, and told me I talked a kind of Amazonian language;<br>
that he found few women of my mind, or that, if they were, they wanted<br>
resolution to go on with it; that, notwithstanding all my notions, which<br>
he could not but say had once some weight in them, yet he understood I<br>
had broke in upon them, and had been married. I answered, I had so; but<br>
he did not hear me say that I had any encouragement from what was past<br>
to make a second venture; that I was got well out of the toil, and if I<br>
came in again I should have nobody to blame but myself.<br>
<br>
Sir Robert laughed heartily at me, but gave over offering any more<br>
arguments, only told me he had pointed me out for some of the best<br>
merchants in London, but since I forbade him he would give me no<br>
disturbance of that kind. He applauded my way of managing my money, and<br>
told me I should soon be monstrous rich; but he neither knew or<br>
mistrusted that, with all this wealth, I was yet a whore, and was not<br>
averse to adding to my estate at the farther expense of my virtue.<br>
<br>
But to go on with my story as to my way of living. I found, as above,<br>
that my living as I did would not answer; that it only brought the<br>
fortune-hunters and bites about me, as I have said before, to make a<br>
prey of me and my money; and, in short, I was harassed with lovers,<br>
beaux, and fops of quality, in abundance, but it would not do. I aimed<br>
at other things, and was possessed with so vain an opinion of my own<br>
beauty, that nothing less than the king himself was in my eye. And this<br>
vanity was raised by some words let fall by a person I conversed with,<br>
who was, perhaps, likely enough to have brought such a thing to pass,<br>
had it been sooner; but that game began to be pretty well over at<br>
court. However, the having mentioned such a thing, it seems a little<br>
too publicly, it brought abundance of people about me, upon a wicked<br>
account too.<br>
<br>
And now I began to act in a new sphere. The court was exceedingly gay<br>
and fine, though fuller of men than of women, the queen not affecting to<br>
be very much in public. On the other hand, it is no slander upon the<br>
courtiers to say, they were as wicked as anybody in reason could desire<br>
them. The king had several mistresses, who were prodigious fine, and<br>
there was a glorious show on that side indeed. If the sovereign gave<br>
himself a loose, it could not be expected the rest of the court should<br>
be all saints; so far was it from that, though I would not make it worse<br>
than it was, that a woman that had anything agreeable in her appearance<br>
could never want followers.<br>
<br>
I soon found myself thronged with admirers, and I received visits from<br>
some persons of very great figure, who always introduced themselves by<br>
the help of an old lady or two who were now become my intimates; and one<br>
of them, I understood afterwards, was set to work on purpose to get into<br>
my favour, in order to introduce what followed.<br>
<br>
The conversation we had was generally courtly, but civil. At length some<br>
gentlemen proposed to play, and made what they called a party. This, it<br>
seems, was a contrivance of one of my female hangers-on, for, as I<br>
said, I had two of them, who thought this was the way to introduce<br>
people as often as she pleased; and so indeed it was. They played high<br>
and stayed late, but begged my pardon, only asked leave to make an<br>
appointment for the next night. I was as gay and as well pleased as any<br>
of them, and one night told one of the gentlemen, my Lord ----, that<br>
seeing they were doing me the honour of diverting themselves at my<br>
apartment, and desired to be there sometimes, I did not keep a<br>
gaming-table, but I would give them a little ball the next day if they<br>
pleased, which they accepted very willingly.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, in the evening the gentlemen began to come, where I let<br>
them see that I understood very well what such things meant. I had a<br>
large dining-room in my apartments, with five other rooms on the same<br>
floor, all which I made drawing-rooms for the occasion, having all the<br>
beds taken down for the day. In three of these I had tables placed,<br>
covered with wine and sweetmeats, the fourth had a green table for play,<br>
and the fifth was my own room, where I sat, and where I received all the<br>
company that came to pay their compliments to me. I was dressed, you may<br>
be sure, to all the advantage possible, and had all the jewels on that I<br>
was mistress of. My Lord ----, to whom I had made the invitation, sent me<br>
a set of fine music from the playhouse, and the ladies danced, and we<br>
began to be very merry, when about eleven o'clock I had notice given me<br>
that there were some gentlemen coming in masquerade. I seemed a little<br>
surprised, and began to apprehend some disturbance, when my Lord ----<br>
perceiving it, spoke to me to be easy, for that there was a party of the<br>
guards at the door which should be ready to prevent any rudeness; and<br>
another gentleman gave me a hint as if the king was among the masks. I<br>
coloured as red as blood itself could make a face look, and expressed a<br>
great surprise; however, there was no going back, so I kept my station<br>
in my drawing-room, but with the folding-doors wide open.<br>
<br>
A while after the masks came in, and began with a dance _&agrave; la comique_,<br>
performing wonderfully indeed. While they were dancing I withdrew, and<br>
left a lady to answer for me that I would return immediately. In less<br>
than half-an-hour I returned, dressed in the habit of a Turkish<br>
princess; the habit I got at Leghorn, when my foreign prince bought me a<br>
Turkish slave, as I have said. The Maltese man-of-war had, it seems,<br>
taken a Turkish vessel going from Constantinople to Alexandria, in which<br>
were some ladies bound for Grand Cairo in Egypt; and as the ladies were<br>
made slaves, so their fine clothes were thus exposed; and with this<br>
Turkish slave I bought the rich clothes too. The dress was<br>
extraordinary fine indeed; I had bought it as a curiosity, having never<br>
seen the like. The robe was a fine Persian or India damask, the ground<br>
white, and the flowers blue and gold, and the train held five yards. The<br>
dress under it was a vest of the same, embroidered with gold, and set<br>
with some pearl in the work and some turquoise stones. To the vest was a<br>
girdle five or six inches wide, after the Turkish mode; and on both ends<br>
where it joined, or hooked, was set with diamonds for eight inches<br>
either way, only they were not true diamonds, but nobody knew that but<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
The turban, or head-dress, had a pinnacle on the top, but not above five<br>
inches, with a piece of loose sarcenet hanging from it; and on the<br>
front, just over the forehead, was a good jewel which I had added to it.<br>
<br>
This habit, as above, cost me about sixty pistoles in Italy, but cost<br>
much more in the country from whence it came; and little did I think<br>
when I bought it that I should put it to such a use as this, though I<br>
had dressed myself in it many times by the help of my little Turk, and<br>
afterwards between Amy and I, only to see how I looked in it. I had sent<br>
her up before to get it ready, and when I came up I had nothing to do<br>
but slip it on, and was down in my drawing-room in a little more than a<br>
quarter of an hour. When I came there the room was full of company; but<br>
I ordered the folding-doors to be shut for a minute or two till I had<br>
received the compliments of the ladies that were in the room, and had<br>
given them a full view of my dress.<br>
<br>
But my Lord ----, who happened to be in the room, slipped out at another<br>
door, and brought back with him one of the masks, a tall, well-shaped<br>
person, but who had no name, being all masked; nor would it have been<br>
allowed to ask any person's name on such an occasion. The person spoke<br>
in French to me, that it was the finest dress he had ever seen, and<br>
asked me if he should have the honour to dance with me. I bowed, as<br>
giving my consent, but said, as I had been a Mahometan, I could not<br>
dance after the manner of this country; I supposed their music would not<br>
play _&agrave; la Moresque_. He answered merrily. I had a Christian's face, and<br>
he'd venture it that I could dance like a Christian; adding that so much<br>
beauty could not be Mahometan. Immediately the folding-doors were flung<br>
open, and he led me into the room. The company were under the greatest<br>
surprise imaginable; the very music stopped awhile to gaze, for the<br>
dress was indeed exceedingly surprising, perfectly new, very agreeable,<br>
and wonderful rich.<br>
<br>
The gentleman, whoever he was, for I never knew, led me only _&agrave;<br>
courant_, and then asked me if I had a mind to dance an antic--that is<br>
to say, whether I would dance the antic as they had danced in<br>
masquerade, or anything by myself. I told him anything else rather, if<br>
he pleased; so we danced only two French dances, and he led me to the<br>
drawing-room door, when he retired to the rest of the masks. When he<br>
left me at the drawing-room door I did not go in, as he thought I would<br>
have done, but turned about and showed myself to the whole room, and<br>
calling my woman to me, gave her some directions to the music, by which<br>
the company presently understood that I would give them a dance by<br>
myself. Immediately all the house rose up and paid me a kind of a<br>
compliment by removing back every way to make me room, for the place was<br>
exceedingly full. The music did not at first hit the tune that I<br>
directed, which was a French tune, so I was forced to send my woman to<br>
them again, standing all this while at my drawing-room door; but as soon<br>
as my woman spoke to them again, they played it right, and I, to let<br>
them see it was so, stepped forward to the middle of the room. Then they<br>
began it again, and I danced by myself a figure which I learnt in<br>
France, when the Prince de ---- desired I would dance for his diversion.<br>
It was, indeed, a very fine figure, invented by a famous master at<br>
Paris, for a lady or a gentleman to dance single; but being perfectly<br>
new, it pleased the company exceedingly, and they all thought it had<br>
been Turkish; nay, one gentleman had the folly to expose himself so<br>
much as to say, and I think swore too, that he had seen it danced at<br>
Constantinople, which was ridiculous enough.<br>
<br>
At the finishing the dance the company clapped, and almost shouted; and<br>
one of the gentlemen cried out &quot;Roxana! Roxana! by ----,&quot; with an oath;<br>
upon which foolish accident I had the name of Roxana presently fixed<br>
upon me all over the court end of town as effectually as if I had been<br>
christened Roxana. I had, it seems, the felicity of pleasing everybody<br>
that night to an extreme; and my ball, but especially my dress, was the<br>
chat of the town for that week; and so the name of Roxana was the toast<br>
at and about the court; no other health was to be named with it.<br>
<br>
Now things began to work as I would have them, and I began to be very<br>
popular, as much as I could desire. The ball held till (as well as I was<br>
pleased with the show) I was sick of the night; the gentlemen masked<br>
went off about three o'clock in the morning, the other gentlemen sat<br>
down to play; the music held it out, and some of the ladies were dancing<br>
at six in the morning.<br>
<br>
But I was mighty eager to know who it was danced with me. Some of the<br>
lords went so far as to tell me I was very much honoured in my company;<br>
one of them spoke so broad as almost to say it was the king, but I was<br>
convinced afterwards it was not; and another replied if he had been his<br>
Majesty he should have thought it no dishonour to lead up a Roxana; but<br>
to this hour I never knew positively who it was; and by his behaviour I<br>
thought he was too young, his Majesty being at that time in an age that<br>
might be discovered from a young person, even in his dancing.<br>
<br>
Be that as it would, I had five hundred guineas sent me the next<br>
morning, and the messenger was ordered to tell me that the persons who<br>
sent it desired a ball again at my lodgings on the next Tuesday, but<br>
that they would have my leave to give the entertainment themselves. I<br>
was mighty well pleased with this, to be sure, but very inquisitive to<br>
know who the money came from; but the messenger was silent as death as<br>
to that point, and bowing always at my inquiries, begged me to ask no<br>
questions which he could not give an obliging answer to.<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention, that the gentlemen that played gave a hundred<br>
guineas to the box, as they called it, and at the end of their play they<br>
asked for my gentlewoman of the bedchamber, as they called her (Mrs.<br>
Amy, forsooth), and gave it her, and gave twenty guineas more among the<br>
servants.<br>
<br>
These magnificent doings equally both pleased and surprised me, and I<br>
hardly knew where I was; but especially that notion of the king being<br>
the person that danced with me, puffed me up to that degree, that I not<br>
only did not know anybody else, but indeed was very far from knowing<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
I had now, the next Tuesday, to provide for the like company. But, alas!<br>
it was all taken out of my hand. Three gentlemen, who yet were, it<br>
seems, but servants, came on the Saturday, and bringing sufficient<br>
testimonies that they were right, for one was the same who brought the<br>
five hundred guineas; I say, three of them came, and brought bottles of<br>
all sorts of wines, and hampers of sweetmeats to such a quantity, it<br>
appeared they designed to hold the trade on more than once, and that<br>
they would furnish everything to a profusion.<br>
<br>
However, as I found a deficiency in two things, I made provision of<br>
about twelve dozen of fine damask napkins, with tablecloths of the same,<br>
sufficient to cover all the tables, with three tablecloths upon every<br>
table, and sideboards in proportion. Also I bought a handsome quantity<br>
of plate, necessary to have served all the sideboards; but the gentlemen<br>
would not suffer any of it to be used, telling me they had bought fine<br>
china dishes and plates for the whole service, and that in such public<br>
places they could not be answerable for the plate. So it was set all up<br>
in a large glass cupboard in the room I sat in, where it made a very<br>
good show indeed.<br>
<br>
On Tuesday there came such an appearance of gentlemen and ladies, that<br>
my apartments were by no means able to receive them, and those who in<br>
particular appeared as principals gave order below to let no more<br>
company come up. The street was full of coaches with coronets, and fine<br>
glass chairs, and, in short, it was impossible to receive the company. I<br>
kept my little room as before, and the dancers filled the great room;<br>
all the drawing-rooms also were filled, and three rooms below stairs,<br>
which were not mine.<br>
<br>
It was very well that there was a strong party of the guards brought to<br>
keep the door, for without that there had been such a promiscuous crowd,<br>
and some of them scandalous too, that we should have been all disorder<br>
and confusion; but the three head servants managed all that, and had a<br>
word to admit all the company by.<br>
<br>
It was uncertain to me, and is to this day, who it was that danced with<br>
me the Wednesday before, when the ball was my own; but that the king was<br>
at this assembly was out of question with me, by circumstances that, I<br>
suppose, I could not be deceived in, and particularly that there were<br>
five persons who were not masked; three of them had blue garters, and<br>
they appeared not to me till I came out to dance.<br>
<br>
This meeting was managed just as the first, though with much more<br>
magnificence, because of the company. I placed myself (exceedingly rich<br>
in clothes and jewels) in the middle of my little room, as before, and<br>
made my compliment to all the company as they passed me, as I did<br>
before. But my Lord ----, who had spoken openly to me the first night,<br>
came to me, and, unmasking, told me the company had ordered him to tell<br>
me they hoped they should see me in the dress I had appeared in the<br>
first day, which had been so acceptable that it had been the occasion of<br>
this new meeting. &quot;And, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;there are some in this<br>
assembly who it is worth your while to oblige.&quot;<br>
<br>
I bowed to my Lord ----, and immediately withdrew. While I was above,<br>
a-dressing in my new habit, two ladies, perfectly unknown to me, were<br>
conveyed into my apartment below, by the order of a noble person, who,<br>
with his family, had been in Persia; and here, indeed, I thought I<br>
should have been outdone, or perhaps balked.<br>
<br>
One of these ladies was dressed most exquisitely fine indeed, in the<br>
habit of a virgin lady of quality of Georgia, and the other in the same<br>
habit of Armenia, with each of them a woman slave to attend them.<br>
<br>
The ladies had their petticoats short to their ankles, but plaited all<br>
round, and before them short aprons, but of the finest point that could<br>
be seen. Their gowns were made with long antique sleeves hanging down<br>
behind, and a train let down. They had no jewels, but their heads and<br>
breasts were dressed up with flowers, and they both came in veiled.<br>
<br>
Their slaves were bareheaded, but their long, black hair was braided in<br>
locks hanging down behind to their waists, and tied up with ribands.<br>
They were dressed exceeding rich, and were as beautiful as their<br>
mistresses; for none of them had any masks on. They waited in my room<br>
till I came down, and all paid their respects to me after the Persian<br>
manner, and sat down on a safra--that is to say, almost crosslegged, on<br>
a couch made up of cushions laid on the ground.<br>
<br>
This was admirably fine, and I was indeed startled at it. They made<br>
their compliment to me in French, and I replied in the same language.<br>
When the doors were opened, they walked into the dancing-room, and<br>
danced such a dance as indeed nobody there had ever seen, and to an<br>
instrument like a guitar, with a small low-sounding trumpet, which<br>
indeed was very fine, and which my Lord ---- had provided.<br>
<br>
They danced three times all alone, for nobody indeed could dance with<br>
them. The novelty pleased, truly, but yet there was something wild and<br>
_bizarre_ in it, because they really acted to the life the barbarous<br>
country whence they came; but as mine had the French behaviour under the<br>
Mahometan dress, it was every way as new, and pleased much better<br>
indeed.<br>
<br>
As soon as they had shown their Georgian and Armenian shapes, and<br>
danced, as I have said, three times, they withdrew, paid their<br>
compliment to me (for I was queen of the day), and went off to undress.<br>
<br>
Some gentlemen then danced with ladies all in masks; and when they<br>
stopped, nobody rose up to dance, but all called out &quot;Roxana, Roxana.&quot;<br>
In the interval, my Lord ---- had brought another masked person into my<br>
room, who I knew not, only that I could discern it was not the same<br>
person that led me out before. This noble person (for I afterwards<br>
understood it was the Duke of ----), after a short compliment, led me<br>
out into the middle of the room.<br>
<br>
I was dressed in the same vest and girdle as before, but the robe had a<br>
mantle over it, which is usual in the Turkish habit, and it was of<br>
crimson and green, the green brocaded with gold; and my tyhiaai, or<br>
head-dress, varied a little from that I had before, as it stood higher,<br>
and had some jewels about the rising part, which made it look like a<br>
turban crowned.<br>
<br>
I had no mask, neither did I paint, and yet I had the day of all the<br>
ladies that appeared at the ball, I mean of those that appeared with<br>
faces on. As for those masked, nothing could be said of them, no doubt<br>
there might be many finer than I was; it must be confessed that the<br>
habit was infinitely advantageous to me, and everybody looked at me with<br>
a kind of pleasure, which gave me great advantage too.<br>
<br>
After I had danced with that noble person, I did not offer to dance by<br>
myself, as I had before; but they all called out &quot;Roxana&quot; again; and two<br>
of the gentlemen came into the drawing-room to entreat me to give them<br>
the Turkish dance, which I yielded to readily, so I came out and danced<br>
just as at first.<br>
<br>
While I was dancing, I perceived five persons standing all together, and<br>
among them only one with his hat on. It was an immediate hint to me who<br>
it was, and had at first almost put me into some disorder; but I went<br>
on, received the applause of the house, as before, and retired into my<br>
own room. When I was there, the five gentlemen came across the room to<br>
my side, and, coming in, followed by a throng of great persons, the<br>
person with his hat on said, &quot;Madam Roxana, you perform to admiration.&quot;<br>
I was prepared, and offered to kneel to kiss his hand, but he declined<br>
it, and saluted me, and so, passing back again through the great room,<br>
went away.<br>
<br>
I do not say here who this was, but I say I came afterwards to know<br>
something more plainly. I would have withdrawn, and disrobed, being<br>
somewhat too thin in that dress, unlaced and open-breasted, as if I had<br>
been in my shift; but it could not be, and I was obliged to dance<br>
afterwards with six or eight gentlemen most, if not all of them, of the<br>
first rank; and I was told afterwards that one of them was the Duke of<br>
M[onmou]th.<br>
<br>
About two or three o'clock in the morning the company began to decrease;<br>
the number of women especially dropped away home, some and some at a<br>
time; and the gentlemen retired downstairs, where they unmasked and went<br>
to play.<br>
<br>
Amy waited at the room where they played, sat up all night to attend<br>
them, and in the morning when they broke up they swept the box into her<br>
lap, when she counted out to me sixty-two guineas and a half; and the<br>
other servants got very well too. Amy came to me when they were all<br>
gone; &quot;Law, madam,&quot; says Amy, with a long gaping cry, &quot;what shall I do<br>
with all this money?&quot; And indeed the poor creature was half mad with<br>
joy.<br>
<br>
I was now in my element. I was as much talked of as anybody could<br>
desire, and I did not doubt but something or other would come of it; but<br>
the report of my being so rich rather was a balk to my view than<br>
anything else; for the gentlemen that would perhaps have been<br>
troublesome enough otherwise, seemed to be kept off, for Roxana was too<br>
high for them.<br>
<br>
There is a scene which came in here which I must cover from human eyes<br>
or ears. For three years and about a month Roxana lived retired, having<br>
been obliged to make an excursion in a manner, and with a person which<br>
duty and private vows obliges her not to reveal, at least not yet.<br>
<br>
At the end of this time I appeared again; but, I must add, that as I had<br>
in this time of retreat made hay, &amp;c., so I did not come abroad again<br>
with the same lustre, or shine with so much advantage as before. For as<br>
some people had got at least a suspicion of where I had been, and who<br>
had had me all the while, it began to be public that Roxana was, in<br>
short, a mere Roxana, neither better nor worse, and not that woman of<br>
honour and virtue that was at first supposed.<br>
<br>
You are now to suppose me about seven years come to town, and that I had<br>
not only suffered the old revenue, which I hinted was managed by Sir<br>
Robert Clayton, to grow, as was mentioned before, but I had laid up an<br>
incredible wealth, the time considered; and had I yet had the least<br>
thought of reforming, I had all the opportunity to do it with advantage<br>
that ever woman had. For the common vice of all whores, I mean money,<br>
was out of the question, nay, even avarice itself seemed to be glutted;<br>
for, including what I had saved in reserving the interest of &pound;14,000,<br>
which, as above, I had left to grow, and including some very good<br>
presents I had made to me in mere compliment upon these shining<br>
masquerading meetings, which I held up for about two years, and what I<br>
made of three years of the most glorious retreat, as I call it, that<br>
ever woman had, I had fully doubled my first substance, and had near<br>
&pound;5000 in money which I kept at home, besides abundance of plate and<br>
jewels, which I had either given me or had bought to set myself out for<br>
public days.<br>
<br>
In a word, I had now five-and-thirty thousand pounds estate; and as I<br>
found ways to live without wasting either principal or interest, I laid<br>
up &pound;2000 every year at least out of the mere interest, adding it to the<br>
principal, and thus I went on.<br>
<br>
After the end of what I call my retreat, and out of which I brought a<br>
great deal of money, I appeared again, but I seemed like an old piece of<br>
plate that had been hoarded up some years, and comes out tarnished and<br>
discoloured; so I came out blown, and looked like a cast-off mistress;<br>
nor, indeed, was I any better, though I was not at all impaired in<br>
beauty except that I was a little fatter than I was formerly, and always<br>
granting that I was four years older.<br>
<br>
However, I preserved the youth of my temper, was always bright, pleasant<br>
in company, and agreeable to everybody, or else everybody flattered me;<br>
and in this condition I came abroad to the world again. And though I was<br>
not so popular as before, and indeed did not seek it, because I knew it<br>
could not be, yet I was far from being without company, and that of the<br>
greatest quality (of subjects I mean), who frequently visited me, and<br>
sometimes we had meetings for mirth and play at my apartments, where I<br>
failed not to divert them in the most agreeable manner possible.<br>
<br>
Nor could any of them make the least particular application to me, from<br>
the notion they had of my excessive wealth, which, as they thought,<br>
placed me above the meanness of a maintenance, and so left no room to<br>
come easily about me.<br>
<br>
But at last I was very handsomely attacked by a person of honour, and<br>
(which recommended him particularly to me) a person of a very great<br>
estate. He made a long introduction to me upon the subject of my wealth.<br>
&quot;Ignorant creature!&quot; said I to myself, considering him as a lord, &quot;was<br>
there ever woman in the world that could stoop to the baseness of being<br>
a whore, and was above taking the reward of her vice! No, no, depend<br>
upon it, if your lordship obtains anything of me, you must pay for it;<br>
and the notion of my being so rich serves only to make it cost you the<br>
dearer, seeing you cannot offer a small matter to a woman of &pound;2000 a<br>
year estate.&quot;<br>
<br>
After he had harangued upon that subject a good while, and had assured<br>
me he had no design upon me, that he did not come to make a prize of me,<br>
or to pick my pocket, which, by the way, I was in no fear of, for I took<br>
too much care of my money to part with any of it that way, he then<br>
turned his discourse to the subject of love, a point so ridiculous to me<br>
without the main thing, I mean the money, that I had no patience to hear<br>
him make so long a story of it.<br>
<br>
I received him civilly, and let him see I could bear to hear a wicked<br>
proposal without being affronted, and yet I was not to be brought into<br>
it too easily. He visited me a long while, and, in short, courted me as<br>
closely and assiduously as if he had been wooing me to matrimony. He<br>
made me several valuable presents, which I suffered myself to be<br>
prevailed with to accept, but not without great difficulty.<br>
<br>
Gradually I suffered also his other importunities; and when he made a<br>
proposal of a compliment or appointment to me for a settlement, he said<br>
that though I was rich, yet there was not the less due from him to<br>
acknowledge the favours he received; and that if I was to be his I<br>
should not live at my own expense, cost what it would. I told him I was<br>
far from being extravagant, and yet I did not live at the expense of<br>
less than &pound;500 a year out of my own pocket; that, however, I was not<br>
covetous of settled allowances, for I looked upon that as a kind of<br>
golden chain, something like matrimony; that though I knew how to be<br>
true to a man of honour, as I knew his lordship to be, yet I had a kind<br>
of aversion to the bonds; and though I was not so rich as the world<br>
talked me up to be, yet I was not so poor as to bind myself to hardships<br>
for a pension.<br>
<br>
He told me he expected to make my life perfectly easy, and intended it<br>
so; that he knew of no bondage there could be in a private engagement<br>
between us; that the bonds of honour he knew I would be tied by, and<br>
think them no burthen; and for other obligations, he scorned to expect<br>
anything from me but what he knew as a woman of honour I could grant.<br>
Then as to maintenance, he told me he would soon show me that he valued<br>
me infinitely above &pound;500 a year, and upon this foot we began.<br>
<br>
I seemed kinder to him after this discourse, and as time and private<br>
conversation made us very intimate, we began to come nearer to the main<br>
article, namely, the &pound;500 a year. He offered that at first word, and to<br>
acknowledge it as an infinite favour to have it be accepted of; and I,<br>
that thought it was too much by all the money, suffered myself to be<br>
mastered, or prevailed with to yield, even on but a bare engagement upon<br>
parole.<br>
<br>
When he had obtained his end that way, I told him my mind. &quot;Now you<br>
see, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;how weakly I have acted, namely, to yield to you<br>
without any capitulation, or anything secured to me but that which you<br>
may cease to allow when you please. If I am the less valued for such a<br>
confidence, I shall be injured in a manner that I will endeavour not to<br>
deserve.&quot;<br>
<br>
He told me that he would make it evident to me that he did not seek me<br>
by way of bargain, as such things were often done; that as I had treated<br>
him with a generous confidence, so I should find I was in the hands of a<br>
man of honour, and one that knew how to value the obligation; and upon<br>
this he pulled out a goldsmith's bill for &pound;300, which (putting it into<br>
my hand), he said, he gave me as a pledge that I should not be a loser<br>
by my not having made a bargain with him.<br>
<br>
This was engaging indeed, and gave me a good idea of our future<br>
correspondence; and, in short, as I could not refrain treating him with<br>
more kindness than I had done before, so one thing begetting another, I<br>
gave him several testimonies that I was entirely his own by inclination<br>
as well as by the common obligation of a mistress, and this pleased him<br>
exceedingly.<br>
<br>
Soon after this private engagement I began to consider whether it were<br>
not more suitable to the manner of life I now led to be a little less<br>
public; and, as I told my lord, it would rid me of the importunities of<br>
others, and of continual visits from a sort of people who he knew of,<br>
and who, by the way, having now got the notion of me which I really<br>
deserved, began to talk of the old game, love and gallantry, and to<br>
offer at what was rude enough--things as nauseous to me now as if I had<br>
been married and as virtuous as other people. The visits of these people<br>
began indeed to be uneasy to me, and particularly as they were always<br>
very tedious and impertinent; nor could my Lord ---- be pleased with<br>
them at all if they had gone on. It would be diverting to set down here<br>
in what manner I repulsed these sort of people; how in some I resented<br>
it as an affront, and told them that I was sorry they should oblige me<br>
to vindicate myself from the scandal of such suggestions by telling them<br>
that I could see them no more, and by desiring them not to give<br>
themselves the trouble of visiting me, who, though I was not willing to<br>
be uncivil, yet thought myself obliged never to receive any visit from<br>
any gentleman after he had made such proposals as those to me. But these<br>
things would be too tedious to bring in here. It was on this account I<br>
proposed to his lordship my taking new lodgings for privacy; besides, I<br>
considered that as I might live very handsomely, and yet not so<br>
publicly, so I needed not spend so much money by a great deal; and if I<br>
made &pound;500 a year of this generous person, it was more than I had any<br>
occasion to spend by a great deal.<br>
<br>
My lord came readily into this proposal, and went further than I<br>
expected, for he found out a lodging for me in a very handsome house,<br>
where yet he was not known--I suppose he had employed somebody to find<br>
it out for him--and where he had a convenient way to come into the<br>
garden by a door that opened into the park, a thing very rarely allowed<br>
in those times.<br>
<br>
By this key he could come in at what time of night or day he pleased;<br>
and as we had also a little door in the lower part of the house which<br>
was always left upon a lock, and his was the master-key, so if it was<br>
twelve, one, or two o'clock at night, he could come directly into my<br>
bedchamber. _N.B._--I was not afraid I should be found abed with anybody<br>
else, for, in a word, I conversed with nobody at all.<br>
<br>
It happened pleasantly enough one night, his lordship had stayed late,<br>
and I, not expecting him that night, had taken Amy to bed with me, and<br>
when my lord came into the chamber we were both fast asleep. I think it<br>
was near three o'clock when he came in, and a little merry, but not at<br>
all fuddled or what they call in drink; and he came at once into the<br>
room.<br>
<br>
Amy was frighted out of her wits, and cried out. I said calmly, &quot;Indeed,<br>
my lord, I did not expect you to-night, and we have been a little<br>
frighted to-night with fire.&quot; &quot;Oh!&quot; says he, &quot;I see you have got a<br>
bedfellow with you.&quot; I began to make an apology. &quot;No, no,&quot; says my lord,<br>
&quot;you need no excuse, 'tis not a man bedfellow, I see;&quot; but then, talking<br>
merrily enough, he catched his words back: &quot;But, hark ye,&quot; says he, &quot;now<br>
I think on 't, how shall I be satisfied it is not a man bedfellow?&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; says I, &quot;I dare say your lordship is satisfied 'tis poor Amy.&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says he, &quot;'tis Mrs. Amy; but how do I know what Amy is? it may be<br>
Mr. Amy for aught I know; I hope you'll give me leave to be satisfied.&quot;<br>
I told him, yes, by all means, I would have his lordship satisfied; but<br>
I supposed he knew who she was.<br>
<br>
Well, he fell foul of poor Amy, and indeed I thought once he would have<br>
carried the jest on before my face, as was once done in a like case; but<br>
his lordship was not so hot neither, but he would know whether Amy was<br>
Mr. Amy or Mrs. Amy, and so, I suppose, he did; and then being satisfied<br>
in that doubtful case, he walked to the farther end of the room, and<br>
went into a little closet and sat down.<br>
<br>
In the meantime Amy and I got up, and I bid her run and make the bed in<br>
another chamber for my lord, and I gave her sheets to put into it; which<br>
she did immediately, and I put my lord to bed there, and when I had<br>
done, at his desire went to bed to him. I was backward at first to come<br>
to bed to him, and made my excuse because I had been in bed with Amy,<br>
and had not shifted me; but he was past those niceties at that time; and<br>
as long as he was sure it was Mrs. Amy, and not Mr. Amy, he was very<br>
well satisfied, and so the jest passed over. But Amy appeared no more<br>
all that night, or the next day, and when she did, my lord was so merry<br>
with her upon his eclaircissement, as he called it, that Amy did not<br>
know what to do with herself.<br>
<br>
Not that Amy was such a nice lady in the main, if she had been fairly<br>
dealt with, as has appeared in the former part of this work; but now she<br>
was surprised, and a little hurried, that she scarce knew where she was;<br>
and besides, she was, as to his lordship, as nice a lady as any in the<br>
world, and for anything he knew of her she appeared as such. The rest<br>
was to us only that knew of it.<br>
<br>
I held this wicked scene of life out eight years, reckoning from my<br>
first coming to England; and though my lord found no fault, yet I found,<br>
without much examining, that any one who looked in my face might see I<br>
was above twenty years old; and yet, without flattering myself, I<br>
carried my age, which was above fifty, very well too.<br>
<br>
I may venture to say that no woman ever lived a life like me, of<br>
six-and-twenty years of wickedness, without the least signals of<br>
remorse, without any signs of repentance, or without so much as a wish<br>
to put an end to it; I had so long habituated myself to a life of vice,<br>
that really it appeared to be no vice to me. I went on smooth and<br>
pleasant, I wallowed in wealth, and it flowed in upon me at such a rate,<br>
having taken the frugal measures that the good knight directed, so that<br>
I had at the end of the eight years two thousand eight hundred pounds<br>
coming yearly in, of which I did not spend one penny, being maintained<br>
by my allowance from my Lord ----, and more than maintained by above<br>
&pound;200 per annum; for though he did not contract for &pound;500 a year, as I<br>
made dumb signs to have it be, yet he gave me money so often, and that<br>
in such large parcels, that I had seldom so little as seven to eight<br>
hundred pounds a year of him, one year with another.<br>

<br>
_&quot;There,&quot; says she (ushering him in), &quot;is the person who, I suppose,<br>
thou inquirest for&quot;_<br>
<br>
PAGE 338]<br>
<br>
I must go back here, after telling openly the wicked things I did, to<br>
mention something which, however, had the face of doing good. I<br>
remembered that when I went from England, which was fifteen years<br>
before, I had left five little children, turned out as it were to the<br>
wide world, and to the charity of their father's relations; the eldest<br>
was not six years old, for we had not been married full seven years when<br>
their father went away.<br>
<br>
After my coming to England I was greatly desirous to hear how things<br>
stood with them, and whether they were all alive or not, and in what<br>
manner they had been maintained; and yet I resolved not to discover<br>
myself to them in the least, or to let any of the people that had the<br>
breeding of them up know that there was such a body left in the world as<br>
their mother.<br>
<br>
Amy was the only body I could trust with such a commission, and I sent<br>
her into Spitalfields, to the old aunt and to the poor woman that were<br>
so instrumental in disposing the relations to take some care of the<br>
children, but they were both gone, dead and buried some years. The next<br>
inquiry she made was at the house where she carried the poor children,<br>
and turned them in at the door. When she came there she found the house<br>
inhabited by other people, so that she could make little or nothing of<br>
her inquiries, and came back with an answer that indeed was no answer to<br>
me, for it gave me no satisfaction at all. I sent her back to inquire in<br>
the neighbourhood what was become of the family that lived in that<br>
house; and if they were removed, where they lived, and what<br>
circumstances they were in; and, withal, if she could, what became of<br>
the poor children, and how they lived, and where; how they had been<br>
treated; and the like.<br>
<br>
She brought me back word upon this second going, that she heard, as to<br>
the family, that the husband, who, though but uncle-in-law to the<br>
children, had yet been kindest to them, was dead; and that the widow was<br>
left but in mean circumstances--that is to say, she did not want, but<br>
that she was not so well in the world as she was thought to be when her<br>
husband was alive; that, as to the poor children, two of them, it seems,<br>
had been kept by her, that is to say, by her husband, while he lived,<br>
for that it was against her will, that we all knew; but the honest<br>
neighbours pitied the poor children, they said, heartily; for that their<br>
aunt used them barbarously, and made them little better than servants in<br>
the house to wait upon her and her children, and scarce allowed them<br>
clothes fit to wear.<br>
<br>
These were, it seems, my eldest and third, which were daughters; the<br>
second was a son, the fourth a daughter, and the youngest a son.<br>
<br>
To finish the melancholy part of this history of my two unhappy girls,<br>
she brought me word that as soon as they were able to go out and get any<br>
work they went from her, and some said she had turned them out of doors;<br>
but it seems she had not done so, but she used them so cruelly that they<br>
left her, and one of them went to service to a neighbour's, a little way<br>
off, who knew her, an honest, substantial weaver's wife, to whom she was<br>
chambermaid, and in a little time she took her sister out of the<br>
Bridewell of her aunt's house, and got her a place too.<br>
<br>
This was all melancholy and dull. I sent her then to the weaver's house,<br>
where the eldest had lived, but found that, her mistress being dead, she<br>
was gone, and nobody knew there whither she went, only that they heard<br>
she had lived with a great lady at the other end of the town; but they<br>
did not know who that lady was.<br>
<br>
These inquiries took us up three or four weeks, and I was not one jot<br>
the better for it, for I could hear nothing to my satisfaction. I sent<br>
her next to find out the honest man who, as in the beginning of my story<br>
I observed, made them be entertained, and caused the youngest to be<br>
fetched from the town where we lived, and where the parish officers had<br>
taken care of him. This gentleman was still alive; and there she heard<br>
that my youngest daughter and eldest son was dead also; but that my<br>
youngest son was alive, and was at that time about seventeen years old,<br>
and that he was put out apprentice by the kindness and charity of his<br>
uncle, but to a mean trade, and at which he was obliged to work very<br>
hard.<br>
<br>
Amy was so curious in this part that she went immediately to see him,<br>
and found him all dirty and hard at work. She had no remembrance at all<br>
of the youth, for she had not seen him since he was about two years old;<br>
and it was evident he could have no knowledge of her.<br>
<br>
However, she talked with him, and found him a good, sensible, mannerly<br>
youth; that he knew little of the story of his father or mother, and had<br>
no view of anything but to work hard for his living; and she did not<br>
think fit to put any great things into his head, lest it should take him<br>
off of his business, and perhaps make him turn giddy-headed and be good<br>
for nothing; but she went and found out that kind man, his benefactor,<br>
who had put him out, and finding him a plain, well-meaning, honest, and<br>
kind-hearted man, she opened her tale to him the easier. She made a long<br>
story, how she had a prodigious kindness for the child, because she had<br>
the same for his father and mother; told him that she was the<br>
servant-maid that brought all of them to their aunt's door, and run away<br>
and left them; that their poor mother wanted bread, and what came of her<br>
after she would have been glad to know. She added that her circumstances<br>
had happened to mend in the world, and that, as she was in condition,<br>
so she was disposed to show some kindness to the children if she could<br>
find them out.<br>
<br>
He received her with all the civility that so kind a proposal demanded,<br>
gave her an account of what he had done for the child, how he had<br>
maintained him, fed and clothed him, put him to school, and at last put<br>
him out to a trade. She said he had indeed been a father to the child.<br>
&quot;But, sir,&quot; says she, &quot;'tis a very laborious, hard-working trade, and he<br>
is but a thin, weak boy.&quot; &quot;That's true,&quot; says he; &quot;but the boy chose the<br>
trade, and I assure you I gave &pound;20 with him, and am to find him clothes<br>
all his apprenticeship; and as to its being a hard trade,&quot; says he,<br>
&quot;that's the fate of his circumstances, poor boy. I could not well do<br>
better for him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sir, as you did all for him in charity,&quot; says she, &quot;it was<br>
exceeding well; but, as my resolution is to do something for him, I<br>
desire you will, if possible, take him away again from that place, where<br>
he works so hard, for I cannot bear to see the child work so very hard<br>
for his bread, and I will do something for him that shall make him live<br>
without such hard labour.&quot;<br>
<br>
He smiled at that. &quot;I can, indeed,&quot; says he, &quot;take him away, but then I<br>
must lose my &pound;20 that I gave with him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Amy, &quot;I'll enable you to lose that &pound;20 immediately;&quot;<br>
and so she put her hand in her pocket and pulls out her purse.<br>
<br>
He begun to be a little amazed at her, and looked her hard in the face,<br>
and that so very much that she took notice of it, and said, &quot;Sir, I<br>
fancy by your looking at me you think you know me, but I am assured you<br>
do not, for I never saw your face before. I think you have done enough<br>
for the child, and that you ought to be acknowledged as a father to him;<br>
but you ought not to lose by your kindness to him, more than the<br>
kindness of bringing him up obliges you to; and therefore there's the<br>
&pound;20,&quot; added she, &quot;and pray let him be fetched away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;I will thank you for the boy, as well as for<br>
myself; but will you please to tell me what I must do with him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sir,&quot; says Amy, &quot;as you have been so kind to keep him so many years, I<br>
beg you will take him home again one year more, and I'll bring you a<br>
hundred pounds more, which I will desire you to lay out in schooling and<br>
clothes for him, and to pay you for his board. Perhaps I may put him in<br>
a condition to return your kindness.&quot;<br>
<br>
He looked pleased, but surprised very much, and inquired of Amy, but<br>
with very great respect, what he should go to school to learn, and what<br>
trade she would please to put him out to.<br>
<br>
Amy said he should put him to learn a little Latin, and then merchants'<br>
accounts, and to write a good hand, for she would have him be put to a<br>
Turkey merchant.<br>
<br>
&quot;Madam,&quot; says he, &quot;I am glad for his sake to hear you talk so; but do<br>
you know that a Turkey merchant will not take him under &pound;400 or &pound;500?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I know it very well.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And,&quot; says he, &quot;that it will require as many thousands to set him up?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I know that very well too;&quot; and, resolving to<br>
talk very big, she added, &quot;I have no children of my own, and I resolve<br>
to make him my heir, and if &pound;10,000 be required to set him up, he shall<br>
not want it. I was but his mother's servant when he was born, and I<br>
mourned heartily for the disaster of the family, and I always said, if<br>
ever I was worth anything in the world, I would take the child for my<br>
own, and I'll be as good as my word now, though I did not then foresee<br>
that it would be with me as it has been since.&quot; And so Amy told him a<br>
long story how she was troubled for me, and what she would give to hear<br>
whether I was dead or alive, and what circumstances I was in; that if<br>
she could but find me, if I was ever so poor, she would take care of me,<br>
and make a gentlewoman of me again.<br>
<br>
He told her that, as to the child's mother, she had been reduced to the<br>
last extremity, and was obliged (as he supposed she knew) to send the<br>
children all among her husband's friends; and if it had not been for<br>
him, they had all been sent to the parish; but that he obliged the other<br>
relations to share the charge among them; that he had taken two, whereof<br>
he had lost the eldest, who died of the smallpox, but that he had been<br>
as careful of this as of his own, and had made very little difference in<br>
their breeding up, only that when he came to put him out he thought it<br>
was best for the boy to put him to a trade which he might set up in<br>
without a stock, for otherwise his time would be lost; and that as to<br>
his mother, he had never been able to hear one word of her, no, not<br>
though he had made the utmost inquiry after her; that there went a<br>
report that she had drowned herself, but that he could never meet with<br>
anybody that could give him a certain account of it.<br>
<br>
Amy counterfeited a cry for her poor mistress; told him she would give<br>
anything in the world to see her, if she was alive; and a great deal<br>
more such-like talk they had about that; then they returned to speak of<br>
the boy.<br>
<br>
He inquired of her why she did not seek after the child before, that he<br>
might have been brought up from a younger age, suitable to what she<br>
designed to do for him.<br>
<br>
She told him she had been out of England, and was but newly returned<br>
from the East Indies. That she had been out of England, and was but<br>
newly returned, was true, but the latter was false, and was put in to<br>
blind him, and provide against farther inquiries; for it was not a<br>
strange thing for young women to go away poor to the East Indies, and<br>
come home vastly rich. So she went on with directions about him, and<br>
both agreed in this, that the boy should by no means be told what was<br>
intended for him, but only that he should be taken home again to his<br>
uncle's, that his uncle thought the trade too hard for him, and the<br>
like.<br>
<br>
About three days after this Amy goes again, and carried him the hundred<br>
pounds she promised him, but then Amy made quite another figure than she<br>
did before; for she went in my coach, with two footmen after her, and<br>
dressed very fine also, with jewels and a gold watch; and there was<br>
indeed no great difficulty to make Amy look like a lady, for she was a<br>
very handsome, well-shaped woman, and genteel enough. The coachman and<br>
servants were particularly ordered to show her the same respect as they<br>
would to me, and to call her Madam Collins, if they were asked any<br>
questions about her.<br>
<br>
When the gentleman saw what a figure she made it added to the former<br>
surprise, and he entertained her in the most respectful manner possible,<br>
congratulated her advancement in fortune, and particularly rejoiced that<br>
it should fall to the poor child's lot to be so provided for, contrary<br>
to all expectation.<br>
<br>
Well, Amy talked big, but very free and familiar, told them she had no<br>
pride in her good fortune (and that was true enough, for, to give Amy<br>
her due, she was far from it, and was as good-humoured a creature as<br>
ever lived); that she was the same as ever; and that she always loved<br>
this boy, and was resolved to do something extraordinary for him.<br>
<br>
Then she pulled out her money, and paid him down a hundred and twenty<br>
pounds, which, she said, she paid him that he might be sure he should<br>
be no loser by taking him home again, and that she would come and see<br>
him again, and talk farther about things with him, so that all might be<br>
settled for him, in such a manner as accidents, such as mortality, or<br>
anything else, should make no alteration to the child's prejudice.<br>
<br>
At this meeting the uncle brought his wife out, a good, motherly,<br>
comely, grave woman, who spoke very tenderly of the youth, and, as it<br>
appeared, had been very good to him, though she had several children of<br>
her own. After a long discourse, she put in a word of her own. &quot;Madam,&quot;<br>
says she, &quot;I am heartily glad of the good intentions you have for this<br>
poor orphan, and I rejoice sincerely in it for his sake; but, madam, you<br>
know, I suppose, that there are two sisters alive too; may we not speak<br>
a word for them? Poor girls,&quot; says she, &quot;they have not been so kindly<br>
used as he has, and are turned out to the wide world.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are they, madam?&quot; says Amy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Poor creatures,&quot; says the gentlewoman, &quot;they are out at service, nobody<br>
knows where but themselves; their case is very hard.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;though if I could find them I would assist<br>
them, yet my concern is for my boy, as I call him, and I will put him<br>
into a condition to take care of his sisters.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But, madam,&quot; says the good, compassionate creature, &quot;he may not be so<br>
charitable perhaps by his own inclination, for brothers are not<br>
fathers, and they have been cruelly used already, poor girls; we have<br>
often relieved them, both with victuals and clothes too, even while they<br>
were pretended to be kept by their barbarous aunt.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, madam,&quot; says Amy, &quot;what can I do for them? They are gone, it<br>
seems, and cannot be heard of. When I see them 'tis time enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
She pressed Amy then to oblige their brother, out of the plentiful<br>
fortune he was like to have, to do something for his sisters when he<br>
should be able.<br>
<br>
Amy spoke coldly of that still, but said she would consider of it; and<br>
so they parted for that time. They had several meetings after this, for<br>
Amy went to see her adopted son, and ordered his schooling, clothes, and<br>
other things, but enjoined them not to tell the young man anything, but<br>
that they thought the trade he was at too hard for him, and they would<br>
keep him at home a little longer, and give him some schooling to fit him<br>
for other business; and Amy appeared to him as she did before, only as<br>
one that had known his mother and had some kindness for him.<br>
<br>
Thus this matter passed on for near a twelvemonth, when it happened that<br>
one of my maid-servants having asked Amy leave (for Amy was mistress of<br>
the servants, and took and put out such as she pleased)--I say, having<br>
asked leave to go into the city to see her friends, came home crying<br>
bitterly, and in a most grievous agony she was, and continued so<br>
several days till Amy, perceiving the excess, and that the maid would<br>
certainly cry herself sick, she took an opportunity with her and<br>
examined her about it.<br>
<br>
The maid told her a long story, that she had been to see her brother,<br>
the only brother she had in the world, and that she knew he was put out<br>
apprentice to a ----; but there had come a lady in a coach to his uncle<br>
----, who had brought him up, and made him take him home again; and so<br>
the wench run on with the whole story just as 'tis told above, till she<br>
came to that part that belonged to herself. &quot;And there,&quot; says she, &quot;I<br>
had not let them know where I lived, and the lady would have taken me,<br>
and, they say, would have provided for me too, as she has done for my<br>
brother; but nobody could tell where to find me, and so I have lost it<br>
all, and all the hopes of being anything but a poor servant all my<br>
days;&quot; and then the girl fell a-crying again.<br>
<br>
Amy said, &quot;What's all this story? Who could this lady be? It must be<br>
some trick, sure.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;it was not a trick, for she had made<br>
them take her brother home from apprentice, and bought him new clothes,<br>
and put him to have more learning; and the gentlewoman said she would<br>
make him her heir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Her heir!&quot; says Amy. &quot;What does that amount to? It may be she had<br>
nothing to leave him; she might make anybody her heir.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no,&quot;' says the girl; &quot;she came in a fine coach and horses, and I<br>
don't know how many footmen to attend her, and brought a great bag of<br>
gold and gave it to my uncle ----, he that brought up my brother, to buy<br>
him clothes and to pay for his schooling and board.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;He that brought up your brother?&quot; says Amy. &quot;Why, did not he bring you<br>
up too as well as your brother? Pray who brought you up, then?&quot;<br>
<br>
Here the poor girl told a melancholy story, how an aunt had brought up<br>
her and her sister, and how barbarously she had used them, as we have<br>
heard.<br>
<br>
By this time Amy had her head full enough, and her heart too, and did<br>
not know how to hold it, or what to do, for she was satisfied that this<br>
was no other than my own daughter, for she told her all the history of<br>
her father and mother, and how she was carried by their maid to her<br>
aunt's door, just as is related in the beginning of my story.<br>
<br>
Amy did not tell me this story for a great while, nor did she well know<br>
what course to take in it; but as she had authority to manage everything<br>
in the family, she took occasion some time after, without letting me<br>
know anything of it, to find some fault with the maid and turn her away.<br>
<br>
Her reasons were good, though at first I was not pleased when I heard of<br>
it, but I was convinced afterwards that she was in the right, for if she<br>
had told me of it I should have been in great perplexity between the<br>
difficulty of concealing myself from my own child and the inconvenience<br>
of having my way of living be known among my first husband's relations,<br>
and even to my husband himself; for as to his being dead at Paris, Amy,<br>
seeing me resolved against marrying any more, had told me that she had<br>
formed that story only to make me easy when I was in Holland if anything<br>
should offer to my liking.<br>
<br>
However, I was too tender a mother still, notwithstanding what I had<br>
done, to let this poor girl go about the world drudging, as it were, for<br>
bread, and slaving at the fire and in the kitchen as a cook-maid;<br>
besides, it came into my head that she might perhaps marry some poor<br>
devil of a footman, or a coachman, or some such thing, and be undone<br>
that way, or, which was worse, be drawn in to lie with some of that<br>
coarse, cursed kind, and be with child, and be utterly ruined that way;<br>
and in the midst of all my prosperity this gave me great uneasiness.<br>
<br>
As to sending Amy to her, there was no doing that now, for, as she had<br>
been servant in the house, she knew Amy as well as Amy knew me; and no<br>
doubt, though I was much out of her sight, yet she might have had the<br>
curiosity to have peeped at me, and seen me enough to know me again if I<br>
had discovered myself to her; so that, in short, there was nothing to be<br>
done that way.<br>
<br>
However, Amy, a diligent indefatigable creature, found out another<br>
woman, and gave her her errand, and sent her to the honest man's house<br>
in Spitalfields, whither she supposed the girl would go after she was<br>
out of her place; and bade her talk with her, and tell her at a distance<br>
that as something had been done for her brother, so something would be<br>
done for her too; and, that she should not be discouraged, she carried<br>
her &pound;20 to buy her clothes, and bid her not go to service any more, but<br>
think of other things; that she should take a lodging in some good<br>
family, and that she should soon hear farther.<br>
<br>
The girl was overjoyed with this news, you may be sure, and at first a<br>
little too much elevated with it, and dressed herself very handsomely<br>
indeed, and as soon as she had done so came and paid a visit to Madam<br>
Amy, to let her see how fine she was. Amy congratulated her, and wished<br>
it might be all as she expected, but admonished her not to be elevated<br>
with it too much; told her humility was the best ornament of a<br>
gentlewoman, and a great deal of good advice she gave her, but<br>
discovered nothing.<br>
<br>
All this was acted in the first years of my setting up my new figure<br>
here in town, and while the masks and balls were in agitation; and Amy<br>
carried on the affair of setting out my son into the world, which we<br>
were assisted in by the sage advice of my faithful counsellor, Sir<br>
Robert Clayton, who procured us a master for him, by whom he was<br>
afterwards sent abroad to Italy, as you shall hear in its place; and Amy<br>
managed my daughter too very well, though by a third hand.<br>
<br>
My amour with my Lord ---- began now to draw to an end, and indeed,<br>
notwithstanding his money, it had lasted so long that I was much more<br>
sick of his lordship than he could be of me. He grew old and fretful,<br>
and captious, and I must add, which made the vice itself begin to grow<br>
surfeiting and nauseous to me, he grew worse and wickeder the older he<br>
grew, and that to such degree as is not fit to write of, and made me so<br>
weary of him that upon one of his capricious humours, which he often<br>
took occasion to trouble me with, I took occasion to be much less<br>
complaisant to him than I used to be; and as I knew him to be hasty, I<br>
first took care to put him into a little passion, and then to resent it,<br>
and this brought us to words, in which I told him I thought he grew sick<br>
of me; and he answered in a heat that truly so he was. I answered that I<br>
found his lordship was endeavouring to make me sick too; that I had met<br>
with several such rubs from him of late, and that he did not use me as<br>
he used to do, and I begged his lordship he would make himself easy.<br>
This I spoke with an air of coldness and indifference such as I knew he<br>
could not bear; but I did not downright quarrel with him and tell him I<br>
was sick of him too, and desire him to quit me, for I knew that would<br>
come of itself; besides, I had received a great deal of handsome usage<br>
from him, and I was loth to have the breach be on my side, that he might<br>
not be able to say I was ungrateful.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: THE AMOUR DRAWS TO AN END<br>
<br>
_I told him I thought he grew sick of me; and he answered in a heat that<br>
truly so he was_]<br>
<br>
But he put the occasion into my hands, for he came no more to me for two<br>
months; indeed I expected a fit of absence, for such I had had several<br>
times before, but not for above a fortnight or three weeks at most;<br>
but after I had stayed a month, which was longer than ever he kept away<br>
yet, I took a new method with him, for I was resolved now it should be<br>
in my power to continue or not, as I thought fit. At the end of a month,<br>
therefore, I removed, and took lodgings at Kensington Gravel Pits, at<br>
that part next to the road to Acton, and left nobody in my lodgings but<br>
Amy and a footman, with proper instructions how to behave when his<br>
lordship, being come to himself, should think fit to come again, which I<br>
knew he would.<br>
<br>
About the end of two months, he came in the dusk of the evening as<br>
usual. The footman answered him, and told him his lady was not at home,<br>
but there was Mrs. Amy above; so he did not order her to be called down,<br>
but went upstairs into the dining-room, and Mrs. Amy came to him. He<br>
asked where I was. &quot;My lord,&quot; said she, &quot;my mistress has been removed a<br>
good while from hence, and lives at Kensington.&quot; &quot;Ah, Mrs. Amy! how came<br>
you to be here, then?&quot; &quot;My lord,&quot; said she, &quot;we are here till the<br>
quarter-day, because the goods are not removed, and to give answers if<br>
any comes to ask for my lady.&quot; &quot;Well, and what answer are you to give to<br>
me?&quot; &quot;Indeed, my lord,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I have no particular answer to your<br>
lordship, but to tell you and everybody else where my lady lives, that<br>
they may not think she's run away.&quot; &quot;No, Mrs. Amy,&quot; says he, &quot;I don't<br>
think she's run away; but, indeed, I can't go after her so far as<br>
that.&quot; Amy said nothing to that, but made a courtesy, and said she<br>
believed I would be there again for a week or two in a little time. &quot;How<br>
little time, Mrs Amy?&quot; says my lord. &quot;She comes next Tuesday,&quot; says Amy.<br>
&quot;Very well,&quot; says my lord; &quot;I'll call and see her then;&quot; and so he went<br>
away.<br>
<br>
Accordingly I came on the Tuesday, and stayed a fortnight, but he came<br>
not; so I went back to Kensington, and after that I had very few of his<br>
lordship's visits, which I was very glad of, and in a little time after<br>
was more glad of it than I was at first, and upon a far better account<br>
too.<br>
<br>
For now I began not to be sick of his lordship only, but really I began<br>
to be sick of the vice; and as I had good leisure now to divert and<br>
enjoy myself in the world as much as it was possible for any woman to do<br>
that ever lived in it, so I found that my judgment began to prevail upon<br>
me to fix my delight upon nobler objects than I had formerly done, and<br>
the very beginning of this brought some just reflections upon me<br>
relating to things past, and to the former manner of my living; and<br>
though there was not the least hint in all this from what may be called<br>
religion or conscience, and far from anything of repentance, or anything<br>
that was akin to it, especially at first, yet the sense of things, and<br>
the knowledge I had of the world, and the vast variety of scenes that I<br>
had acted my part in, began to work upon my senses, and it came so very<br>
strong upon my mind one morning when I had been lying awake some time<br>
in my bed, as if somebody had asked me the question, What was I a whore<br>
for now? It occurred naturally upon this inquiry, that at first I<br>
yielded to the importunity of my circumstances, the misery of which the<br>
devil dismally aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I confess I had<br>
strong natural aversions to the crime at first, partly owing to a<br>
virtuous education, and partly to a sense of religion; but the devil,<br>
and that greater devil of poverty, prevailed; and the person who laid<br>
siege to me did it in such an obliging, and I may almost say<br>
irresistible, manner, all still managed by the evil spirit; for I must<br>
be allowed to believe that he has a share in all such things, if not the<br>
whole management of them. But, I say, it was carried on by that person<br>
in such an irresistible manner that, as I said when I related the fact,<br>
there was no withstanding it; these circumstances, I say, the devil<br>
managed not only to bring me to comply, but he continued them as<br>
arguments to fortify my mind against all reflection, and to keep me in<br>
that horrid course I had engaged in, as if it were honest and lawful.<br>
<br>
But not to dwell upon that now; this was a pretence, and here was<br>
something to be said, though I acknowledge it ought not to have been<br>
sufficient to me at all; but, I say, to leave that, all this was out of<br>
doors; the devil himself could not form one argument, or put one reason<br>
into my head now, that could serve for an answer--no, not so much as a<br>
pretended answer to this question, why I should be a whore now.<br>
<br>
It had for a while been a little kind of excuse to me that I was engaged<br>
with this wicked old lord, and that I could not in honour forsake him;<br>
but how foolish and absurd did it look to repeat the word &quot;honour&quot; on so<br>
vile an occasion! as if a woman should prostitute her honour in point of<br>
honour--horrid inconsistency! Honour called upon me to detest the crime<br>
and the man too, and to have resisted all the attacks which, from the<br>
beginning, had been made upon my virtue; and honour, had it been<br>
consulted, would have preserved me honest from the beginning:<br>
<br>
 &quot;For 'honesty' and 'honour' are the same.&quot;<br>
<br>
This, however, shows us with what faint excuses and with what trifles we<br>
pretend to satisfy ourselves, and suppress the attempts of conscience,<br>
in the pursuit of agreeable crime, and in the possessing those pleasures<br>
which we are loth to part with.<br>
<br>
But this objection would now serve no longer, for my lord had in some<br>
sort broke his engagements (I won't call it honour again) with me, and<br>
had so far slighted me as fairly to justify my entire quitting of him<br>
now; and so, as the objection was fully answered, the question remained<br>
still unanswered, Why am I a whore now? Nor indeed had I anything to say<br>
for myself, even to myself; I could not without blushing, as wicked as I<br>
was, answer that I loved it for the sake of the vice, and that I<br>
delighted in being a whore, as such; I say, I could not say this, even<br>
to myself, and all alone, nor indeed would it have been true. I was<br>
never able, in justice and with truth, to say I was so wicked as that;<br>
but as necessity first debauched me, and poverty made me a whore at the<br>
beginning, so excess of avarice for getting money and excess of vanity<br>
continued me in the crime, not being able to resist the flatteries of<br>
great persons; being called the finest woman in France; being caressed<br>
by a prince; and afterwards, I had pride enough to expect and folly<br>
enough to believe, though indeed without ground, by a great monarch.<br>
These were my baits, these the chains by which the devil held me bound,<br>
and by which I was indeed too fast held for any reasoning that I was<br>
then mistress of to deliver me from.<br>
<br>
But this was all over now; avarice could have no pretence. I was out of<br>
the reach of all that fate could be supposed to do to reduce me; now I<br>
was so far from poor, or the danger of it, that I had &pound;50,000 in my<br>
pocket at least; nay, I had the income of &pound;50,000, for I had &pound;2500 a<br>
year coming in upon very good land security, besides three or four<br>
thousand pounds in money, which I kept by me for ordinary occasions,<br>
and, besides, jewels, and plate, and goods which were worth near &pound;5600<br>
more; these put together, when I ruminated on it all in my thoughts, as<br>
you may be sure I did often, added weight still to the question, as<br>
above, and it sounded continually in my head, &quot;What next? What am I a<br>
whore for now?&quot;<br>
<br>
It is true this was, as I say, seldom out of my thoughts, but yet it<br>
made no impressions upon me of that kind which might be expected from a<br>
reflection of so important a nature, and which had so much of substance<br>
and seriousness in it.<br>
<br>
But, however, it was not without some little consequences, even at that<br>
time, and which gave a little turn to my way of living at first, as you<br>
shall hear in its place.<br>
<br>
But one particular thing intervened besides this which gave me some<br>
uneasiness at this time, and made way for other things that followed. I<br>
have mentioned in several little digressions the concern I had upon me<br>
for my children, and in what manner I had directed that affair; I must<br>
go on a little with that part, in order to bring the subsequent parts of<br>
my story together.<br>
<br>
My boy, the only son I had left that I had a legal right to call &quot;son,&quot;<br>
was, as I have said, rescued from the unhappy circumstances of being<br>
apprentice to a mechanic, and was brought up upon a new foot; but though<br>
this was infinitely to his advantage, yet it put him back near three<br>
years in his coming into this world; for he had been near a year at the<br>
drudgery he was first put to, and it took up two years more to form him<br>
for what he had hopes given him he should hereafter be, so that he was<br>
full nineteen years old, or rather twenty years, before he came to be<br>
put out as I intended; at the end of which time I put him to a very<br>
flourishing Italian merchant, and he again sent him to Messina, in the<br>
island of Sicily; and a little before the juncture I am now speaking of<br>
I had letters from him--that is to say, Mrs. Amy had letters from him,<br>
intimating that he was out of his time, and that he had an opportunity<br>
to be taken into an English house there, on very good terms, if his<br>
support from hence might answer what he was bid to hope for; and so<br>
begged that what would be done for him might be so ordered that he might<br>
have it for his present advancement, referring for the particulars to<br>
his master, the merchant in London, who he had been put apprentice to<br>
here; who, to cut the story short, gave such a satisfactory account of<br>
it, and of my young man, to my steady and faithful counsellor, Sir<br>
Robert Clayton, that I made no scruple to pay &pound;4000, which was &pound;1000<br>
more than he demanded, or rather proposed, that he might have<br>
encouragement to enter into the world better than he expected.<br>
<br>
His master remitted the money very faithfully to him; and finding, by<br>
Sir Robert Clayton, that the young gentleman--for so he called him--was<br>
well supported, wrote such letters on his account as gave him a credit<br>
at Messina equal in value to the money itself.<br>
<br>
I could not digest it very well that I should all this while conceal<br>
myself thus from my own child, and make all this favour due, in his<br>
opinion, to a stranger; and yet I could not find in my heart to let my<br>
son know what a mother he had, and what a life she lived; when, at the<br>
same time that he must think himself infinitely obliged to me, he must<br>
be obliged, if he was a man of virtue, to hate his mother, and abhor the<br>
way of living by which all the bounty he enjoyed was raised.<br>
<br>
This is the reason of mentioning this part of my son's story, which is<br>
otherwise no ways concerned in my history, but as it put me upon<br>
thinking how to put an end to that wicked course I was in, that my own<br>
child, when he should afterwards come to England in a good figure, and<br>
with the appearance of a merchant, should not be ashamed to own me.<br>
<br>
But there was another difficulty, which lay heavier upon me a great<br>
deal, and that was my daughter, who, as before, I had relieved by the<br>
hands of another instrument, which Amy had procured. The girl, as I have<br>
mentioned, was directed to put herself into a good garb, take lodgings,<br>
and entertain a maid to wait upon her, and to give herself some<br>
breeding--that is to say, to learn to dance, and fit herself to appear<br>
as a gentlewoman; being made to hope that she should, some time or<br>
other, find that she should be put into a condition to support her<br>
character, and to make herself amends for all her former troubles. She<br>
was only charged not to be drawn into matrimony till she was secured of<br>
a fortune that might assist to dispose of herself suitable not to what<br>
she then was, but what she was to be.<br>
<br>
The girl was too sensible of her circumstances not to give all possible<br>
satisfaction of that kind, and indeed she was mistress of too much<br>
understanding not to see how much she should be obliged to that part for<br>
her own interest.<br>
<br>
It was not long after this, but being well equipped, and in everything<br>
well set out, as she was directed, she came, as I have related above,<br>
and paid a visit to Mrs. Amy, and to tell her of her good fortune. Amy<br>
pretended to be much surprised at the alteration, and overjoyed for her<br>
sake, and began to treat her very well, entertained her handsomely, and<br>
when she would have gone away, pretended to ask my leave, and sent my<br>
coach home with her; and, in short, learning from her where she lodged,<br>
which was in the city, Amy promised to return her visit, and did so;<br>
and, in a word, Amy and Susan (for she was my own name) began an<br>
intimate acquaintance together.<br>
<br>
There was an inexpressible difficulty in the poor girl's way, or else I<br>
should not have been able to have forborne discovering myself to her,<br>
and this was, her having been a servant in my particular family; and I<br>
could by no means think of ever letting the children know what a kind of<br>
creature they owed their being to, or giving them an occasion to upbraid<br>
their mother with her scandalous life, much less to justify the like<br>
practice from my example.<br>
<br>
Thus it was with me; and thus, no doubt, considering parents always find<br>
it that their own children are a restraint to them in their worst<br>
courses, when the sense of a superior power has not the same influence.<br>
But of that hereafter.<br>
<br>
There happened, however, one good circumstance in the case of this poor<br>
girl, which brought about a discovery sooner than otherwise it would<br>
have been, and it was thus. After she and Amy had been intimate for some<br>
time, and had exchanged several visits, the girl, now grown a woman,<br>
talking to Amy of the gay things that used to fall out when she was<br>
servant in my family, spoke of it with a kind of concern that she could<br>
not see (me) her lady; and at last she adds, &quot;'Twas very strange,<br>
madam,&quot; says she to Amy, &quot;but though I lived near two years in the<br>
house, I never saw my mistress in my life, except it was that public<br>
night when she danced in the fine Turkish habit, and then she was so<br>
disguised that I knew nothing of her afterwards.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy was glad to hear this, but as she was a cunning girl from the<br>
beginning, she was not to be bit, and so she laid no stress upon that at<br>
first, but gave me an account of it; and I must confess it gave me a<br>
secret joy to think that I was not known to her, and that, by virtue of<br>
that only accident, I might, when other circumstances made room for it,<br>
discover myself to her, and let her know she had a mother in a condition<br>
fit to be owned.<br>
<br>
It was a dreadful restraint to me before, and this gave me some very sad<br>
reflections, and made way for the great question I have mentioned above;<br>
and by how much the circumstance was bitter to me, by so much the more<br>
agreeable it was to understand that the girl had never seen me, and<br>
consequently did not know me again if she was to be told who I was.<br>
<br>
However, the next time she came to visit Amy, I was resolved to put it<br>
to a trial, and to come into the room and let her see me, and to see by<br>
that whether she knew me or not; but Amy put me by, lest indeed, as<br>
there was reason enough to question, I should not be able to contain or<br>
forbear discovering myself to her; so it went off for that time.<br>
<br>
But both these circumstances, and that is the reason of mentioning them,<br>
brought me to consider of the life I lived, and to resolve to put myself<br>
into some figure of life in which I might not be scandalous to my own<br>
family, and be afraid to make myself known to my own children, who were<br>
my own flesh and blood.<br>
<br>
There was another daughter I had, which, with all our inquiries, we<br>
could not hear of, high nor low, for several years after the first. But<br>
I return to my own story.<br>
<br>
Being now in part removed from my old station, I seemed to be in a fair<br>
way of retiring from my old acquaintances, and consequently from the<br>
vile, abominable trade I had driven so long; so that the door seemed to<br>
be, as it were, particularly open to my reformation, if I had any mind<br>
to it in earnest; but, for all that, some of my old friends, as I had<br>
used to call them, inquired me out, and came to visit me at Kensington,<br>
and that more frequently than I wished they would do; but it being once<br>
known where I was, there was no avoiding it, unless I would have<br>
downright refused and affronted them; and I was not yet in earnest<br>
enough with my resolutions to go that length.<br>
<br>
The best of it was, my old lewd favourite, who I now heartily hated,<br>
entirely dropped me. He came once to visit me, but I caused Amy to deny<br>
me, and say I was gone out. She did it so oddly, too, that when his<br>
lordship went away, he said coldly to her, &quot;Well, well, Mrs. Amy, I find<br>
your mistress does not desire to be seen; tell her I won't trouble her<br>
any more,&quot; repeating the words &quot;any more&quot; two or three times over, just<br>
at his going away.<br>
<br>
I reflected a little on it at first as unkind to him, having had so many<br>
considerable presents from him, but, as I have said, I was sick of him,<br>
and that on some accounts which, if I could suffer myself to publish<br>
them, would fully justify my conduct. But that part of the story will<br>
not bear telling, so I must leave it, and proceed.<br>
<br>
I had begun a little, as I have said above, to reflect upon my manner of<br>
living, and to think of putting a new face upon it, and nothing moved me<br>
to it more than the consideration of my having three children, who were<br>
now grown up; and yet that while I was in that station of life I could<br>
not converse with them or make myself known to them; and this gave me a<br>
great deal of uneasiness. At last I entered into talk on this part of it<br>
with my woman Amy.<br>
<br>
We lived at Kensington, as I have said, and though I had done with my<br>
old wicked l----, as above, yet I was frequently visited, as I said, by<br>
some others; so that, in a word, I began to be known in the town, not by<br>
name only, but by my character too, which was worse.<br>
<br>
It was one morning when Amy was in bed with me, and I had some of my<br>
dullest thoughts about me, that Amy, hearing me sigh pretty often, asked<br>
me if I was not well. &quot;Yes, Amy, I am well enough,&quot; says I, &quot;but my mind<br>
is oppressed with heavy thoughts, and has been so a good while;&quot; and<br>
then I told her how it grieved me that I could not make myself known to<br>
my own children, or form any acquaintances in the world. &quot;Why so?&quot; says<br>
Amy. &quot;Why, prithee, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;what will my children say to<br>
themselves, and to one another, when they find their mother, however<br>
rich she may be, is at best but a whore, a common whore? And as for<br>
acquaintance, prithee, Amy, what sober lady or what family of any<br>
character will visit or be acquainted with a whore?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, all that's true, madam,&quot; says Amy; &quot;but how can it be remedied<br>
now?&quot; &quot;'Tis true, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;the thing cannot be remedied now, but<br>
the scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Truly,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I do not see how, unless you will go abroad again,<br>
and live in some other nation where nobody has known us or seen us, so<br>
that they cannot say they ever saw us before.&quot;<br>
<br>
That very thought of Amy put what follows into my head, and I returned,<br>
&quot;Why, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;is it not possible for me to shift my being from<br>
this part of the town and go and live in another part of the city, or<br>
another part of the country, and be as entirely concealed as if I had<br>
never been known?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I believe it might; but then you must put off all your<br>
equipages and servants, coaches and horses, change your liveries--nay,<br>
your own clothes, and, if it was possible, your very face.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;and that's the way, Amy, and that I'll do, and that<br>
forthwith; for I am not able to live in this manner any longer.&quot; Amy<br>
came into this with a kind of pleasure particular to herself--that is to<br>
say, with an eagerness not to be resisted; for Amy was apt to be<br>
precipitant in her motions, and was for doing it immediately. &quot;Well,&quot;<br>
says I, &quot;Amy, as soon as you will; but what course must we take to do<br>
it? We cannot put off servants, and coach and horses, and everything,<br>
leave off housekeeping, and transform ourselves into a new shape all in<br>
a moment; servants must have warning, and the goods must be sold off,<br>
and a thousand things;&quot; and this began to perplex us, and in particular<br>
took us up two or three days' consideration.<br>
<br>
At last Amy, who was a clever manager in such cases, came to me with a<br>
scheme, as she called it. &quot;I have found it out, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;I<br>
have found a scheme how you shall, if you have a mind to it, begin and<br>
finish a perfect entire change of your figure and circumstances in one<br>
day, and shall be as much unknown, madam, in twenty-four hours, as you<br>
would be in so many years.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;let us hear of it, for you please me mightily with<br>
the thoughts of it.&quot; &quot;Why, then,&quot; says Amy, &quot;let me go into the city<br>
this afternoon, and I'll inquire out some honest, plain sober family,<br>
where I will take lodgings for you, as for a country gentlewoman that<br>
desires to be in London for about half a year, and to board yourself and<br>
a kinswoman--that is, half a servant, half a companion, meaning myself;<br>
and so agree with them by the month. To this lodging (if I hit upon one<br>
to your mind) you may go to-morrow morning in a hackney-coach, with<br>
nobody but me, and leave such clothes and linen as you think fit, but,<br>
to be sure, the plainest you have; and then you are removed at once; you<br>
never need set your foot in this house again&quot; (meaning where we then<br>
were), &quot;or see anybody belonging to it. In the meantime I'll let the<br>
servants know that you are going over to Holland upon extraordinary<br>
business, and will leave off your equipages, and so I'll give them<br>
warning, or, if they will accept of it, give them a month's wages. Then<br>
I'll sell off your furniture as well as I can. As to your coach, it is<br>
but having it new painted and the lining changed, and getting new<br>
harness and hammercloths, and you may keep it still or dispose of it as<br>
you think fit. And only take care to let this lodging be in some remote<br>
part of the town, and you may be as perfectly unknown as if you had<br>
never been in England in your life.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was Amy's scheme, and it pleased me so well that I resolved not<br>
only to let her go, but was resolved to go with her myself; but Amy put<br>
me off of that, because, she said, she should have occasion to hurry up<br>
and down so long that if I was with her it would rather hinder than<br>
further her, so I waived it.<br>
<br>
In a word, Amy went, and was gone five long hours; but when she came<br>
back I could see by her countenance that her success had been suitable<br>
to her pains, for she came laughing and gaping. &quot;O madam!&quot; says she, &quot;I<br>
have pleased you to the life;&quot; and with that she tells me how she had<br>
fixed upon a house in a court in the Minories; that she was directed to<br>
it merely by accident; that it was a female family, the master of the<br>
house being gone to New England, and that the woman had four children,<br>
kept two maids, and lived very handsomely, but wanted company to divert<br>
her; and that on that very account she had agreed to take boarders.<br>
<br>
Amy agreed for a good, handsome price, because she was resolved I should<br>
be used well; so she bargained to give her &pound;35 for the half-year, and<br>
&pound;50 if we took a maid, leaving that to my choice; and that we might be<br>
satisfied we should meet with nothing very gay, the people were Quakers,<br>
and I liked them the better.<br>
<br>
I was so pleased that I resolved to go with Amy the next day to see the<br>
lodgings, and to see the woman of the house, and see how I liked them;<br>
but if I was pleased with the general, I was much more pleased with the<br>
particulars, for the gentlewoman--I must call her so, though she was a<br>
Quaker--was a most courteous, obliging, mannerly person, perfectly<br>
well-bred and perfectly well-humoured, and, in short, the most agreeable<br>
conversation that ever I met with; and, which was worth all, so grave,<br>
and yet so pleasant and so merry, that 'tis scarcely possible for me to<br>
express how I was pleased and delighted with her company; and<br>
particularly, I was so pleased that I would go away no more; so I e'en<br>
took up my lodging there the very first night.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, though it took up Amy almost a month so entirely to put<br>
off all the appearances of housekeeping, as above, it need take me up no<br>
time to relate it; 'tis enough to say that Amy quitted all that part of<br>
the world and came pack and package to me, and here we took up our<br>
abode.<br>
<br>
I was now in a perfect retreat indeed, remote from the eyes of all that<br>
ever had seen me, and as much out of the way of being ever seen or heard<br>
of by any of the gang that used to follow me as if I had been among the<br>
mountains in Lancashire; for when did a blue garter or a coach-and-six<br>
come into a little narrow passage in the Minories or Goodman's Fields?<br>
And as there was no fear of them, so really I had no desire to see them,<br>
or so much as to hear from them any more as long as I lived.<br>
<br>
I seemed in a little hurry while Amy came and went so every day at<br>
first, but when that was over I lived here perfectly retired, and with a<br>
most pleasant and agreeable lady; I must call her so, for, though a<br>
Quaker, she had a full share of good breeding, sufficient to her if she<br>
had been a duchess; in a word, she was the most agreeable creature in<br>
her conversation, as I said before, that ever I met with.<br>
<br>
I pretended, after I had been there some time, to be extremely in love<br>
with the dress of the Quakers, and this pleased her so much that she<br>
would needs dress me up one day in a suit of her own clothes; but my<br>
real design was to see whether it would pass upon me for a disguise.<br>
<br>
Amy was struck with the novelty, though I had not mentioned my design to<br>
her, and when the Quaker was gone out of the room says Amy, &quot;I guess<br>
your meaning; it is a perfect disguise to you. Why, you look quite<br>
another body; I should not have known you myself. Nay,&quot; says Amy, &quot;more<br>
than that, it makes you look ten years younger than you did.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing could please me better than that, and when Amy repeated it, I<br>
was so fond of it that I asked my Quaker (I won't call her landlady;<br>
'tis indeed too coarse a word for her, and she deserved a much<br>
better)--I say, I asked her if she would sell it. I told her I was so<br>
fond of it that I would give her enough to buy her a better suit. She<br>
declined it at first, but I soon perceived that it was chiefly in good<br>
manners, because I should not dishonour myself, as she called it, to put<br>
on her old clothes; but if I pleased to accept of them, she would give<br>
me them for my dressing-clothes, and go with me, and buy a suit for me<br>
that might be better worth my wearing.<br>
<br>
But as I conversed in a very frank, open manner with her, I bid her do<br>
the like with me; that I made no scruples of such things, but that if<br>
she would let me have them I would satisfy her. So she let me know what<br>
they cost, and to make her amends I gave her three guineas more than<br>
they cost her.<br>
<br>
This good (though unhappy) Quaker had the misfortune to have had a bad<br>
husband, and he was gone beyond sea. She had a good house, and well<br>
furnished, and had some jointure of her own estate which supported her<br>
and her children, so that she did not want; but she was not at all above<br>
such a help as my being there was to her; so she was as glad of me as I<br>
was of her.<br>
<br>
However, as I knew there was no way to fix this new acquaintance like<br>
making myself a friend to her, I began with making her some handsome<br>
presents and the like to her children. And first, opening my bundles one<br>
day in my chamber, I heard her in another room, and called her in with a<br>
kind of familiar way. There I showed her some of my fine clothes, and<br>
having among the rest of my things a piece of very fine new holland,<br>
which I had bought a little before, worth about 9s. an ell, I pulled it<br>
out: &quot;Here, my friend,&quot; says I, &quot;I will make you a present, if you will<br>
accept of it;&quot; and with that I laid the piece of Holland in her lap.<br>
<br>
I could see she was surprised, and that she could hardly speak. &quot;What<br>
dost thou mean?&quot; says she. &quot;Indeed I cannot have the face to accept so<br>
fine a present as this;&quot; adding, &quot;'Tis fit for thy own use, but 'tis<br>
above my wear, indeed.&quot; I thought she had meant she must not wear it so<br>
fine because she was a Quaker. So I returned, &quot;Why, do not you Quakers<br>
wear fine linen neither?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says she, &quot;we wear fine linen when we<br>
can afford it, but this is too good for me.&quot; However, I made her take<br>
it, and she was very thankful too. But my end was answered another way,<br>
for by this I engaged her so, that as I found her a woman of<br>
understanding, and of honesty too, I might, upon any occasion, have a<br>
confidence in her, which was, indeed, what I very much wanted.<br>
<br>
By accustoming myself to converse with her, I had not only learned to<br>
dress like a Quaker, but so used myself to &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; that I<br>
talked like a Quaker too, as readily and naturally as if I had been born<br>
among them; and, in a word, I passed for a Quaker among all people that<br>
did not know me. I went but little abroad, but I had been so used to a<br>
coach that I knew not how well to go without one; besides, I thought it<br>
would be a farther disguise to me, so I told my Quaker friend one day<br>
that I thought I lived too close, that I wanted air. She proposed<br>
taking a hackney-coach sometimes, or a boat; but I told her I had always<br>
had a coach of my own till now, and I could find in my heart to have one<br>
again.<br>
<br>
She seemed to think it strange at first, considering how close I lived,<br>
but had nothing to say when she found I did not value the expense; so,<br>
in short, I resolved I would have a coach. When we came to talk of<br>
equipages, she extolled the having all things plain. I said so too; so I<br>
left it to her direction, and a coachmaker was sent for, and he provided<br>
me a plain coach, no gilding or painting, lined with a light grey cloth,<br>
and my coachman had a coat of the same, and no lace on his hat.<br>
<br>
When all was ready I dressed myself in the dress I bought of her, and<br>
said, &quot;Come, I'll be a Quaker to-day, and you and I'll go abroad;&quot; which<br>
we did, and there was not a Quaker in the town looked less like a<br>
counterfeit than I did. But all this was my particular plot, to be the<br>
more completely concealed, and that I might depend upon being not known,<br>
and yet need not be confined like a prisoner and be always in fear; so<br>
that all the rest was grimace.<br>
<br>
We lived here very easy and quiet, and yet I cannot say I was so in my<br>
mind; I was like a fish out of water. I was as gay and as young in my<br>
disposition as I was at five-and-twenty; and as I had always been<br>
courted, flattered, and used to love it, so I missed it in my<br>
conversation; and this put me many times upon looking back upon things<br>
past.<br>
<br>
I had very few moments in my life which, in their reflection, afforded<br>
me anything but regret: but of all the foolish actions I had to look<br>
back upon in my life, none looked so preposterous and so like<br>
distraction, nor left so much melancholy on my mind, as my parting with<br>
my friend, the merchant of Paris, and the refusing him upon such<br>
honourable and just conditions as he had offered; and though on his just<br>
(which I called unkind) rejecting my invitation to come to him again, I<br>
had looked on him with some disgust, yet now my mind run upon him<br>
continually, and the ridiculous conduct of my refusing him, and I could<br>
never be satisfied about him. I flattered myself that if I could but see<br>
him I could yet master him, and that he would presently forget all that<br>
had passed that might be thought unkind; but as there was no room to<br>
imagine anything like that to be possible, I threw those thoughts off<br>
again as much as I could.<br>
<br>
However, they continually returned, and I had no rest night or day for<br>
thinking of him, who I had forgot above eleven years. I told Amy of it,<br>
and we talked it over sometimes in bed, almost whole nights together. At<br>
last Amy started a thing of her own head, which put it in a way of<br>
management, though a wild one too. &quot;You are so uneasy, madam,&quot; says she,<br>
&quot;about this Mr. ----, the merchant at Paris; come,&quot; says she, &quot;if you'll<br>
give me leave, I'll go over and see what's become of him.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not for ten thousand pounds,&quot; said I; &quot;no, nor if you met him in the<br>
street, not to offer to speak to him on my account.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says Amy, &quot;I<br>
would not speak to him at all; or if I did, I warrant you it shall not<br>
look to be upon your account. I'll only inquire after him, and if he is<br>
in being, you shall hear of him; if not, you shall hear of him still,<br>
and that may be enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why,&quot; says I, &quot;if you will promise me not to enter into anything<br>
relating to me with him, nor to begin any discourse at all unless he<br>
begins it with you, I could almost be persuaded to let you go and try.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy promised me all that I desired; and, in a word, to cut the story<br>
short, I let her go, but tied her up to so many particulars that it was<br>
almost impossible her going could signify anything; and had she intended<br>
to observe them, she might as well have stayed at home as have gone, for<br>
I charged her, if she came to see him, she should not so much as take<br>
notice that she knew him again; and if he spoke to her, she should tell<br>
him she was come away from me a great many years ago, and knew nothing<br>
what was become of me; that she had been come over to France six years<br>
ago, and was married there, and lived at Calais; or to that purpose.<br>
<br>
Amy promised me nothing, indeed; for, as she said, it was impossible for<br>
her to resolve what would be fit to do, or not to do, till she was there<br>
upon the spot, and had found out the gentleman, or heard of him; but<br>
that then, if I would trust her, as I had always done, she would answer<br>
for it that she would do nothing but what should be for my interest,<br>
and what she would hope I should be very well pleased with.<br>
<br>
With this general commission, Amy, notwithstanding she had been so<br>
frighted at the sea, ventured her carcass once more by water, and away<br>
she goes to France. She had four articles of confidence in charge to<br>
inquire after for me, and, as I found by her, she had one for herself--I<br>
say, four for me, because, though her first and principal errand was to<br>
inform myself of my Dutch merchant, yet I gave her in charge to inquire,<br>
second, after my husband, who I left a trooper in the _gens d'armes_;<br>
third, after that rogue of a Jew, whose very name I hated, and of whose<br>
face I had such a frightful idea that Satan himself could not<br>
counterfeit a worse; and, lastly, after my foreign prince. And she<br>
discharged herself very well of them all, though not so successful as I<br>
wished.<br>
<br>
Amy had a very good passage over the sea, and I had a letter from her,<br>
from Calais, in three days after she went from London. When she came to<br>
Paris she wrote me an account, that as to her first and most important<br>
inquiry, which was after the Dutch merchant, her account was, that he<br>
had returned to Paris, lived three years there, and quitting that city,<br>
went to live at Rouen; so away goes Amy for Rouen.<br>
<br>
But as she was going to bespeak a place in the coach to Rouen, she meets<br>
very accidentally in the street with her gentleman, as I called<br>
him--that is to say, the Prince de ----'s gentleman, who had been her<br>
favourite, as above.<br>
<br>
You may be sure there were several other kind things happened between<br>
Amy and him, as you shall hear afterwards; but the two main things were,<br>
first, that Amy inquired about his lord, and had a full account of him,<br>
of which presently; and, in the next place, telling him whither she was<br>
going and for what, he bade her not go yet, for that he would have a<br>
particular account of it the next day from a merchant that knew him;<br>
and, accordingly, he brought her word the next day that he had been for<br>
six years before that gone for Holland, and that he lived there still.<br>
<br>
This, I say, was the first news from Amy for some time--I mean about my<br>
merchant. In the meantime Amy, as I have said, inquired about the other<br>
persons she had in her instructions. As for the prince, the gentleman<br>
told her he was gone into Germany, where his estate lay, and that he<br>
lived there; that he had made great inquiry after me; that he (his<br>
gentleman) had made all the search he had been able for me, but that he<br>
could not hear of me; that he believed, if his lord had known I had been<br>
in England, he would have gone over to me; but that, after long inquiry,<br>
he was obliged to give it over; but that he verily believed, if he could<br>
have found me, he would have married me; and that he was extremely<br>
concerned that he could hear nothing of me.<br>
<br>
I was not at all satisfied with Amy's account, but ordered her to go to<br>
Rouen herself, which she did, and there with much difficulty (the<br>
person she was directed to being dead)--I say, with much difficulty she<br>
came to be informed that my merchant had lived there two years, or<br>
something more, but that, having met with a very great misfortune, he<br>
had gone back to Holland, as the French merchant said, where he had<br>
stayed two years; but with this addition, viz., that he came back again<br>
to Rouen, and lived in good reputation there another year; and<br>
afterwards he was gone to England, and that he lived in London. But Amy<br>
could by no means learn how to write to him there, till, by great<br>
accident, an old Dutch skipper, who had formerly served him, coming to<br>
Rouen, Amy was told of it; and he told her that he lodged in St.<br>
Laurence Pountney's Lane, in London, but was to be seen every day upon<br>
the Exchange, in the French walk.<br>
<br>
This, Amy thought, it was time enough to tell me of when she came over;<br>
and, besides, she did not find this Dutch skipper till she had spent<br>
four or five months and been again in Paris, and then come back to Rouen<br>
for farther information. But in the meantime she wrote to me from Paris<br>
that he was not to be found by any means; that he had been gone from<br>
Paris seven or eight years; that she was told he had lived at Rouen, and<br>
she was agoing thither to inquire, but that she had heard afterwards<br>
that he was gone also from thence to Holland, so she did not go.<br>
<br>
This, I say, was Amy's first account; and I, not satisfied with it, had<br>
sent her an order to go to Rouen to inquire there also, as above.<br>
<br>
While this was negotiating, and I received these accounts from Amy at<br>
several times, a strange adventure happened to me which I must mention<br>
just here. I had been abroad to take the air as usual with my Quaker, as<br>
far as Epping Forest, and we were driving back towards London, when, on<br>
the road between Bow and Mile End, two gentlemen on horseback came<br>
riding by, having overtaken the coach and passed it, and went forwards<br>
towards London.<br>
<br>
They did not ride apace though they passed the coach, for we went very<br>
softly; nor did they look into the coach at all, but rode side by side,<br>
earnestly talking to one another and inclining their faces sideways a<br>
little towards one another, he that went nearest the coach with his face<br>
from it, and he that was farthest from the coach with his face towards<br>
it, and passing in the very next tract to the coach, I could hear them<br>
talk Dutch very distinctly. But it is impossible to describe the<br>
confusion I was in when I plainly saw that the farthest of the two, him<br>
whose face looked towards the coach, was my friend the Dutch merchant of<br>
Paris.<br>
<br>
If it had been possible to conceal my disorder from my friend the Quaker<br>
I would have done it, but I found she was too well acquainted with such<br>
things not to take the hint. &quot;Dost thou understand Dutch?&quot; said she.<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; said I. &quot;Why,&quot; says she, &quot;it is easy to suppose that thou art a<br>
little concerned at somewhat those men say; I suppose they are talking<br>
of thee.&quot; &quot;Indeed, my good friend,&quot; said I, &quot;thou art mistaken this<br>
time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but 'tis all about<br>
ships and trading affairs.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says she, &quot;then one of them is a man<br>
friend of thine, or somewhat is the case; for though thy tongue will not<br>
confess it, thy face does.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was going to have told a bold lie, and said I knew nothing of them;<br>
but I found it was impossible to conceal it, so I said, &quot;Indeed, I think<br>
I know the farthest of them; but I have neither spoken to him or so much<br>
as seen him for about eleven years.&quot; &quot;Well, then,&quot; says she, &quot;thou hast<br>
seen him with more than common eyes when thou didst see him, or else<br>
seeing him now would not be such a surprise to thee.&quot; &quot;Indeed,&quot; said I,<br>
&quot;it is true I am a little surprised at seeing him just now, for I<br>
thought he had been in quite another part of the world; and I can assure<br>
you I never saw him in England in my life.&quot; &quot;Well, then, it is the more<br>
likely he is come over now on purpose to seek thee.&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; said I,<br>
&quot;knight-errantry is over; women are not so hard to come at that men<br>
should not be able to please themselves without running from one kingdom<br>
to another.&quot; &quot;Well, well,&quot; says she, &quot;I would have him see thee for all<br>
that, as plainly as thou hast seen him.&quot; &quot;No, but he shan't,&quot; says I,<br>
&quot;for I am sure he don't know me in this dress, and I'll take care he<br>
shan't see my face, if I can help it;&quot; so I held up my fan before my<br>
face, and she saw me resolute in that, so she pressed me no farther.<br>
<br>
We had several discourses upon the subject, but still I let her know I<br>
was resolved he should not know me; but at last I confessed so much,<br>
that though I would not let him know who I was or where I lived, I did<br>
not care if I knew where he lived and how I might inquire about him. She<br>
took the hint immediately, and her servant being behind the coach, she<br>
called him to the coach-side and bade him keep his eye upon that<br>
gentleman, and as soon as the coach came to the end of Whitechapel he<br>
should get down and follow him closely, so as to see where he put up his<br>
horse, and then to go into the inn and inquire, if he could, who he was<br>
and where he lived.<br>
<br>
The fellow followed diligently to the gate of an inn in Bishopsgate<br>
Street, and seeing him go in, made no doubt but he had him fast; but was<br>
confounded when, upon inquiry, he found the inn was a thoroughfare into<br>
another street, and that the two gentlemen had only rode through the<br>
inn, as the way to the street where they were going; and so, in short,<br>
came back no wiser than he went.<br>
<br>
My kind Quaker was more vexed at the disappointment, at least apparently<br>
so, than I was; and asking the fellow if he was sure he knew the<br>
gentleman again if he saw him, the fellow said he had followed him so<br>
close and took so much notice of him, in order to do his errand as it<br>
ought to be done, that he was very sure he should know him again; and<br>
that, besides, he was sure he should know his horse.<br>
<br>
This part was, indeed, likely enough; and the kind Quaker, without<br>
telling me anything of the matter, caused her man to place himself just<br>
at the corner of Whitechapel Church wall every Saturday in the<br>
afternoon, that being the day when the citizens chiefly ride abroad to<br>
take the air, and there to watch all the afternoon and look for him.<br>
<br>
It was not till the fifth Saturday that her man came, with a great deal<br>
of joy, and gave her an account that he had found out the gentleman;<br>
that he was a Dutchman, but a French merchant; that he came from Rouen,<br>
and his name was ----, and that he lodged at Mr. ----'s, on Laurence<br>
Pountney's Hill. I was surprised, you may be sure, when she came and<br>
told me one evening all the particulars, except that of having set her<br>
man to watch. &quot;I have found out thy Dutch friend,&quot; says she, &quot;and can<br>
tell thee how to find him too.&quot; I coloured again as red as fire. &quot;Then<br>
thou hast dealt with the evil one, friend,&quot; said I very gravely. &quot;No,<br>
no,&quot; says she, &quot;I have no familiar; but I tell thee I have found him for<br>
thee, and his name is So-and-so, and he lives as above recited.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was surprised again at this, not being able to imagine how she should<br>
come to know all this. However, to put me out of pain, she told me what<br>
she had done. &quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;thou art very kind, but this is not<br>
worth thy pains; for now I know it, 'tis only to satisfy my curiosity;<br>
for I shall not send to him upon any account.&quot; &quot;Be that as thou wilt,&quot;<br>
says she. &quot;Besides,&quot; added she, &quot;thou art in the right to say so to me,<br>
for why should I be trusted with it? Though, if I were, I assure thee I<br>
should not betray thee.&quot; &quot;That's very kind,&quot; said I, &quot;and I believe<br>
thee; and assure thyself, if I do send to him, thou shalt know it, and<br>
be trusted with it too.&quot;<br>
<br>
During this interval of five weeks I suffered a hundred thousand<br>
perplexities of mind. I was thoroughly convinced I was right as to the<br>
person, that it was the man. I knew him so well, and saw him so plain, I<br>
could not be deceived. I drove out again in the coach (on pretence of<br>
air) almost every day in hopes of seeing him again, but was never so<br>
lucky as to see him; and now I had made the discovery I was as far to<br>
seek what measures to take as I was before.<br>
<br>
To send to him, or speak to him first if I should see him, so as to be<br>
known to him, that I resolved not to do, if I died for it. To watch him<br>
about his lodging, that was as much below my spirit as the other. So<br>
that, in a word, I was at a perfect loss how to act or what to do.<br>
<br>
At length came Amy's letter, with the last account which she had at<br>
Rouen from the Dutch skipper, which, confirming the other, left me out<br>
of doubt that this was my man; but still no human invention could bring<br>
me to the speech of him in such a manner as would suit with my<br>
resolutions. For, after all, how did I know what his circumstances were?<br>
whether married or single? And if he had a wife, I knew he was so honest<br>
a man he would not so much as converse with me, or so much as know me if<br>
he met me in the street.<br>
<br>
In the next place, as he entirely neglected me, which, in short, is the<br>
worst way of slighting a woman, and had given no answer to my letters, I<br>
did not know but he might be the same man still; so I resolved that I<br>
could do nothing in it unless some fairer opportunity presented, which<br>
might make my way clearer to me; for I was determined he should have no<br>
room to put any more slights upon me.<br>
<br>
In these thoughts I passed away near three months; till at last, being<br>
impatient, I resolved to send for Amy to come over, and tell her how<br>
things stood, and that I would do nothing till she came. Amy, in answer,<br>
sent me word she would come away with all speed, but begged of me that I<br>
would enter into no engagement with him, or anybody, till she arrived;<br>
but still keeping me in the dark as to the thing itself which she had to<br>
say; at which I was heartily vexed, for many reasons.<br>
<br>
But while all these things were transacting, and letters and answers<br>
passed between Amy and I a little slower than usual, at which I was not<br>
so well pleased as I used to be with Amy's despatch--I say, in this time<br>
the following scene opened.<br>
<br>
It was one afternoon, about four o'clock, my friendly Quaker and I<br>
sitting in her chamber upstairs, and very cheerful, chatting together<br>
(for she was the best company in the world), when somebody ringing<br>
hastily at the door, and no servant just then in the way, she ran down<br>
herself to the door, when a gentleman appears, with a footman attending,<br>
and making some apologies, which she did not thoroughly understand, he<br>
speaking but broken English, he asked to speak with me, by the very same<br>
name that I went by in her house, which, by the way, was not the name<br>
that he had known me by.<br>
<br>
She, with very civil language, in her way, brought him into a very<br>
handsome parlour below stairs, and said she would go and see whether the<br>
person who lodged in her house owned that name, and he should hear<br>
farther.<br>
<br>
I was a little surprised, even before I knew anything of who it was, my<br>
mind foreboding the thing as it happened (whence that arises let the<br>
naturalists explain to us); but I was frighted and ready to die when my<br>
Quaker came up all gay and crowing. &quot;There,&quot; says she, &quot;is the Dutch<br>
French merchant come to see thee.&quot; I could not speak one word to her nor<br>
stir off of my chair, but sat as motionless as a statue. She talked a<br>
thousand pleasant things to me, but they made no impression on me. At<br>
last she pulled me and teased me. &quot;Come, come,&quot; says she, &quot;be thyself,<br>
and rouse up. I must go down again to him; what shall I say to him?&quot;<br>
&quot;Say,&quot; said I, &quot;that you have no such body in the house.&quot; &quot;That I<br>
cannot do,&quot; says she, &quot;because it is not the truth. Besides, I have<br>
owned thou art above. Come, come, go down with me.&quot; &quot;Not for a thousand<br>
guineas,&quot; said I. &quot;Well,&quot; says she, &quot;I'll go and tell him thou wilt come<br>
quickly.&quot; So, without giving me time to answer her, away she goes.<br>
<br>
A million of thoughts circulated in my head while she was gone, and what<br>
to do I could not tell; I saw no remedy but I must speak with him, but<br>
would have given &pound;500 to have shunned it; yet had I shunned it, perhaps<br>
then I would have given &pound;500 again that I had seen him. Thus fluctuating<br>
and unconcluding were my thoughts, what I so earnestly desired I<br>
declined when it offered itself; and what now I pretended to decline was<br>
nothing but what I had been at the expense of &pound;40 or &pound;50 to send Amy to<br>
France for, and even without any view, or, indeed, any rational<br>
expectation of bringing it to pass; and what for half a year before I<br>
was so uneasy about that I could not be quiet night or day till Amy<br>
proposed to go over to inquire after him. In short, my thoughts were all<br>
confused and in the utmost disorder. I had once refused and rejected<br>
him, and I repented it heartily; then I had taken ill his silence, and<br>
in my mind rejected him again, but had repented that too. Now I had<br>
stooped so low as to send after him into France, which if he had known,<br>
perhaps, he had never come after me; and should I reject him a third<br>
time! On the other hand, he had repented too, in his turn, perhaps, and<br>
not knowing how I had acted, either in stooping to send in search after<br>
him or in the wickeder part of my life, was come over hither to seek me<br>
again; and I might take him, perhaps, with the same advantages as I<br>
might have done before, and would I now be backward to see him! Well,<br>
while I was in this hurry my friend the Quaker comes up again, and<br>
perceiving the confusion I was in, she runs to her closet and fetched me<br>
a little pleasant cordial; but I would not taste it. &quot;Oh,&quot; says she, &quot;I<br>
understand thee. Be not uneasy; I'll give thee something shall take off<br>
all the smell of it; if he kisses thee a thousand times he shall be no<br>
wiser.&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;Thou art perfectly acquainted with affairs<br>
of this nature; I think you must govern me now;&quot; so I began to incline<br>
to go down with her. Upon that I took the cordial, and she gave me a<br>
kind of spicy preserve after it, whose flavour was so strong, and yet so<br>
deliciously pleasant, that it would cheat the nicest smelling, and it<br>
left not the least taint of the cordial on the breath.<br>
<br>
Well, after this, though with some hesitation still, I went down a pair<br>
of back-stairs with her, and into a dining-room, next to the parlour in<br>
which he was; but there I halted, and desired she would let me consider<br>
of it a little. &quot;Well, do so,&quot; says she, and left me with more readiness<br>
than she did before. &quot;Do consider, and I'll come to thee again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Though I hung back with an awkwardness that was really unfeigned, yet<br>
when she so readily left me I thought it was not so kind, and I began to<br>
think she should have pressed me still on to it; so foolishly backward<br>
are we to the thing which, of all the world, we most desire; mocking<br>
ourselves with a feigned reluctance, when the negative would be death to<br>
us. But she was too cunning for me; for while I, as it were, blamed her<br>
in my mind for not carrying me to him, though, at the same time, I<br>
appeared backward to see him, on a sudden she unlocks the folding-doors,<br>
which looked into the next parlour, and throwing them open. &quot;There,&quot;<br>
says she (ushering him in), &quot;is the person who, I suppose, thou<br>
inquirest for;&quot; and the same moment, with a kind decency, she retired,<br>
and that so swift that she would not give us leave hardly to know which<br>
way she went.<br>
<br>
I stood up, but was confounded with a sudden inquiry in my thoughts how<br>
I should receive him, and with a resolution as swift as lightning, in<br>
answer to it, said to myself, &quot;It shall be coldly.&quot; So on a sudden I put<br>
on an air of stiffness and ceremony, and held it for about two minutes;<br>
but it was with great difficulty.<br>
<br>
He restrained himself too, on the other hand, came towards me gravely,<br>
and saluted me in form; but it was, it seems, upon his supposing the<br>
Quaker was behind him, whereas she, as I said, understood things too<br>
well, and had retired as if she had vanished, that we might have full<br>
freedom; for, as she said afterwards, she supposed we had seen one<br>
another before, though it might have been a great while ago.<br>
<br>
Whatever stiffness I had put on my behaviour to him, I was surprised in<br>
my mind, and angry at his, and began to wonder what kind of a<br>
ceremonious meeting it was to be. However, after he perceived the woman<br>
was gone he made a kind of a hesitation, looking a little round him.<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; said he, &quot;I thought the gentlewoman was not withdrawn;&quot; and<br>
with that he took me in his arms and kissed me three or four times; but<br>
I, that was prejudiced to the last degree with the coldness of his first<br>
salutes, when I did not know the cause of it, could not be thoroughly<br>
cleared of the prejudice though I did know the cause, and thought that<br>
even his return, and taking me in his arms, did not seem to have the<br>
same ardour with which he used to receive me, and this made me behave to<br>
him awkwardly, and I know not how for a good while; but this by the way.<br>
<br>
He began with a kind of an ecstasy upon the subject of his finding me<br>
out; how it was possible that he should have been four years in England,<br>
and had used all the ways imaginable, and could never so much as have<br>
the least intimation of me, or of any one like me; and that it was now<br>
above two years that he had despaired of it, and had given over all<br>
inquiry; and that now he should chop upon me, as it were, unlooked and<br>
unsought for.<br>
<br>
I could easily have accounted for his not finding me if I had but set<br>
down the detail of my real retirement; but I gave it a new, and indeed a<br>
truly hypocritical turn. I told him that any one that knew the manner<br>
of life I led might account for his not finding me; that the retreat I<br>
had taken up would have rendered it a hundred thousand to one odds that<br>
he ever found me at all; that, as I had abandoned all conversation,<br>
taken up another name, lived remote from London, and had not preserved<br>
one acquaintance in it, it was no wonder he had not met with me; that<br>
even my dress would let him see that I did not desire to be known by<br>
anybody.<br>
<br>
Then he asked if I had not received some letters from him. I told him<br>
no, he had not thought fit to give me the civility of an answer to the<br>
last I wrote to him, and he could not suppose I should expect a return<br>
after a silence in a case where I had laid myself so low and exposed<br>
myself in a manner I had never been used to; that indeed I had never<br>
sent for any letters after that to the place where I had ordered his to<br>
be directed; and that, being so justly, as I thought, punished for my<br>
weakness, I had nothing to do but to repent of being a fool, after I had<br>
strictly adhered to a just principle before; that, however, as what I<br>
did was rather from motions of gratitude than from real weakness,<br>
however it might be construed by him, I had the satisfaction in myself<br>
of having fully discharged the debt. I added, that I had not wanted<br>
occasions of all the seeming advancements which the pretended felicity<br>
of a marriage life was usually set off with, and might have been what I<br>
desired not to name; but that, however low I had stooped to him, I had<br>
maintained the dignity of female liberty against all the attacks either<br>
of pride or avarice; and that I had been infinitely obliged to him for<br>
giving me an opportunity to discharge the only obligation that<br>
endangered me, without subjecting me to the consequence; and that I<br>
hoped he was satisfied I had paid the debt by offering myself to be<br>
chained, but was infinitely debtor to him another way for letting me<br>
remain free.<br>
<br>
He was so confounded at this discourse that he knew not what to say, and<br>
for a good while he stood mute indeed; but recovering himself a little,<br>
he said I run out into a discourse he hoped was over and forgotten, and<br>
he did not intend to revive it; that he knew I had not had his letters,<br>
for that, when he first came to England, he had been at the place to<br>
which they were directed, and found them all lying there but one, and<br>
that the people had not known how to deliver them; that he thought to<br>
have had a direction there how to find me, but had the mortification to<br>
be told that they did not so much as know who I was; that he was under a<br>
great disappointment; and that I ought to know, in answer to all my<br>
resentments, that he had done a long and, he hoped, a sufficient penance<br>
for the slight that I had supposed he had put upon me; that it was true<br>
(and I could not suppose any other) that upon the repulse I had given<br>
them in a case so circumstanced as his was, and after such earnest<br>
entreaties and such offers as he had made me, he went away with a mind<br>
heartily grieved and full of resentment; that he had looked back on the<br>
crime he had committed with some regret, but on the cruelty of my<br>
treatment of the poor infant I went with at that time with the utmost<br>
detestation, and that this made him unable to send an agreeable answer<br>
to me; for which reason he had sent none at all for some time; but that<br>
in about six or seven months, those resentments wearing off by the<br>
return of his affection to me and his concern in the poor child ----.<br>
There he stopped, and indeed tears stood in his eyes; while in a<br>
parenthesis he only added, and to this minute he did not know whether it<br>
was dead or alive. He then went on: Those resentments wearing off, he<br>
sent me several letters--I think he said seven or eight--but received no<br>
answer; that then his business obliging him to go to Holland, he came to<br>
England, as in his way, but found, as above, that his letters had not<br>
been called for, but that he left them at the house after paying the<br>
postage of them; and going then back to France, he was yet uneasy, and<br>
could not refrain the knight-errantry of coming to England again to seek<br>
me, though he knew neither where or of who to inquire for me, being<br>
disappointed in all his inquiries before; that he had yet taken up his<br>
residence here, firmly believing that one time or other he should meet<br>
me, or hear of me, and that some kind chance would at last throw him in<br>
my way; that he had lived thus above four years, and though his hopes<br>
were vanished, yet he had not any thoughts of removing any more in the<br>
world, unless it should be at last, as it is with other old men, he<br>
might have some inclination to go home to die in his own country, but<br>
that he had not thought of it yet; that if I would consider all these<br>
steps, I would find some reasons to forget his first resentments, and to<br>
think that penance, as he called it, which he had undergone in search of<br>
me an _amende honorable_, in reparation of the affront given to the<br>
kindness of my letter of invitation; and that we might at last make<br>
ourselves some satisfaction on both sides for the mortifications past.<br>
<br>
I confess I could not hear all this without being moved very much, and<br>
yet I continued a little stiff and formal too a good while. I told him<br>
that before I could give him any reply to the rest of his discourse I<br>
ought to give him the satisfaction of telling him that his son was<br>
alive, and that indeed, since I saw him so concerned about it, and<br>
mention it with such affection, I was sorry that I had not found out<br>
some way or other to let him know it sooner; but that I thought, after<br>
his slighting the mother, as above, he had summed up his affection to<br>
the child in the letter he had wrote to me about providing for it; and<br>
that he had, as other fathers often do, looked upon it as a birth which,<br>
being out of the way, was to be forgotten, as its beginning was to be<br>
repented of; that in providing sufficiently for it he had done more than<br>
all such fathers used to do, and might be well satisfied with it.<br>
<br>
He answered me that he should have been very glad if I had been so good<br>
but to have given him the satisfaction of knowing the poor unfortunate<br>
creature was yet alive, and he would have taken some care of it upon<br>
himself, and particularly by owning it for a legitimate child, which,<br>
where nobody had known to the contrary, would have taken off the infamy<br>
which would otherwise cleave to it, and so the child should not itself<br>
have known anything of its own disaster; but that he feared it was now<br>
too late.<br>
<br>
He added that I might see by all his conduct since that what unhappy<br>
mistake drew him into the thing at first, and that he would have been<br>
very far from doing the injury to me, or being instrumental to add _une<br>
miserable_ (that was his word) to the world, if he had not been drawn<br>
into it by the hopes he had of making me his own; but that, if it was<br>
possible to rescue the child from the consequences of its unhappy birth,<br>
he hoped I would give him leave to do it, and he would let me see that<br>
he had both means and affection still to do it; and that,<br>
notwithstanding all the misfortunes that had befallen him, nothing that<br>
belonged to him, especially by a mother he had such a concern for as he<br>
had for me, should ever want what he was in a condition to do for it.<br>
<br>
I could not hear this without being sensibly touched with it. I was<br>
ashamed that he should show that he had more real affection for the<br>
child, though he had never seen it in his life, than I that bore it, for<br>
indeed I did not love the child, nor love to see it; and though I had<br>
provided for it, yet I did it by Amy's hand, and had not seen it above<br>
twice in four years, being privately resolved that when it grew up it<br>
should not be able to call me mother.<br>
<br>
However, I told him the child was taken care of, and that he need not be<br>
anxious about it, unless he suspected that I had less affection for it<br>
than he that had never seen it in his life; that he knew what I had<br>
promised him to do for it, namely, to give it the thousand pistoles<br>
which I had offered him, and which he had declined; that I assured him I<br>
had made my will, and that I had left it &pound;5000, and the interest of it<br>
till he should come of age, if I died before that time; that I would<br>
still be as good as that to it; but if he had a mind to take it from me<br>
into his government, I would not be against it; and to satisfy him that<br>
I would perform what I said, I would cause the child to be delivered to<br>
him, and the &pound;5000 also for its support, depending upon it that he would<br>
show himself a father to it by what I saw of his affection to it now.<br>
<br>
I had observed that he had hinted two or three times in his discourse,<br>
his having had misfortunes in the world, and I was a little surprised at<br>
the expression, especially at the repeating it so often; but I took no<br>
notice of that part yet.<br>
<br>
He thanked me for my kindness to the child with a tenderness which<br>
showed the sincerity of all he had said before, and which increased the<br>
regret with which, as I said, I looked back on the little affection I<br>
had showed to the poor child. He told me he did not desire to take him<br>
from me, but so as to introduce him into the world as his own, which he<br>
could still do, having lived absent from his other children (for he had<br>
two sons and a daughter which were brought up at Nimeguen, in Holland,<br>
with a sister of his) so long that he might very well send another son<br>
of ten years old to be bred up with them, and suppose his mother to be<br>
dead or alive, as he found occasion; and that, as I had resolved to do<br>
so handsomely for the child, he would add to it something considerable,<br>
though, having had some great disappointments (repeating the words), he<br>
could not do for it as he would otherwise have done.<br>
<br>
I then thought myself obliged to take notice of his having so often<br>
mentioned his having met with disappointments. I told him I was very<br>
sorry to hear he had met with anything afflicting to him in the world;<br>
that I would not have anything belonging to me add to his loss, or<br>
weaken him in what he might do for his other children; and that I would<br>
not agree to his having the child away, though the proposal was<br>
infinitely to the child's advantage, unless he would promise me that the<br>
whole expense should be mine, and that, if he did not think &pound;5000 enough<br>
for the child, I would give it more.<br>
<br>
We had so much discourse upon this and the old affairs that it took up<br>
all our time at his first visit. I was a little importunate with him to<br>
tell me how he came to find me out, but he put it off for that time,<br>
and only obtaining my leave to visit me again, he went away; and indeed<br>
my heart was so full with what he had said already that I was glad when<br>
he went away. Sometimes I was full of tenderness and affection for him,<br>
and especially when he expressed himself so earnestly and passionately<br>
about the child; other times I was crowded with doubts about his<br>
circumstances. Sometimes I was terrified with apprehensions lest, if I<br>
should come into a close correspondence with him, he should any way come<br>
to hear what kind of life I had led at Pall Mall and in other places,<br>
and it might make me miserable afterwards; from which last thought I<br>
concluded that I had better repulse him again than receive him. All<br>
these thoughts, and many more, crowded in so fast, I say, upon me that I<br>
wanted to give vent to them and get rid of him, and was very glad when<br>
he was gone away.<br>
<br>
We had several meetings after this, in which still we had so many<br>
preliminaries to go through that we scarce ever bordered upon the main<br>
subject. Once, indeed, he said something of it, and I put it off with a<br>
kind of a jest. &quot;Alas!&quot; says I, &quot;those things are out of the question<br>
now; 'tis almost two ages since those things were talked between us,&quot;<br>
says I. &quot;You see I am grown an old woman since that.&quot; Another time he<br>
gave a little push at it again, and I laughed again. &quot;Why, what dost<br>
thou talk of?&quot; said I in a formal way. &quot;Dost thou not see I am turned<br>
Quaker? I cannot speak of those things now.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; says he, &quot;the<br>
Quakers marry as well as other people, and love one another as well.<br>
Besides,&quot; says he, &quot;the Quakers' dress does not ill become you,&quot; and so<br>
jested with me again, and so it went off for a third time. However, I<br>
began to be kind to him in process of time, as they call it, and we grew<br>
very intimate; and if the following accident had not unluckily<br>
intervened, I had certainly married him, or consented to marry him, the<br>
very next time he had asked me.<br>
<br>
I had long waited for a letter from Amy, who, it seems, was just at that<br>
time gone to Rouen the second time, to make her inquiries about him; and<br>
I received a letter from her at this unhappy juncture, which gave me the<br>
following account of my business:--<br>
<br>
I. That for my gentleman, who I had now, as I may say, in my arms, she<br>
said he had been gone from Paris, as I have hinted, having met with some<br>
great losses and misfortunes; that he had been in Holland on that very<br>
account, whither he had also carried his children; that he was after<br>
that settled for some time at Rouen; that she had been at Rouen, and<br>
found there (by a mere accident), from a Dutch skipper, that he was at<br>
London, had been there above three years; that he was to be found upon<br>
the Exchange, on the French walk; and that he lodged at St. Laurence<br>
Pountney's Lane, and the like; so Amy said she supposed I might soon<br>
find him out, but that she doubted he was poor, and not worth looking<br>
after. This she did because of the next clause, which the jade had most<br>
mind to on many accounts.<br>
<br>
II. That as to the Prince ----; that, as above, he was gone into<br>
Germany, where his estate lay; that he had quitted the French service,<br>
and lived retired; that she had seen his gentleman, who remained at<br>
Paris to solicit his arrears, &amp;c.; that he had given her an account how<br>
his lord had employed him to inquire for me and find me out, as above,<br>
and told her what pains he had taken to find me; that he had understood<br>
that I was gone to England; that he once had orders to go to England to<br>
find me; that his lord had resolved, if he could have found me, to have<br>
called me a countess, and so have married me, and have carried me into<br>
Germany with him; and that his commission was still to assure me that<br>
the prince would marry me if I would come to him, and that he would send<br>
him an account that he had found me, and did not doubt but he would have<br>
orders to come over to England to attend me in a figure suitable to my<br>
quality.<br>
<br>
Amy, an ambitious jade, who knew my weakest part--namely, that I loved<br>
great things, and that I loved to be flattered and courted--said<br>
abundance of kind things upon this occasion, which she knew were<br>
suitable to me and would prompt my vanity; and talked big of the<br>
prince's gentleman having orders to come over to me with a procuration<br>
to marry me by proxy (as princes usually do in like cases), and to<br>
furnish me with an equipage, and I know not how many fine things; but<br>
told me, withal, that she had not yet let him know that she belonged to<br>
me still, or that she knew where to find me, or to write to me; because<br>
she was willing to see the bottom of it, and whether it was a reality or<br>
a gasconade. She had indeed told him that, if he had any such<br>
commission, she would endeavour to find me out, but no more.<br>
<br>
III. For the Jew, she assured me that she had not been able to come at a<br>
certainty what was become of him, or in what part of the world he was;<br>
but that thus much she had learned from good hands, that he had<br>
committed a crime, in being concerned in a design to rob a rich banker<br>
at Paris; and that he was fled, and had not been heard of there for<br>
above six years.<br>
<br>
IV. For that of my husband, the brewer, she learned, that being<br>
commanded into the field upon an occasion of some action in Flanders, he<br>
was wounded at the battle of Mons, and died of his wounds in the<br>
Hospital of the Invalids; so there was an end of my four inquiries,<br>
which I sent her over to make.<br>
<br>
This account of the prince, and the return of his affection to me, with<br>
all the flattering great things which seemed to come along with it; and<br>
especially as they came gilded and set out by my maid Amy--I say this<br>
account of the prince came to me in a very unlucky hour, and in the very<br>
crisis of my affair.<br>
<br>
The merchant and I had entered into close conferences upon the grand<br>
affair. I had left off talking my platonics, and of my independency, and<br>
being a free woman, as before; and he having cleared up my doubts too,<br>
as to his circumstances and the misfortunes he had spoken of, I had gone<br>
so far that we had begun to consider where we should live, and in what<br>
figure, what equipage, what house, and the like.<br>
<br>
I had made some harangues upon the delightful retirement of a country<br>
life, and how we might enjoy ourselves so effectually without the<br>
encumbrances of business and the world; but all this was grimace, and<br>
purely because I was afraid to make any public appearance in the world,<br>
for fear some impertinent person of quality should chop upon me again<br>
and cry out, &quot;Roxana, Roxana, by ----!&quot; with an oath, as had been done<br>
before.<br>
<br>
My merchant, bred to business and used to converse among men of<br>
business, could hardly tell how to live without it; at least it appeared<br>
he should be like a fish out of water, uneasy and dying. But, however,<br>
he joined with me; only argued that we might live as near London as we<br>
could, that he might sometimes come to 'Change and hear how the world<br>
should go abroad, and how it fared with his friends and his children.<br>
<br>
I answered that if he chose still to embarrass himself with business, I<br>
supposed it would be more to his satisfaction to be in his own country,<br>
and where his family was so well known, and where his children also<br>
were.<br>
<br>
He smiled at the thoughts of that, and let me know that he should be<br>
very willing to embrace such an offer; but that he could not expect it<br>
of me, to whom England was, to be sure, so naturalised now as that it<br>
would be carrying me out of my native country, which he would not desire<br>
by any means, however agreeable it might be to him.<br>
<br>
I told him he was mistaken in me; that as I had told him so much of a<br>
married state being a captivity, and the family being a house of<br>
bondage, that when I married I expected to be but an upper servant; so,<br>
if I did notwithstanding submit to it, I hoped he should see I knew how<br>
to act the servant's part, and do everything to oblige my master; that<br>
if I did not resolve to go with him wherever he desired to go, he might<br>
depend I would never have him. &quot;And did I not,&quot; said I, &quot;offer myself to<br>
go with you to the East Indies?&quot;<br>
<br>
All this while this was indeed but a copy of my countenance; for, as my<br>
circumstances would not admit of my stay in London, at least not so as<br>
to appear publicly, I resolved, if I took him, to live remote in the<br>
country, or go out of England with him.<br>
<br>
But in an evil hour, just now came Amy's letter, in the very middle of<br>
all these discourses; and the fine things she had said about the prince<br>
began to make strange work with me. The notion of being a princess, and<br>
going over to live where all that had happened here would have been<br>
quite sunk out of knowledge as well as out of memory (conscience<br>
excepted), was mighty taking. The thoughts of being surrounded with<br>
domestics, honoured with titles, be called her Highness, and live in all<br>
the splendour of a court, and, which was still more, in the arms of a<br>
man of such rank, and who, I knew, loved and valued me--all this, in a<br>
word, dazzled my eyes, turned my head, and I was as truly crazed and<br>
distracted for about a fortnight as most of the people in Bedlam, though<br>
perhaps not quite so far gone.<br>
<br>
When my gentleman came to me the next time I had no notion of him; I<br>
wished I had never received him at all. In short, I resolved to have no<br>
more to say to him, so I feigned myself indisposed; and though I did<br>
come down to him and speak to him a little, yet I let him see that I was<br>
so ill that I was (as we say) no company, and that it would be kind in<br>
him to give me leave to quit him for that time.<br>
<br>
The next morning he sent a footman to inquire how I did; and I let him<br>
know I had a violent cold, and was very ill with it. Two days after he<br>
came again, and I let him see me again, but feigned myself so hoarse<br>
that I could not speak to be heard, and that it was painful to me but to<br>
whisper; and, in a word, I held him in this suspense near three weeks.<br>
<br>
During this time I had a strange elevation upon my mind; and the prince,<br>
or the spirit of him, had such a possession of me that I spent most of<br>
this time in the realising all the great things of a life with the<br>
prince, to my mind pleasing my fancy with the grandeur I was supposing<br>
myself to enjoy, and with wickedly studying in what manner to put off<br>
this gentleman and be rid of him for ever.<br>
<br>
I cannot but say that sometimes the baseness of the action stuck hard<br>
with me; the honour and sincerity with which he had always treated me,<br>
and, above all, the fidelity he had showed me at Paris, and that I owed<br>
my life to him--I say, all these stared in my face, and I frequently<br>
argued with myself upon the obligation I was under to him, and how base<br>
would it be now too, after so many obligations and engagements, to cast<br>
him off.<br>
<br>
But the title of highness, and of a princess, and all those fine things,<br>
as they came in, weighed down all this; and the sense of gratitude<br>
vanished as if it had been a shadow.<br>
<br>
At other times I considered the wealth I was mistress of; that I was<br>
able to live like a princess, though not a princess; and that my<br>
merchant (for he had told me all the affair of his misfortunes) was far<br>
from being poor, or even mean; that together we were able to make up an<br>
estate of between three and four thousand pounds a year, which was in<br>
itself equal to some princes abroad. But though this was true, yet the<br>
name of princess, and the flutter of it--in a word, the pride--weighed<br>
them down; and all these arguings generally ended to the disadvantage of<br>
my merchant; so that, in short, I resolved to drop him, and give him a<br>
final answer at his next coming; namely, that something had happened in<br>
my affairs which had caused me to alter my measures unexpectedly, and,<br>
in a word, to desire him to trouble himself no farther.<br>
<br>
I think, verily, this rude treatment of him was for some time the effect<br>
of a violent fermentation in my blood; for the very motion which the<br>
steady contemplation of my fancied greatness had put my spirits into had<br>
thrown me into a kind of fever, and I scarce knew what I did.<br>
<br>
I have wondered since that it did not make me mad; nor do I now think it<br>
strange to hear of those who have been quite lunatic with their pride,<br>
that fancied themselves queens and empresses, and have made their<br>
attendants serve them upon the knee, given visitors their hand to kiss,<br>
and the like; for certainly, if pride will not turn the brain, nothing<br>
can.<br>
<br>
However, the next time my gentleman came, I had not courage enough, or<br>
not ill nature enough, to treat him in the rude manner I had resolved to<br>
do, and it was very well I did not; for soon after, I had another letter<br>
from Amy, in which was the mortifying news, and indeed surprising to me,<br>
that my prince (as I, with a secret pleasure, had called him) was very<br>
much hurt by a bruise he had received in hunting and engaging with a<br>
wild boar, a cruel and desperate sport which the noblemen of Germany, it<br>
seems, much delight in.<br>
<br>
This alarmed me indeed, and the more because Amy wrote me word that his<br>
gentleman was gone away express to him, not without apprehensions that<br>
he should find his master was dead before his coming home; but that he<br>
(the gentleman) had promised her that as soon as he arrived he would<br>
send back the same courier to her with an account of his master's<br>
health, and of the main affair; and that he had obliged Amy to stay at<br>
Paris fourteen days for his return; she having promised him before to<br>
make it her business to go to England and to find me out for his lord if<br>
he sent her such orders; and he was to send her a bill for fifty<br>
pistoles for her journey. So Amy told me she waited for the answer.<br>
<br>
This was a blow to me several ways; for, first, I was in a state of<br>
uncertainty as to his person, whether he was alive or dead; and I was<br>
not unconcerned in that part, I assure you; for I had an inexpressible<br>
affection remaining for his person, besides the degree to which it was<br>
revived by the view of a firmer interest in him. But this was not all,<br>
for in losing him I forever lost the prospect of all the gaiety and<br>
glory that had made such an impression upon my imagination.<br>
<br>
In this state of uncertainty, I say, by Amy's letter, I was like still<br>
to remain another fortnight; and had I now continued the resolution of<br>
using my merchant in the rude manner I once intended, I had made perhaps<br>
a sorry piece of work of it indeed, and it was very well my heart failed<br>
me as it did.<br>
<br>
However, I treated him with a great many shuffles, and feigned stories<br>
to keep him off from any closer conferences than we had already had,<br>
that I might act afterwards as occasion might offer, one way or other.<br>
But that which mortified me most was, that Amy did not write, though the<br>
fourteen days were expired. At last, to my great surprise, when I was,<br>
with the utmost impatience, looking out at the window, expecting the<br>
postman that usually brought the foreign letters--I say I was agreeably<br>
surprised to see a coach come to the yard-gate where we lived, and my<br>
woman Amy alight out of it and come towards the door, having the<br>
coachman bringing several bundles after her.<br>
<br>
I flew like lightning downstairs to speak to her, but was soon damped<br>
with her news. &quot;Is the prince alive or dead, Amy?&quot; says I. She spoke<br>
coldly and slightly. &quot;He is alive, madam,&quot; said she. &quot;But it is not much<br>
matter; I had as lieu he had been dead.&quot; So we went upstairs again to my<br>
chamber, and there we began a serious discourse of the whole matter.<br>
<br>
First, she told me a long story of his being hurt by a wild boar, and of<br>
the condition he was reduced to, so that every one expected he should<br>
die, the anguish of the wound having thrown him into a fever, with<br>
abundance of circumstances too long to relate here; how he recovered of<br>
that extreme danger, but continued very weak; how the gentleman had been<br>
_homme de parole_, and had sent back the courier as punctually as if it<br>
had been to the king; that he had given a long account of his lord, and<br>
of his illness and recovery; but the sum of the matter, as to me, was,<br>
that as to the lady, his lord was turned penitent, was under some vows<br>
for his recovery, and could not think any more on that affair; and<br>
especially, the lady being gone, and that it had not been offered to<br>
her, so there was no breach of honour; but that his lord was sensible of<br>
the good offices of Mrs. Amy, and had sent her the fifty pistoles for<br>
her trouble, as if she had really gone the journey.<br>
<br>
I was, I confess, hardly able to bear the first surprise of this<br>
disappointment. Amy saw it, and gapes out (as was her way), &quot;Lawd,<br>
madam! never be concerned at it; you see he is gotten among the priests,<br>
and I suppose they have saucily imposed some penance upon him, and, it<br>
may be, sent him of an errand barefoot to some Madonna or N&ocirc;tredame, or<br>
other; and he is off of his amours for the present. I'll warrant you<br>
he'll be as wicked again as ever he was when he is got thorough well,<br>
and gets but out of their hands again. I hate this out-o'-season<br>
repentance. What occasion had he, in his repentance, to be off of taking<br>
a good wife? I should have been glad to see you have been a princess,<br>
and all that; but if it can't be, never afflict yourself; you are rich<br>
enough to be a princess to yourself; you don't want him, that's the best<br>
of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I cried for all that, and was heartily vexed, and that a great<br>
while; but as Amy was always at my elbow, and always jogging it out of<br>
my head with her mirth and her wit, it wore off again.<br>
<br>
Then I told Amy all the story of my merchant, and how he had found me<br>
out when I was in such a concern to find him; how it was true that he<br>
lodged in St. Laurence Pountney's Lane; and how I had had all the story<br>
of his misfortune, which she had heard of, in which he had lost above<br>
&pound;8000 sterling; and that he had told me frankly of it before she had<br>
sent me any account of it, or at least before I had taken any notice<br>
that I had heard of it.<br>
<br>
Amy was very joyful at that part. &quot;Well, madam, then,&quot; says Amy, &quot;what<br>
need you value the story of the prince, and going I know not whither<br>
into Germany to lay your bones in another world, and learn the devil's<br>
language, called High Dutch? You are better here by half,&quot; says Amy.<br>
&quot;Lawd, madam!&quot; says she; &quot;why, are you not as rich as Croesus?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, it was a great while still before I could bring myself off of this<br>
fancied sovereignty; and I, that was so willing once to be mistress to a<br>
king, was now ten thousand times more fond of being wife to a prince.<br>
<br>
So fast a hold has pride and ambition upon our minds, that when once it<br>
gets admission, nothing is so chimerical but, under this possession, we<br>
can form ideas of in our fancy and realise to our imagination. Nothing<br>
can be so ridiculous as the simple steps we take in such cases; a man or<br>
a woman becomes a mere _malade imaginaire_, and, I believe, may as<br>
easily die with grief or run mad with joy (as the affair in his fancy<br>
appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actually under the<br>
management of the person.<br>
<br>
I had indeed two assistants to deliver me from this snare, and these<br>
were, first, Amy, who knew my disease, but was able to do nothing as to<br>
the remedy; the second, the merchant, who really brought the remedy, but<br>
knew nothing of the distemper.<br>
<br>
I remember, when all these disorders were upon my thoughts, in one of<br>
the visits my friend the merchant made me, he took notice that he<br>
perceived I was under some unusual disorder; he believed, he said, that<br>
my distemper, whatever it was, lay much in my head, and it being summer<br>
weather and very hot, proposed to me to go a little way into the air.<br>
<br>
I started at his expression. &quot;What!&quot; says I; &quot;do you think, then, that I<br>
am crazed? You should, then, propose a madhouse for my cure.&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;I do not mean anything like that; I hope the head may be<br>
distempered and not the brain.&quot; Well, I was too sensible that he was<br>
right, for I knew I had acted a strange, wild kind of part with him; but<br>
he insisted upon it, and pressed me to go into the country. I took him<br>
short again. &quot;What need you,&quot; says I, &quot;send me out of your way? It is in<br>
your power to be less troubled with me, and with less inconvenience to<br>
us both.&quot;<br>
<br>
He took that ill, and told me I used to have a better opinion of his<br>
sincerity, and desired to know what he had done to forfeit my charity.<br>
I mention this only to let you see how far I had gone in my measures of<br>
quitting him--that is to say, how near I was of showing him how base,<br>
ungrateful, and how vilely I could act; but I found I had carried the<br>
jest far enough, and that a little matter might have made him sick of me<br>
again, as he was before; so I began by little and little to change my<br>
way of talking to him, and to come to discourse to the purpose again as<br>
we had done before.<br>
<br>
A while after this, when we were very merry and talking familiarly<br>
together, he called me, with an air of particular satisfaction, his<br>
princess. I coloured at the word, for it indeed touched me to the quick;<br>
but he knew nothing of the reason of my being touched with it. &quot;What<br>
d'ye mean by that?&quot; said I. &quot;Nay,&quot; says he, &quot;I mean nothing but that you<br>
are a princess to me.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;as to that I am content, and yet<br>
I could tell you I might have been a princess if I would have quitted<br>
you, and believe I could be so still.&quot; &quot;It is not in my power to make<br>
you a princess,&quot; says he, &quot;but I can easily make you a lady here in<br>
England, and a countess too if you will go out of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I heard both with a great deal of satisfaction, for my pride remained<br>
though it had been balked, and I thought with myself that this proposal<br>
would make me some amends for the loss of the title that had so tickled<br>
my imagination another way, and I was impatient to understand what he<br>
meant, but I would not ask him by any means; so it passed off for that<br>
time.<br>
<br>
When he was gone I told Amy what he had said, and Amy was as impatient<br>
to know the manner how it could be as I was; but the next time<br>
(perfectly unexpected to me) he told me that he had accidentally<br>
mentioned a thing to me last time he was with me, having not the least<br>
thought of the thing itself; but not knowing but such a thing might be<br>
of some weight to me, and that it might bring me respect among people<br>
where I might appear, he had thought since of it, and was resolved to<br>
ask me about it.<br>
<br>
I made light of it, and told him that, as he knew I had chosen a retired<br>
life, it was of no value to me to be called lady or countess either; but<br>
that if he intended to drag me, as I might call it, into the world<br>
again, perhaps it might be agreeable to him; but, besides that, I could<br>
not judge of the thing, because I did not understand how either of them<br>
was to be done.<br>
<br>
He told me that money purchased titles of honour in almost all parts of<br>
the world, though money could not give principles of honour, they must<br>
come by birth and blood; that, however, titles sometimes assist to<br>
elevate the soul and to infuse generous principles into the mind, and<br>
especially where there was a good foundation laid in the persons; that<br>
he hoped we should neither of us misbehave if we came to it; and that as<br>
we knew how to wear a title without undue elevations, so it might sit as<br>
well upon us as on another; that as to England, he had nothing to do<br>
but to get an act of naturalisation in his favour, and he knew where to<br>
purchase a patent for baronet--that is say, to have the honour and title<br>
transferred to him; but if I intended to go abroad with him, he had a<br>
nephew, the son of his eldest brother, who had the title of count, with<br>
the estate annexed, which was but small, and that he had frequently<br>
offered to make it over to him for a thousand pistoles, which was not a<br>
great deal of money, and considering it was in the family already, he<br>
would, upon my being willing, purchase it immediately.<br>
<br>
I told him I liked the last best, but then I would not let him buy it<br>
unless he would let me pay the thousand pistoles. &quot;No, no,&quot; says he, &quot;I<br>
refused a thousand pistoles that I had more right to have accepted than<br>
that, and you shall not be at so much expense now.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says I, &quot;you<br>
did refuse it, and perhaps repented it afterwards.&quot; &quot;I never<br>
complained,&quot; said he. &quot;But I did,&quot; says I, &quot;and often repented it for<br>
you.&quot; &quot;I do not understand you,&quot; says he. &quot;Why,&quot; said I, &quot;I repented<br>
that I suffered you to refuse it.&quot; &quot;Well, well,&quot; said he, &quot;we may talk<br>
of that hereafter, when you shall resolve which part of the world you<br>
will make your settled residence in.&quot; Here he talked very handsomely to<br>
me, and for a good while together; how it had been his lot to live all<br>
his days out of his native country, and to be often shifting and<br>
changing the situation of his affairs; and that I myself had not always<br>
had a fixed abode, but that now, as neither of us was very young, he<br>
fancied I would be for taking up our abode where, if possible, we might<br>
remove no more; that as to his part, he was of that opinion entirely,<br>
only with this exception, that the choice of the place should be mine,<br>
for that all places in the world were alike to him, only with this<br>
single addition, namely, that I was with him.<br>
<br>
I heard him with a great deal of pleasure, as well for his being willing<br>
to give me the choice as for that I resolved to live abroad, for the<br>
reason I have mentioned already, namely, lest I should at any time be<br>
known in England, and all that story of Roxana and the balls should come<br>
out; as also I was not a little tickled with the satisfaction of being<br>
still a countess, though I could not be a princess.<br>
<br>
I told Amy all this story, for she was still my privy councillor; but<br>
when I asked her opinion, she made me laugh heartily. &quot;Now, which of the<br>
two shall I take, Amy?&quot; said I. &quot;Shall I be a lady--that is, a baronet's<br>
lady in England, or a countess in Holland?&quot; The ready-witted jade, that<br>
knew the pride of my temper too, almost as well as I did myself,<br>
answered (without the least hesitation), &quot;Both, madam. Which of them?&quot;<br>
says she (repeating the words). &quot;Why not both of them? and then you will<br>
be really a princess; for, sure, to be a lady in English and a countess<br>
in Dutch may make a princess in High Dutch.&quot; Upon the whole, though Amy<br>
was in jest, she put the thought into my head, and I resolved that, in<br>
short, I would be both of them, which I managed as you shall hear.<br>
<br>
First, I seemed to resolve that I would live and settle in England, only<br>
with this condition, namely, that I would not live in London. I<br>
pretended that it would choke me up; that I wanted breath when I was in<br>
London, but that anywhere else I would be satisfied; and then I asked<br>
him whether any seaport town in England would not suit him; because I<br>
knew, though he seemed to leave off, he would always love to be among<br>
business, and conversing with men of business; and I named several<br>
places, either nearest for business with France or with Holland; as<br>
Dover or Southampton, for the first; and Ipswich, or Yarmouth, or Hull<br>
for the last; but I took care that we would resolve upon nothing; only<br>
by this it seemed to be certain that we should live in England.<br>
<br>
It was time now to bring things to a conclusion, and so in about six<br>
weeks' time more we settled all our preliminaries; and, among the rest,<br>
he let me know that he should have the bill for his naturalisation<br>
passed time enough, so that he would be (as he called it) an Englishman<br>
before we married. That was soon perfected, the Parliament being then<br>
sitting, and several other foreigners joining in the said bill to save<br>
the expense.<br>
<br>
It was not above three or four days after, but that, without giving me<br>
the least notice that he had so much as been about the patent for<br>
baronet, he brought it me in a fine embroidered bag, and saluting me by<br>
the name of my Lady ---- (joining his own surname to it), presented it<br>
to me with his picture set with diamonds, and at the same time gave me a<br>
breast-jewel worth a thousand pistoles, and the next morning we were<br>
married. Thus I put an end to all the intriguing part of my life--a life<br>
full of prosperous wickedness; the reflections upon which were so much<br>
the more afflicting as the time had been spent in the grossest crimes,<br>
which, the more I looked back upon, the more black and horrid they<br>
appeared, effectually drinking up all the comfort and satisfaction which<br>
I might otherwise have taken in that part of life which was still before<br>
me.<br>
<br>
The first satisfaction, however, that I took in the new condition I was<br>
in was in reflecting that at length the life of crime was over, and that<br>
I was like a passenger coming back from the Indies, who, having, after<br>
many years' fatigues and hurry in business, gotten a good estate, with<br>
innumerable difficulties and hazards, is arrived safe at London with all<br>
his effects, and has the pleasure of saying he shall never venture upon<br>
the seas any more.<br>
<br>
When we were married we came back immediately to my lodgings (for the<br>
church was but just by), and we were so privately married that none but<br>
Amy and my friend the Quaker was acquainted with it. As soon as we came<br>
into the house he took me in his arms, and kissing me, &quot;Now you are my<br>
own,&quot; says he. &quot;Oh that you had been so good to have done this eleven<br>
years ago!&quot; &quot;Then,&quot; said I, &quot;you, perhaps, would have been tired of me<br>
long ago; it is much better now, for now all our happy days are to come.<br>
Besides,&quot; said I, &quot;I should not have been half so rich;&quot; but that I said<br>
to myself, for there was no letting him into the reason of it. &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;I should not have been tired of you; but, besides having the<br>
satisfaction of your company, it had saved me that unlucky blow at<br>
Paris, which was a dead loss to me of above eight thousand pistoles, and<br>
all the fatigues of so many years' hurry and business;&quot; and then he<br>
added, &quot;But I'll make you pay for it all, now I have you.&quot; I started a<br>
little at the words. &quot;Ay,&quot; said I, &quot;do you threaten already? Pray what<br>
d'ye mean by that?&quot; and began to look a little grave.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; says he, &quot;very plainly what I mean;&quot; and still he held<br>
me fast in his arms. &quot;I intend from this time never to trouble myself<br>
with any more business, so I shall never get one shilling for you more<br>
than I have already; all that you will lose one way. Next, I intend not<br>
to trouble myself with any of the care or trouble of managing what<br>
either you have for me or what I have to add to it; but you shall e'en<br>
take it all upon yourself, as the wives do in Holland; so you will pay<br>
for it that way too, for all the drudgery shall be yours. Thirdly, I<br>
intend to condemn you to the constant bondage of my impertinent company,<br>
for I shall tie you like a pedlar's pack at my back. I shall scarce<br>
ever be from you; for I am sure I can take delight in nothing else in<br>
this world.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; says I; &quot;but I am pretty heavy. I hope you'll<br>
set me down sometimes when you are aweary.&quot; &quot;As for that,&quot; says he,<br>
&quot;tire me if you can.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was all jest and allegory; but it was all true, in the moral of the<br>
fable, as you shall hear in its place. We were very merry the rest of<br>
the day, but without any noise or clutter; for he brought not one of his<br>
acquaintance or friends, either English or foreigner. The honest Quaker<br>
provided us a very noble dinner indeed, considering how few we were to<br>
eat it; and every day that week she did the like, and would at last have<br>
it be all at her own charge, which I was utterly averse to; first,<br>
because I knew her circumstances not to be very great, though not very<br>
low; and next, because she had been so true a friend, and so cheerful a<br>
comforter to me, ay, and counsellor too, in all this affair, that I had<br>
resolved to make her a present that should be some help to her when all<br>
was over.<br>
<br>
But to return to the circumstances of our wedding. After being very<br>
merry, as I have told you, Amy and the Quaker put us to bed, the honest<br>
Quaker little thinking we had been abed together eleven years before.<br>
Nay, that was a secret which, as it happened, Amy herself did not know.<br>
Amy grinned and made faces, as if she had been pleased; but it came out<br>
in so many words, when he was not by, the sum of her mumbling and<br>
muttering was, that this should have been done ten or a dozen years<br>
before; that it would signify little now; that was to say, in short,<br>
that her mistress was pretty near fifty, and too old to have any<br>
children. I chid her; the Quaker laughed, complimented me upon my not<br>
being so old as Amy pretended, that I could not be above forty, and<br>
might have a house full of children yet. But Amy and I too knew better<br>
than she how it was, for, in short, I was old enough to have done<br>
breeding, however I looked; but I made her hold her tongue.<br>
<br>
In the morning my Quaker landlady came and visited us before we were up,<br>
and made us eat cakes and drink chocolate in bed; and then left us<br>
again, and bid us take a nap upon it, which I believe we did. In short,<br>
she treated us so handsomely, and with such an agreeable cheerfulness,<br>
as well as plenty, as made it appear to me that Quakers may, and that<br>
this Quaker did, understand good manners as well as any other people.<br>
<br>
I resisted her offer, however, of treating us for the whole week; and I<br>
opposed it so long that I saw evidently that she took it ill, and would<br>
have thought herself slighted if we had not accepted it. So I said no<br>
more, but let her go on, only told her I would be even with her; and so<br>
I was. However, for that week she treated us as she said she would, and<br>
did it so very fine, and with such a profusion of all sorts of good<br>
things, that the greatest burthen to her was how to dispose of things<br>
that were left; for she never let anything, how dainty or however large,<br>
be so much as seen twice among us.<br>
<br>
I had some servants indeed, which helped her off a little; that is to<br>
say, two maids, for Amy was now a woman of business, not a servant, and<br>
ate always with us. I had also a coachman and a boy. My Quaker had a<br>
man-servant too, but had but one maid; but she borrowed two more of some<br>
of her friends for the occasion, and had a man-cook for dressing the<br>
victuals.<br>
<br>
She was only at a loss for plate, which she gave me a whisper of; and I<br>
made Amy fetch a large strong-box, which I had lodged in a safe hand, in<br>
which was all the fine plate which I had provided on a worse occasion,<br>
as is mentioned before; and I put it into the Quaker's hand, obliging<br>
her not to use it as mine, but as her own, for a reason I shall mention<br>
presently.<br>
<br>
I was now my Lady ----, and I must own I was exceedingly pleased with<br>
it; 'twas so big and so great to hear myself called &quot;her ladyship,&quot; and<br>
&quot;your ladyship,&quot; and the like, that I was like the Indian king at<br>
Virginia, who, having a house built for him by the English, and a lock<br>
put upon the door, would sit whole days together with the key in his<br>
hand, locking and unlocking, and double-locking, the door, with an<br>
unaccountable pleasure at the novelty; so I could have sat a whole day<br>
together to hear Amy talk to me, and call me &quot;your ladyship&quot; at every<br>
word; but after a while the novelty wore off and the pride of it abated,<br>
till at last truly I wanted the other title as much as I did that of<br>
ladyship before.<br>
<br>
We lived this week in all the innocent mirth imaginable, and our<br>
good-humoured Quaker was so pleasant in her way that it was particularly<br>
entertaining to us. We had no music at all, or dancing; only I now and<br>
then sung a French song to divert my spouse, who desired it, and the<br>
privacy of our mirth greatly added to the pleasure of it. I did not make<br>
many clothes for my wedding, having always a great many rich clothes by<br>
me, which, with a little altering for the fashion, were perfectly new.<br>
The next day he pressed me to dress, though we had no company. At last,<br>
jesting with him, I told him I believed I was able to dress me so, in<br>
one kind of dress that I had by me, that he would not know his wife when<br>
he saw her, especially if anybody else was by. No, he said, that was<br>
impossible, and he longed to see that dress. I told him I would dress me<br>
in it, if he would promise me never to desire me to appear in it before<br>
company. He promised he would not, but wanted to know why too; as<br>
husbands, you know, are inquisitive creatures, and love to inquire after<br>
anything they think is kept from them; but I had an answer ready for<br>
him. &quot;Because,&quot; said I, &quot;it is not a decent dress in this country, and<br>
would not look modest.&quot; Neither, indeed, would it, for it was but one<br>
degree off from appearing in one's shift, but was the usual wear in the<br>
country where they were used. He was satisfied with my answer, and gave<br>
me his promise never to ask me to be seen in it before company. I then<br>
withdrew, taking only Amy and the Quaker with me; and Amy dressed me in<br>
my old Turkish habit which I danced in formerly, &amp;c., as before. The<br>
Quaker was charmed with the dress, and merrily said, that if such a<br>
dress should come to be worn here, she should not know what to do; she<br>
should be tempted not to dress in the Quaker's way any more.<br>
<br>
When all the dress was put on, I loaded it with jewels, and in<br>
particular I placed the large breast-jewel which he had given me of a<br>
thousand pistoles upon the front of the _tyhaia_, or head-dress, where<br>
it made a most glorious show indeed. I had my own diamond necklace on,<br>
and my hair was _tout brilliant_, all glittering with jewels.<br>
<br>
His picture set with diamonds I had placed stitched to my vest, just, as<br>
might be supposed, upon my heart (which is the compliment in such cases<br>
among the Eastern people); and all being open at the breast, there was<br>
no room for anything of a jewel there.<br>
<br>
In this figure, Amy holding the train of my robe, I came down to him. He<br>
was surprised, and perfectly astonished. He knew me, to be sure, because<br>
I had prepared him, and because there was nobody else there but the<br>
Quaker and Amy; but he by no means knew Amy, for she had dressed herself<br>
in the habit of a Turkish slave, being the garb of my little Turk which<br>
I had at Naples, as I have said; she had her neck and arms bare, was<br>
bareheaded, and her hair braided in a long tassel hanging down her back;<br>
but the jade could neither hold her countenance or her chattering<br>
tongue, so as to be concealed long.<br>
<br>
Well, he was so charmed with this dress that he would have me sit and<br>
dine in it; but it was so thin, and so open before, and the weather<br>
being also sharp, that I was afraid of taking cold; however, the fire<br>
being enlarged and the doors kept shut, I sat to oblige him, and he<br>
professed he never saw so fine a dress in his life. I afterwards told<br>
him that my husband (so he called the jeweller that was killed) bought<br>
it for me at Leghorn, with a young Turkish slave which I parted with at<br>
Paris; and that it was by the help of that slave that I learned how to<br>
dress in it, and how everything was to be worn, and many of the Turkish<br>
customs also, with some of their language. This story agreeing with the<br>
fact, only changing the person, was very natural, and so it went off<br>
with him; but there was good reason why I should not receive any company<br>
in this dress--that is to say, not in England. I need not repeat it; you<br>
will hear more of it.<br>
<br>
But when I came abroad I frequently put it on, and upon two or three<br>
occasions danced in it, but always at his request.<br>
<br>
We continued at the Quaker's lodgings for above a year; for now, making<br>
as though it was difficult to determine where to settle in England to<br>
his satisfaction, unless in London, which was not to mine, I pretended<br>
to make him an offer, that, to oblige him, I began to incline to go and<br>
live abroad with him; that I knew nothing could be more agreeable to<br>
him, and that as to me, every place was alike; that, as I had lived<br>
abroad without a husband so many years, it could be no burthen to me to<br>
live abroad again, especially with him. Then we fell to straining our<br>
courtesies upon one another. He told me he was perfectly easy at living<br>
in England, and had squared all his affairs accordingly; for that, as he<br>
had told me he intended to give over all business in the world, as well<br>
the care of managing it as the concern about it, seeing we were both in<br>
condition neither to want it or to have it be worth our while, so I<br>
might see it was his intention, by his getting himself naturalised, and<br>
getting the patent of baronet, &amp;c. Well, for all that, I told him I<br>
accepted his compliment, but I could not but know that his native<br>
country, where his children were breeding up, must be most agreeable to<br>
him, and that, if I was of such value to him, I would be there then, to<br>
enhance the rate of his satisfaction; that wherever he was would be a<br>
home to me, and any place in the world would be England to me if he was<br>
with me; and thus, in short, I brought him to give me leave to oblige<br>
him with going to live abroad, when, in truth, I could not have been<br>
perfectly easy at living in England, unless I had kept constantly within<br>
doors, lest some time or other the dissolute life I had lived here<br>
should have come to be known, and all those wicked things have been<br>
known too, which I now began to be very much ashamed of.<br>
<br>
When we closed up our wedding week, in which our Quaker had been so very<br>
handsome to us, I told him how much I thought we were obliged to her for<br>
her generous carriage to us; how she had acted the kindest part through<br>
the whole, and how faithful a friend she had been to me upon all<br>
occasions; and then letting him know a little of her family unhappiness,<br>
I proposed that I thought I not only ought to be grateful to her, but<br>
really to do something extraordinary for her, towards making her easy in<br>
her affairs. And I added, that I had no hangers-on that should trouble<br>
him; that there was nobody belonged to me but what was thoroughly<br>
provided for, and that, if I did something for this honest woman that<br>
was considerable, it should be the last gift I would give to anybody in<br>
the world but Amy; and as for her, we were not agoing to turn her<br>
adrift, but whenever anything offered for her, we would do as we saw<br>
cause; that, in the meantime, Amy was not poor, that she had saved<br>
together between seven and eight hundred pounds. By the way, I did not<br>
tell him how, and by what wicked ways she got it, but that she had it;<br>
and that was enough to let him know she would never be in want of us.<br>
<br>
My spouse was exceedingly pleased with my discourse about the Quaker,<br>
made a kind of a speech to me upon the subject of gratitude, told me it<br>
was one of the brightest parts of a gentlewoman, that it was so twisted<br>
with honesty, nay, and even with religion too, that he questioned<br>
whether either of them could be found where gratitude was not to be<br>
found; that in this act there was not only gratitude, but charity; and<br>
that to make the charity still more Christian-like, the object too had<br>
real merit to attract it; he therefore agreed to the thing with all his<br>
heart, only would have had me let him pay it out of his effects.<br>
<br>
I told him, as for that, I did not design, whatever I had said formerly,<br>
that we should have two pockets; and that though I had talked to him of<br>
being a free woman, and an independent, and the like, and he had offered<br>
and promised that I should keep all my own estate in my own hands; yet,<br>
that since I had taken him, I would e'en do as other honest wives<br>
did--where I thought fit to give myself, I should give what I had too;<br>
that if I reserved anything, it should be only in case of mortality, and<br>
that I might give it to his children afterwards, as my own gift; and<br>
that, in short, if he thought fit to join stocks, we would see to-morrow<br>
morning what strength we could both make up in the world, and bringing<br>
it all together, consider, before we resolved upon the place of<br>
removing, how we should dispose of what we had, as well as of ourselves.<br>
This discourse was too obliging, and he too much of a man of sense not<br>
to receive it as it was meant. He only answered, we would do in that as<br>
we should both agree; but the thing under our present care was to show<br>
not gratitude only, but charity and affection too, to our kind friend<br>
the Quaker; and the first word he spoke of was to settle a thousand<br>
pounds upon her for her life--that is to say, sixty pounds a year--but<br>
in such a manner as not to be in the power of any person to reach but<br>
herself. This was a great thing, and indeed showed the generous<br>
principles of my husband, and for that reason I mention it; but I<br>
thought that a little too much too, and particularly because I had<br>
another thing in view for her about the plate; so I told him I thought,<br>
if he gave her a purse with a hundred guineas as a present first, and<br>
then made her a compliment of &pound;40 per annum for her life, secured any<br>
such way as she should desire, it would be very handsome.<br>
<br>
He agreed to that; and the same day, in the evening, when we were just<br>
going to bed, he took my Quaker by the hand, and, with a kiss, told her<br>
that we had been very kindly treated by her from the beginning of this<br>
affair, and his wife before, as she (meaning me) had informed him; and<br>
that he thought himself bound to let her see that she had obliged<br>
friends who knew how to be grateful; that for his part of the obligation<br>
he desired she would accept of that, for an acknowledgment in part only<br>
(putting the gold into her hand), and that his wife would talk with her<br>
about what farther he had to say to her; and upon that, not giving her<br>
time hardly to say &quot;Thank ye,&quot; away he went upstairs into our<br>
bedchamber, leaving her confused and not knowing what to say.<br>
<br>
When he was gone she began to make very handsome and obliging<br>
representations of her goodwill to us both, but that it was without<br>
expectation of reward; that I had given her several valuable presents<br>
before--and so, indeed, I had; for, besides the piece of linen which I<br>
had given her at first, I had given her a suit of damask table-linen, of<br>
the linen I bought for my balls, viz., three table-cloths and three<br>
dozen of napkins; and at another time I gave her a little necklace of<br>
gold beads, and the like; but that is by the way. But she mentioned<br>
them, I say, and how she was obliged by me on many other occasions; that<br>
she was not in condition to show her gratitude any other way, not being<br>
able to make a suitable return; and that now we took from her all<br>
opportunity, to balance my former friendship, and left her more in debt<br>
than she was before. She spoke this in a very good kind of manner, in<br>
her own way, but which was very agreeable indeed, and had as much<br>
apparent sincerity, and I verily believe as real as was possible to be<br>
expressed; but I put a stop to it, and bade her say no more, but accept<br>
of what my spouse had given her, which was but in part, as she had heard<br>
him say. &quot;And put it up,&quot; says I, &quot;and come and sit down here, and give<br>
me leave to say something else to you on the same head, which my spouse<br>
and I have settled between ourselves in your behalf.&quot; &quot;What dost thee<br>
mean?&quot; says she, and blushed, and looked surprised, but did not stir.<br>
She was going to speak again, but I interrupted her, and told her she<br>
should make no more apologies of any kind whatever, for I had better<br>
things than all this to talk to her of; so I went on, and told her, that<br>
as she had been so friendly and kind to us on every occasion, and that<br>
her house was the lucky place where we came together, and that she knew<br>
I was from her own mouth acquainted in part with her circumstances, we<br>
were resolved she should be the better for us as long as she lived. Then<br>
I told what we had resolved to do for her, and that she had nothing more<br>
to do but to consult with me how it should be effectually secured for<br>
her, distinct from any of the effects which were her husband's; and that<br>
if her husband did so supply her that she could live comfortably, and<br>
not want it for bread or other necessaries, she should not make use of<br>
it, but lay up the income of it, and add it every year to the principal,<br>
so to increase the annual payment, which in time, and perhaps before she<br>
might come to want it, might double itself; that we were very willing<br>
whatever she should so lay up should be to herself, and whoever she<br>
thought fit after her; but that the forty pounds a year must return to<br>
our family after her life, which we both wished might be long and happy.<br>
<br>
Let no reader wonder at my extraordinary concern for this poor woman, or<br>
at my giving my bounty to her a place in this account. It is not, I<br>
assure you, to make a pageantry of my charity, or to value myself upon<br>
the greatness of my soul, that should give in so profuse a manner as<br>
this, which was above my figure, if my wealth had been twice as much as<br>
it was; but there was another spring from whence all flowed, and 'tis on<br>
that account I speak of it. Was it possible I could think of a poor<br>
desolate woman with four children, and her husband gone from her, and<br>
perhaps good for little if he had stayed--I say, was I, that had tasted<br>
so deep of the sorrows of such a kind of widowhood, able to look on her,<br>
and think of her circumstances, and not be touched in an uncommon<br>
manner? No, no; I never looked on her and her family, though she was not<br>
left so helpless and friendless as I had been, without remembering my<br>
own condition, when Amy was sent out to pawn or sell my pair of stays to<br>
buy a breast of mutton and a bunch of turnips; nor could I look on her<br>
poor children, though not poor and perishing, like mine, without tears;<br>
reflecting on the dreadful condition that mine were reduced to, when<br>
poor Amy sent them all into their aunt's in Spitalfields, and run away<br>
from them. These were the original springs, or fountain-head, from<br>
whence my affectionate thoughts were moved to assist this poor woman.<br>
<br>
When a poor debtor, having lain long in the Compter, or Ludgate, or the<br>
King's Bench for debt, afterwards gets out, rises again in the world,<br>
and grows rich, such a one is a certain benefactor to the prisoners<br>
there, and perhaps to every prison he passes by as long as he lives, for<br>
he remembers the dark days of his own sorrow; and even those who never<br>
had the experience of such sorrows to stir up their minds to acts of<br>
charity would have the same charitable, good disposition did they as<br>
sensibly remember what it is that distinguishes them from others by a<br>
more favourable and merciful Providence.<br>
<br>
This, I say, was, however, the spring of my concern for this honest,<br>
friendly, and grateful Quaker; and as I had so plentiful a fortune in<br>
the world, I resolved she should taste the fruit of her kind usage to me<br>
in a manner that she could not expect.<br>
<br>
All the while I talked to her I saw the disorder of her mind; the sudden<br>
joy was too much for her, and she coloured, trembled, changed, and at<br>
last grew pale, and was indeed near fainting, when she hastily rung a<br>
little bell for her maid, who coming in immediately, she beckoned to<br>
her--for speak she could not--to fill her a glass of wine; but she had<br>
no breath to take it in, and was almost choked with that which she took<br>
in her mouth. I saw she was ill, and assisted her what I could, and with<br>
spirits and things to smell to just kept her from fainting, when she<br>
beckoned to her maid to withdraw, and immediately burst out in crying,<br>
and that relieved her. When she recovered herself a little she flew to<br>
me, and throwing her arms about my neck, &quot;Oh!&quot; says she, &quot;thou hast<br>
almost killed me;&quot; and there she hung, laying her head in my neck for<br>
half a quarter of an hour, not able to speak, but sobbing like a child<br>
that had been whipped.<br>
<br>
I was very sorry that I did not stop a little in the middle of my<br>
discourse and make her drink a glass of wine before it had put her<br>
spirits into such a violent motion; but it was too late, and it was ten<br>
to one odds but that it had killed her.<br>
<br>
But she came to herself at last, and began to say some very good things<br>
in return for my kindness. I would not let her go on, but told her I had<br>
more to say to her still than all this, but that I would let it alone<br>
till another time. My meaning was about the box of plate, good part of<br>
which I gave her, and some I gave to Amy; for I had so much plate, and<br>
some so large, that I thought if I let my husband see it he might be apt<br>
to wonder what occasion I could ever have for so much, and for plate of<br>
such a kind too; as particularly a great cistern for bottles, which cost<br>
a hundred and twenty pounds, and some large candlesticks too big for any<br>
ordinary use. These I caused Amy to sell; in short, Amy sold above three<br>
hundred pounds' worth of plate; what I gave the Quaker was worth above<br>
sixty pounds, and I gave Amy above thirty pounds' worth, and yet I had a<br>
great deal left for my husband.<br>
<br>
Nor did our kindness to the Quaker end with the forty pounds a year, for<br>
we were always, while we stayed with her, which was above ten months,<br>
giving her one good thing or another; and, in a word, instead of lodging<br>
with her, she boarded with us, for I kept the house, and she and all<br>
her family ate and drank with us, and yet we paid her the rent of the<br>
house too; in short, I remembered my widowhood, and I made this widow's<br>
heart glad many a day the more upon that account.<br>
<br>
And now my spouse and I began to think of going over to Holland, where I<br>
had proposed to him to live, and in order to settle all the<br>
preliminaries of our future manner of living, I began to draw in my<br>
effects, so as to have them all at command upon whatever occasion we<br>
thought fit; after which, one morning I called my spouse up to me: &quot;Hark<br>
ye, sir,&quot; said I to him, &quot;I have two very weighty questions to ask of<br>
you. I don't know what answer you will give to the first, but I doubt<br>
you will be able to give but a sorry answer to the other, and yet, I<br>
assure you, it is of the last importance to yourself, and towards the<br>
future part of your life, wherever it is to be.&quot;<br>
<br>
He did not seem to be much alarmed, because he could see I was speaking<br>
in a kind of merry way. &quot;Let's hear your questions, my dear,&quot; says he,<br>
&quot;and I'll give the best answer I can to them.&quot; &quot;Why, first,&quot; says I:<br>
<br>
&quot;I. You have married a wife here, made her a lady, and put her in<br>
expectation of being something else still when she comes abroad. Pray<br>
have you examined whether you are able to supply all her extravagant<br>
demands when she comes abroad, and maintain an expensive Englishwoman in<br>
all her pride and vanity? In short, have you inquired whether you are<br>
able to keep her?<br>
<br>
&quot;II. You have married a wife here, and given her a great many fine<br>
things, and you maintain her like a princess, and sometimes call her so.<br>
Pray what portion have you had with her? what fortune has she been to<br>
you? and where does her estate lie, that you keep her so fine? I am<br>
afraid that you keep her in a figure a great deal above her estate, at<br>
least above all that you have seen of it yet. Are you sure you han't got<br>
a bite, and that you have not made a beggar a lady?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;have you any more questions to ask? Let's have them<br>
all together; perhaps they may be all answered in a few words, as well<br>
as these two.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says I, &quot;these are the two grand questions--at<br>
least for the present.&quot; &quot;Why, then,&quot; says he, &quot;I'll answer you in a few<br>
words; that I am fully master of my own circumstances, and, without<br>
farther inquiry, can let my wife you speak of know, that as I have made<br>
her a lady I can maintain her as a lady, wherever she goes with me; and<br>
this whether I have one pistole of her portion, or whether she has any<br>
portion or no; and as I have not inquired whether she has any portion or<br>
not, so she shall not have the less respect showed her from me, or be<br>
obliged to live meaner, or be anyways straitened on that account; on the<br>
contrary, if she goes abroad to live with me in my own country, I will<br>
make her more than a lady, and support the expense of it too, without<br>
meddling with anything she has; and this, I suppose,&quot; says he, &quot;contains<br>
an answer to both your questions together.&quot;<br>
<br>
He spoke this with a great deal more earnestness in his countenance than<br>
I had when I proposed my questions, and said a great many kind things<br>
upon it, as the consequence of former discourses, so that I was obliged<br>
to be in earnest too. &quot;My dear,&quot; says I, &quot;I was but in jest in my<br>
questions; but they were proposed to introduce what I am going to say to<br>
you in earnest; namely, that if I am to go abroad, 'tis time I should<br>
let you know how things stand, and what I have to bring you with your<br>
wife; how it is to be disposed and secured, and the like; and therefore<br>
come,&quot; says I, &quot;sit down, and let me show you your bargain here; I hope<br>
you will find that you have not got a wife without a fortune.&quot;<br>
<br>
He told me then, that since he found I was in earnest, he desired that I<br>
would adjourn it till to-morrow, and then we would do as the poor people<br>
do after they marry, feel in their pockets, and see how much money they<br>
can bring together in the world. &quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;with all my heart;&quot;<br>
and so we ended our talk for that time.<br>
<br>
As this was in the morning, my spouse went out after dinner to his<br>
goldsmith's, as he said, and about three hours after returns with a<br>
porter and two large boxes with him; and his servant brought another<br>
box, which I observed was almost as heavy as the two that the porter<br>
brought, and made the poor fellow sweat heartily; he dismissed the<br>
porter, and in a little while after went out again with his man, and<br>
returning at night, brought another porter with more boxes and bundles,<br>
and all was carried up, and put into a chamber, next to our bedchamber;<br>
and in the morning he called for a pretty large round table, and began<br>
to unpack.<br>
<br>
When the boxes were opened, I found they were chiefly full of books, and<br>
papers, and parchments, I mean books of accounts, and writings, and such<br>
things as were in themselves of no moment to me, because I understood<br>
them not; but I perceived he took them all out, and spread them about<br>
him upon the table and chairs, and began to be very busy with them; so I<br>
withdrew and left him; and he was indeed so busy among them, that he<br>
never missed me till I had been gone a good while; but when he had gone<br>
through all his papers, and come to open a little box, he called for me<br>
again. &quot;Now,&quot; says he, and called me his countess, &quot;I am ready to answer<br>
your first question; if you will sit down till I have opened this box,<br>
we will see how it stands.&quot;<br>
<br>
So we opened the box; there was in it indeed what I did not expect, for<br>
I thought he had sunk his estate rather than raised it; but he produced<br>
me in goldsmiths' bills, and stock in the English East India Company,<br>
about sixteen thousand pounds sterling; then he gave into my hands nine<br>
assignments upon the Bank of Lyons in France, and two upon the rents of<br>
the town-house in Paris, amounting in the whole to 5800 crowns per<br>
annum, or annual rent, as it is called there; and lastly, the sum of<br>
30,000 rixdollars in the Bank of Amsterdam; besides some jewels and gold<br>
in the box to the value of about &pound;1500 or &pound;1600, among which was a very<br>
good necklace of pearl of about &pound;200 value; and that he pulled out and<br>
tied about my neck, telling me that should not be reckoned into the<br>
account.<br>
<br>
I was equally pleased and surprised, and it was with an inexpressible<br>
joy that I saw him so rich.<br>
<br>
&quot;You might well tell me,&quot; said I, &quot;that you were able to make me<br>
countess, and maintain me as such.&quot; In short, he was immensely rich; for<br>
besides all this, he showed me, which was the reason of his being so<br>
busy among the books, I say, he showed me several adventures he had<br>
abroad in the business of his merchandise; as particularly an eighth<br>
share in an East India ship then abroad; an account-courant with a<br>
merchant at Cadiz in Spain; about &pound;3000 lent upon bottomry, upon ships<br>
gone to the Indies; and a large cargo of goods in a merchant's hands,<br>
for sale at Lisbon in Portugal; so that in his books there was about<br>
&pound;12,000 more; all which put together, made about &pound;27,000 sterling, and<br>
&pound;1320 a year.<br>
<br>
I stood amazed at this account, as well I might, and said nothing to him<br>
for a good while, and the rather because I saw him still busy looking<br>
over his books. After a while, as I was going to express my wonder,<br>
&quot;Hold, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;this is not all neither;&quot; then he pulled me<br>
out some old seals, and small parchment rolls, which I did not<br>
understand; but he told me they were a right of reversion which he had<br>
to a paternal estate in his family, and a mortgage of 14,000 rixdollars,<br>
which he had upon it, in the hands of the present possessor; so that was<br>
about &pound;3000 more.<br>
<br>
&quot;But now hold again,&quot; says he, &quot;for I must pay my debts out of all this,<br>
and they are very great, I assure you;&quot; and the first he said was a<br>
black article of 8000 pistoles, which he had a lawsuit about at Paris,<br>
but had it awarded against him, which was the loss he had told me of,<br>
and which made him leave Paris in disgust; that in other accounts he<br>
owed about &pound;5300 sterling; but after all this, upon the whole, he had<br>
still &pound;17,000 clear stock in money, and &pound;1320 a year in rent.<br>
<br>
After some pause, it came to my turn to speak. &quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;'tis<br>
very hard a gentleman with such a fortune as this should come over to<br>
England, and marry a wife with nothing; it shall never,&quot; says I, &quot;be<br>
said, but what I have, I'll bring into the public stock;&quot; so I began to<br>
produce.<br>
<br>
First, I pulled out the mortgage which good Sir Robert had procured for<br>
me, the annual rent &pound;700 per annum; the principal money &pound;14,000.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I pulled out another mortgage upon land, procured by the same<br>
faithful friend, which at three times had advanced &pound;12,000.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I pulled him out a parcel of little securities, procured by<br>
several hands, by fee-farm rents, and such petty mortgages as those<br>
times afforded, amounting to &pound;10,800 principal money, and paying six<br>
hundred and thirty-six pounds a-year. So that in the whole there was two<br>
thousand and fifty-six pounds a year ready money constantly coming in.<br>
<br>
When I had shown him all these, I laid them upon the table, and bade him<br>
take them, that he might be able to give me an answer to the second<br>
question. What fortune he had with his wife? And laughed a little at it.<br>
<br>
He looked at them awhile, and then handed them all back again to me: &quot;I<br>
will not touch them,&quot; says he, &quot;nor one of them, till they are all<br>
settled in trustees' hands for your own use, and the management wholly<br>
your own.&quot;<br>
<br>
I cannot omit what happened to me while all this was acting; though it<br>
was cheerful work in the main, yet I trembled every joint of me, worse<br>
for aught I know than ever Belshazzar did at the handwriting on the<br>
wall, and the occasion was every way as just. &quot;Unhappy wretch,&quot; said I<br>
to myself, &quot;shall my ill-got wealth, the product of prosperous lust, and<br>
of a vile and vicious life of whoredom and adultery, be intermingled<br>
with the honest well-gotten estate of this innocent gentleman, to be a<br>
moth and a caterpillar among it, and bring the judgments of heaven upon<br>
him, and upon what he has, for my sake? Shall my wickedness blast his<br>
comforts? Shall I be fire in his flax? and be a means to provoke heaven<br>
to curse his blessings? God forbid! I'll keep them asunder if it be<br>
possible.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is the true reason why I have been so particular in the account of<br>
my vast acquired stock; and how his estate, which was perhaps the<br>
product of many years' fortunate industry, and which was equal if not<br>
superior to mine at best, was, at my request, kept apart from mine, as<br>
is mentioned above.<br>
<br>
I have told you how he gave back all my writings into my own hands<br>
again. &quot;Well,&quot; says I, &quot;seeing you will have it be kept apart, it shall<br>
be so, upon one condition, which I have to propose, and no other.&quot; &quot;And<br>
what is the condition?&quot; says he. &quot;Why,&quot; says I, &quot;all the pretence I can<br>
have for the making over my own estate to me is, that in case of your<br>
mortality, I may have it reserved for me, if I outlive you.&quot; &quot;Well,&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;that is true&quot; &quot;But then,&quot; said I, &quot;the annual income is always<br>
received by the husband, during his life, as 'tis supposed, for the<br>
mutual subsistence of the family; now,&quot; says I, &quot;here is &pound;2000 a year,<br>
which I believe is as much as we shall spend, and I desire none of it<br>
may be saved; and all the income of your own estate, the interest of the<br>
&pound;17,000 and the &pound;1320 a year, may be constantly laid by for the increase<br>
of your estate; and so,&quot; added I, &quot;by joining the interest every year to<br>
the capital you will perhaps grow as rich as you would do if you were to<br>
trade with it all, if you were obliged to keep house out of it too.&quot;<br>
<br>
He liked the proposal very well, and said it should be so; and this way<br>
I, in some measure, satisfied myself that I should not bring my husband<br>
under the blast of a just Providence, for mingling my cursed ill-gotten<br>
wealth with his honest estate. This was occasioned by the reflections<br>
which, at some certain intervals of time, came into my thoughts of the<br>
justice of heaven, which I had reason to expect would some time or other<br>
still fall upon me or my effects, for the dreadful life I had lived.<br>
<br>
And let nobody conclude from the strange success I met with in all my<br>
wicked doings, and the vast estate which I had raised by it, that<br>
therefore I either was happy or easy. No, no, there was a dart struck<br>
into the liver; there was a secret hell within, even all the while, when<br>
our joy was at the highest; but more especially now, after it was all<br>
over, and when, according to all appearance, I was one of the happiest<br>
women upon earth; all this while, I say, I had such constant terror upon<br>
my mind, as gave me every now and then very terrible shocks, and which<br>
made me expect something very frightful upon every accident of life.<br>
<br>
In a word, it never lightened or thundered, but I expected the next<br>
flash would penetrate my vitals, and melt the sword (soul) in this<br>
scabbard of flesh; it never blew a storm of wind, but I expected the<br>
fall of some stack of chimneys, or some part of the house, would bury me<br>
in its ruins; and so of other things.<br>
<br>
But I shall perhaps have occasion to speak of all these things again<br>
by-and-by; the case before us was in a manner settled; we had full four<br>
thousand pounds per annum for our future subsistence, besides a vast sum<br>
in jewels and plate; and besides this, I had about eight thousand pounds<br>
reserved in money which I kept back from him, to provide for my two<br>
daughters, of whom I have much yet to say.<br>
<br>
With this estate, settled as you have heard, and with the best husband<br>
in the world, I left England again; I had not only, in human prudence,<br>
and by the nature of the thing, being now married and settled in so<br>
glorious a manner,--I say, I had not only abandoned all the gay and<br>
wicked course which I had gone through before, but I began to look back<br>
upon it with that horror and that detestation which is the certain<br>
companion, if not the forerunner, of repentance.<br>
<br>
Sometimes the wonders of my present circumstances would work upon me,<br>
and I should have some raptures upon my soul, upon the subject of my<br>
coming so smoothly out of the arms of hell, that I was not ingulfed in<br>
ruin, as most who lead such lives are, first or last; but this was a<br>
flight too high for me; I was not come to that repentance that is raised<br>
from a sense of Heaven's goodness; I repented of the crime, but it was<br>
of another and lower kind of repentance, and rather moved by my fears of<br>
vengeance, than from a sense of being spared from being punished, and<br>
landed safe after a storm.<br>
<br>
The first thing which happened after our coming to the Hague (where we<br>
lodged for a while) was, that my spouse saluted me one morning with the<br>
title of countess, as he said he intended to do, by having the<br>
inheritance to which the honour was annexed made over to him. It is<br>
true, it was a reversion, but it soon fell, and in the meantime, as all<br>
the brothers of a count are called counts, so I had the title by<br>
courtesy, about three years before I had it in reality.<br>
<br>
I was agreeably surprised at this coming so soon, and would have had my<br>
spouse have taken the money which it cost him out of my stock, but he<br>
laughed at me, and went on.<br>
<br>
I was now in the height of my glory and prosperity, and I was called the<br>
Countess de ----; for I had obtained that unlooked for, which I secretly<br>
aimed at, and was really the main reason of my coming abroad. I took now<br>
more servants, lived in a kind of magnificence that I had not been<br>
acquainted with, was called &quot;your honour&quot; at every word, and had a<br>
coronet behind my coach; though at the same time I knew little or<br>
nothing of my new pedigree.<br>
<br>
The first thing that my spouse took upon him to manage, was to declare<br>
ourselves married eleven years before our arriving in Holland; and<br>
consequently to acknowledge our little son, who was yet in England, to<br>
be legitimate; order him to be brought over, and added to his family,<br>
and acknowledge him to be our own.<br>
<br>
This was done by giving notice to his people at Nimeguen, where his<br>
children (which were two sons and a daughter) were brought up, that he<br>
was come over from England, and that he was arrived at the Hague with<br>
his wife, and should reside there some time, and that he would have his<br>
two sons brought down to see him; which accordingly was done, and where<br>
I entertained them with all the kindness and tenderness that they could<br>
expect from their mother-in-law; and who pretended to be so ever since<br>
they were two or three years old.<br>
<br>
This supposing us to have been so long married was not difficult at all,<br>
in a country where we had been seen together about that time, viz.,<br>
eleven years and a half before, and where we had never been seen<br>
afterwards till we now returned together: this being seen together was<br>
also openly owned and acknowledged, of course, by our friend the<br>
merchant at Rotterdam, and also by the people in the house where we both<br>
lodged in the same city, and where our first intimacies began, and who,<br>
as it happened, were all alive; and therefore, to make it the more<br>
public, we made a tour to Rotterdam again, lodged in the same house, and<br>
was visited there by our friend the merchant, and afterwards invited<br>
frequently to his house, where he treated us very handsomely.<br>
<br>
This conduct of my spouse, and which he managed very cleverly, was<br>
indeed a testimony of a wonderful degree of honesty and affection to our<br>
little son; for it was done purely for the sake of the child.<br>
<br>
I call it an honest affection, because it was from a principle of<br>
honesty that he so earnestly concerned himself to prevent the scandal<br>
which would otherwise have fallen upon the child, who was itself<br>
innocent; and as it was from this principle of justice that he so<br>
earnestly solicited me, and conjured me by the natural affections of a<br>
mother, to marry him when it was yet young within me and unborn, that<br>
the child might not suffer for the sin of its father and mother; so,<br>
though at the same time he really loved me very well, yet I had reason<br>
to believe that it was from this principle of justice to the child that<br>
he came to England again to seek me with design to marry me, and, as he<br>
called it, save the innocent lamb from infamy worse than death.<br>
<br>
It was with a just reproach to myself that I must repeat it again, that<br>
I had not the same concern for it, though it was the child of my own<br>
body; nor had I ever the hearty affectionate love to the child that he<br>
had. What the reason of it was I cannot tell; and, indeed, I had shown a<br>
general neglect of the child through all the gay years of my London<br>
revels, except that I sent Amy to look upon it now and then, and to pay<br>
for its nursing; as for me, I scarce saw it four times in the first four<br>
years of its life, and often wished it would go quietly out of the<br>
world; whereas a son which I had by the jeweller, I took a different<br>
care of, and showed a different concern for, though I did not let him<br>
know me; for I provided very well for him, had him put out very well to<br>
school, and when he came to years fit for it, let him go over with a<br>
person of honesty and good business, to the Indies; and after he had<br>
lived there some time, and began to act for himself, sent him over the<br>
value of &pound;2000, at several times, with which he traded and grew rich;<br>
and, as 'tis to be hoped, may at last come over again with forty or<br>
fifty thousand pounds in his pocket, as many do who have not such<br>
encouragement at their beginning.<br>
<br>
I also sent him over a wife, a beautiful young lady, well-bred, an<br>
exceeding good-natured pleasant creature; but the nice young fellow did<br>
not like her, and had the impudence to write to me, that is, to the<br>
person I employed to correspond with him, to send him another, and<br>
promised that he would marry her I had sent him, to a friend of his, who<br>
liked her better than he did; but I took it so ill, that I would not<br>
send him another, and withal, stopped another article of &pound;1000 which I<br>
had appointed to send him. He considered of it afterwards, and offered<br>
to take her; but then truly she took so ill the first affront he put<br>
upon her, that she would not have him, and I sent him word I thought she<br>
was very much in the right. However, after courting her two years, and<br>
some friends interposing, she took him, and made him an excellent wife,<br>
as I knew she would, but I never sent him the thousand pounds cargo, so<br>
that he lost that money for misusing me, and took the lady at last<br>
without it.<br>
<br>
My new spouse and I lived a very regular, contemplative life; and, in<br>
itself, certainly a life filled with all human felicity. But if I looked<br>
upon my present situation with satisfaction, as I certainly did, so, in<br>
proportion, I on all occasions looked back on former things with<br>
detestation, and with the utmost affliction; and now, indeed, and not<br>
till now, those reflections began to prey upon my comforts, and lessen<br>
the sweets of my other enjoyments. They might be said to have gnawed a<br>
hole in my heart before; but now they made a hole quite through it: now<br>
they ate into all my pleasant things, made bitter every sweet, and mixed<br>
my sighs with every smile.<br>
<br>
Not all the affluence of a plentiful fortune; not a hundred thousand<br>
pounds estate (for, between us, we had little less); not honour and<br>
titles, attendants and equipages; in a word, not all the things we call<br>
pleasure, could give me any relish, or sweeten the taste of things to<br>
me; at least, not so much but I grew sad, heavy, pensive, and<br>
melancholy; slept little, and ate little; dreamed continually of the<br>
most frightful and terrible things imaginable: nothing but apparitions<br>
of devils and monsters, falling into gulfs, and off from steep and high<br>
precipices, and the like; so that in the morning, when I should rise,<br>
and be refreshed with the blessing of rest, I was hag-ridden with<br>
frights and terrible things formed merely in the imagination, and was<br>
either tired and wanted sleep, or overrun with vapours, and not fit for<br>
conversing with my family, or any one else.<br>
<br>
My husband, the tenderest creature in the world, and particularly so to<br>
me, was in great concern for me, and did everything that lay in his<br>
power to comfort and restore me; strove to reason me out of it; then<br>
tried all the ways possible to divert me: but it was all to no purpose,<br>
or to but very little.<br>
<br>
My only relief was sometimes to unbosom myself to poor Amy, when she and<br>
I was alone; and she did all she could to comfort me. But all was to<br>
little effect there; for, though Amy was the better penitent before,<br>
when we had been in the storm, Amy was just where she used to be now, a<br>
wild, gay, loose wretch, and not much the graver for her age; for Amy<br>
was between forty and fifty by this time too.<br>
<br>
But to go on with my own story. As I had no comforter, so I had no<br>
counsellor; it was well, as I often thought, that I was not a Roman<br>
Catholic; for what a piece of work should I have made, to have gone to a<br>
priest with such a history as I had to tell him; and what penance would<br>
any father confessor have obliged me to perform, especially if he had<br>
been honest, and true to his office!<br>
<br>
However, as I had none of the recourse, so I had none of the absolution,<br>
by which the criminal confessing goes away comforted; but I went about<br>
with a heart loaded with crime, and altogether in the dark as to what I<br>
was to do; and in this condition I languished near two years. I may well<br>
call it languishing, for if Providence had not relieved me, I should<br>
have died in little time. But of that hereafter.<br>
<br>
I must now go back to another scene, and join it to this end of my<br>
story, which will complete all my concern with England, at least all<br>
that I shall bring into this account.<br>
<br>
I have hinted at large what I had done for my two sons, one at Messina,<br>
and the other in the Indies; but I have not gone through the story of my<br>
two daughters. I was so in danger of being known by one of them, that I<br>
durst not see her, so as to let her know who I was; and for the other, I<br>
could not well know how to see her, and own her, and let her see me,<br>
because she must then know that I would not let her sister know me,<br>
which would look strange; so that, upon the whole, I resolved to see<br>
neither of them at all. But Amy managed all that for me; and when she<br>
had made gentlewomen of them both, by giving them a good, though late<br>
education, she had like to have blown up the whole case, and herself and<br>
me too, by an unhappy discovery of herself to the last of them, that is,<br>
to her who was our cook-maid, and who, as I said before, Amy had been<br>
obliged to turn away, for fear of the very discovery which now happened.<br>
I have observed already in what manner Amy managed her by a third<br>
person; and how the girl, when she was set up for a lady, as above, came<br>
and visited Amy at my lodgings; after which, Amy going, as was her<br>
custom, to see the girl's brother (my son) at the honest man's house in<br>
Spitalfields, both the girls were there, merely by accident, at the same<br>
time; and the other girl unawares discovered the secret, namely, that<br>
this was the lady that had done all this for them.<br>
<br>
Amy was greatly surprised at it; but as she saw there was no remedy, she<br>
made a jest of it, and so after that conversed openly, being still<br>
satisfied that neither of them could make much of it, as long as they<br>
knew nothing of me. So she took them together one time, and told them<br>
the history, as she called it, of their mother, beginning at the<br>
miserable carrying them to their aunt's; she owned she was not their<br>
mother herself, but described her to them. However, when she said she<br>
was not their mother, one of them expressed herself very much surprised,<br>
for the girl had taken up a strong fancy that Amy was really her mother,<br>
and that she had, for some particular reasons, concealed it from her;<br>
and therefore, when she told her frankly that she was not her mother,<br>
the girl fell a-crying, and Amy had much ado to keep life in her. This<br>
was the girl who was at first my cook-maid in the Pall Mall. When Amy<br>
had brought her to again a little, and she had recovered her first<br>
disorder, Amy asked what ailed her? The poor girl hung about her, and<br>
kissed her, and was in such a passion still, though she was a great<br>
wench of nineteen or twenty years old, that she could not be brought to<br>
speak a great while. At last, having recovered her speech, she said<br>
still, &quot;But oh! Do not say you a'n't my mother! I'm sure you are my<br>
mother;&quot; and then the girl cried again like to kill herself. Amy could<br>
not tell what to do with her a good while; she was loth to say again she<br>
was not her mother, because she would not throw her into a fit of<br>
crying again; but she went round about a little with her. &quot;Why, child,&quot;<br>
says she, &quot;why would you have me be your mother? If it be because I am<br>
so kind to you, be easy, my dear,&quot; says Amy; &quot;I'll be as kind to you<br>
still, as if I was your mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, but,&quot; says the girl, &quot;I am sure you are my mother too; and what<br>
have I done that you won't own me, and that you will not be called my<br>
mother? Though I am poor, you have made me a gentlewoman,&quot; says she,<br>
&quot;and I won't do anything to disgrace you; besides,&quot; added she, &quot;I can<br>
keep a secret, too, especially for my own mother, sure;&quot; then she calls<br>
Amy her dear mother, and hung about her neck again, crying still<br>
vehemently.<br>
<br>
This last part of the girl's words alarmed Amy, and, as she told me,<br>
frighted her terribly; nay, she was so confounded with it, that she was<br>
not able to govern herself, or to conceal her disorder from the girl<br>
herself, as you shall hear. Amy was at a full stop, and confused to the<br>
last degree; and the girl, a sharp jade, turned it upon her. &quot;My dear<br>
mother,&quot; says she, &quot;do not be uneasy about it; I know it all; but do not<br>
be uneasy, I won't let my sister know a word of it, or my brother<br>
either, without you giving me leave; but don't disown me now you have<br>
found me; don't hide yourself from me any longer; I can't bear that,&quot;<br>
says she, &quot;it will break my heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I think the girl's mad,&quot; says Amy; &quot;why, child, I tell thee, if I was<br>
thy mother I would not disown thee; don't you see I am as kind to you<br>
as if I was your mother?&quot; Amy might as well have sung a song to a<br>
kettledrum, as talk to her. &quot;Yes,&quot; says the girl, &quot;you are very good to<br>
me indeed;&quot; and that was enough to make anybody believe she was her<br>
mother too; but, however, that was not the case, she had other reasons<br>
to believe, and to know, that she was her mother; and it was a sad thing<br>
she would not let her call her mother, who was her own child.<br>
<br>
Amy was so heart-full with the disturbance of it, that she did not enter<br>
farther with her into the inquiry, as she would otherwise have done; I<br>
mean, as to what made the girl so positive; but comes away, and tells me<br>
the whole story.<br>
<br>
I was thunderstruck with the story at first, and much more afterwards,<br>
as you shall hear; but, I say, I was thunderstruck at first, and amazed,<br>
and said to Amy, &quot;There must be something or other in it more than we<br>
know of.&quot; But, having examined farther into it, I found the girl had no<br>
notion of anybody but of Amy; and glad I was that I was not concerned in<br>
the pretence, and that the girl had no notion of me in it. But even this<br>
easiness did not continue long; for the next time Amy went to see her,<br>
she was the same thing, and rather more violent with Amy than she was<br>
before. Amy endeavoured to pacify her by all the ways imaginable: first,<br>
she told her she took it ill that she would not believe her; and told<br>
her, if she would not give over such a foolish whimsey, she would leave<br>
her to the wide world as she found her.<br>
<br>
This put the girl into fits, and she cried ready to kill herself, and<br>
hung about Amy again like a child. &quot;Why,&quot; says Amy, &quot;why can you not be<br>
easy with me, then, and compose yourself, and let me go on to do you<br>
good, and show you kindness, as I would do, and as I intend to do? Can<br>
you think that if I was your mother, I would not tell you so? What<br>
whimsey is this that possesses your mind?&quot; says Amy. Well, the girl told<br>
her in a few words (but those few such as frighted Amy out of her wits,<br>
and me too) that she knew well enough how it was. &quot;I know,&quot; says she,<br>
&quot;when you left ----,&quot; naming the village, &quot;where I lived when my father<br>
went away from us all, that you went over to France; I know that too,<br>
and who you went with,&quot; says the girl; &quot;did not my Lady Roxana come back<br>
again with you? I know it all well enough; though I was but a child, I<br>
have heard it all.&quot; And thus she run on with such discourse as put Amy<br>
out of all temper again; and she raved at her like a bedlam, and told<br>
her she would never come near her any more; she might go a-begging again<br>
if she would; she'd have nothing to do with her. The girl, a passionate<br>
wench, told her she knew the worst of it, she could go to service again,<br>
and if she would not own her own child, she must do as she pleased; then<br>
she fell into a passion of crying again, as if she would kill herself.<br>
<br>
In short, this girl's conduct terrified Amy to the last degree, and me<br>
too; and was it not that we knew the girl was quite wrong in some<br>
things, she was yet so right in some other, that it gave me a great deal<br>
of perplexity; but that which put Amy the most to it, was that the girl<br>
(my daughter) told her that she (meaning me, her mother) had gone away<br>
with the jeweller, and into France too; she did not call him the<br>
jeweller, but with the landlord of the house; who, after her mother fell<br>
into distress, and that Amy had taken all the children from her, made<br>
much of her, and afterwards married her.<br>
<br>
In short, it was plain the girl had but a broken account of things, but<br>
yet that she had received some accounts that had a reality in the bottom<br>
of them, so that, it seems, our first measures, and the amour with the<br>
jeweller, were not so concealed as I thought they had been; and, it<br>
seems, came in a broken manner to my sister-in-law, who Amy carried the<br>
children to, and she made some bustle, it seems, about it. But, as good<br>
luck was, it was too late, and I was removed and gone, none knew<br>
whither, or else she would have sent all the children home to me again,<br>
to be sure.<br>
<br>
This we picked out of the girl's discourse, that is to say, Amy did, at<br>
several times; but it all consisted of broken fragments of stories, such<br>
as the girl herself had heard so long ago, that she herself could make<br>
very little of it; only that in the main, that her mother had played the<br>
whore; had gone away with the gentleman that was landlord of the house;<br>
that he married her; that she went into France. And, as she had learned<br>
in my family, where she was a servant, that Mrs. Amy and her Lady Roxana<br>
had been in France together, so she put all these things together, and<br>
joining them with the great kindness that Amy now showed her, possessed<br>
the creature that Amy was really her mother, nor was it possible for Amy<br>
to conquer it for a long time.<br>
<br>
But this, after I had searched into it, as far as by Amy's relation I<br>
could get an account of it, did not disquiet me half so much as that the<br>
young slut had got the name of Roxana by the end, and that she knew who<br>
her Lady Roxana was, and the like; though this, neither, did not hang<br>
together, for then she would not have fixed upon Amy for her mother. But<br>
some time after, when Amy had almost persuaded her out of it, and that<br>
the girl began to be so confounded in her discourses of it, that she<br>
made neither head nor tail, at last the passionate creature flew out in<br>
a kind of rage, and said to Amy, that if she was not her mother, Madam<br>
Roxana was her mother then, for one of them, she was sure, was her<br>
mother; and then all this that Amy had done for her was by Madam<br>
Roxana's order. &quot;And I am sure,&quot; says she, &quot;it was my Lady Roxana's<br>
coach that brought the gentlewoman, whoever it was, to my uncle's in<br>
Spitalfields, for the coachman told me so.&quot; Amy fell a-laughing at her<br>
aloud, as was her usual way; but, as Amy told me, it was but on one<br>
side of her mouth, for she was so confounded at her discourse, that she<br>
was ready to sink into the ground; and so was I too when she told it me.<br>
<br>
However, Amy brazened her out of it all; told her, &quot;Well, since you<br>
think you are so high-born as to be my Lady Roxana's daughter, you may<br>
go to her and claim your kindred, can't you? I suppose,&quot; says Amy, &quot;you<br>
know where to find her?&quot; She said she did not question to find her, for<br>
she knew where she was gone to live privately; but, though, she might be<br>
removed again. &quot;For I know how it is,&quot; says she, with a kind of a smile<br>
or a grin; &quot;I know how it all is, well enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy was so provoked, that she told me, in short, she began to think it<br>
would be absolutely necessary to murder her. That expression filled me<br>
with horror, all my blood ran chill in my veins, and a fit of trembling<br>
seized me, that I could not speak a good while; at last. &quot;What, is the<br>
devil in you, Amy?&quot; said I. &quot;Nay, nay,&quot; says she, &quot;let it be the devil<br>
or not the devil, if I thought she knew one tittle of your history, I<br>
would despatch her if she were my own daughter a thousand times.&quot; &quot;And<br>
I,&quot; says I in a rage, &quot;as well as I love you, would be the first that<br>
should put the halter about your neck, and see you hanged with more<br>
satisfaction than ever I saw you in my life; nay,&quot; says I, &quot;you would<br>
not live to be hanged, I believe I should cut your throat with my own<br>
hand; I am almost ready to do it,&quot; said I, &quot;as 'tis, for your but<br>
naming the thing.&quot; With that, I called her cursed devil, and bade her<br>
get out of the room.<br>
<br>
I think it was the first time that ever I was angry with Amy in all my<br>
life; and when all was done, though she was a devilish jade in having<br>
such a thought, yet it was all of it the effect of her excess of<br>
affection and fidelity to me.<br>
<br>
But this thing gave me a terrible shock, for it happened just after I<br>
was married, and served to hasten my going over to Holland; for I would<br>
not have been seen, so as to be known by the name of Roxana, no, not for<br>
ten thousand pounds; it would have been enough to have ruined me to all<br>
intents and purposes with my husband, and everybody else too; I might as<br>
well have been the &quot;German princess.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I set Amy to work; and give Amy her due, she set all her wits to<br>
work to find out which way this girl had her knowledge, but, more<br>
particularly, how much knowledge she had--that is to say, what she<br>
really knew, and what she did not know, for this was the main thing with<br>
me; how she could say she knew who Madam Roxana was, and what notions<br>
she had of that affair, was very mysterious to me, for it was certain<br>
she could not have a right notion of me, because she would have it be<br>
that Amy was her mother.<br>
<br>
I scolded heartily at Amy for letting the girl ever know her, that is to<br>
say, know her in this affair; for that she knew her could not be hid,<br>
because she, as I might say, served Amy, or rather under Amy, in my<br>
family, as is said before; but she (Amy) talked with her at first by<br>
another person, and not by herself; and that secret came out by an<br>
accident, as I have said above.<br>
<br>
Amy was concerned at it as well as I, but could not help it; and though<br>
it gave us great uneasiness, yet, as there was no remedy, we were bound<br>
to make as little noise of it as we could, that it might go no farther.<br>
I bade Amy punish the girl for it, and she did so, for she parted with<br>
her in a huff, and told her she should see she was not her mother, for<br>
that she could leave her just where she found her; and seeing she could<br>
not be content to be served by the kindness of a friend, but that she<br>
would needs make a mother of her, she would, for the future, be neither<br>
mother or friend, and so bid her go to service again, and be a drudge as<br>
she was before.<br>
<br>
The poor girl cried most lamentably, but would not be beaten out of it<br>
still; but that which dumbfoundered Amy more than all the rest was that<br>
when she had berated the poor girl a long time, and could not beat her out<br>
of it, and had, as I have observed, threatened to leave her, the girl<br>
kept to what she said before, and put this turn to it again, that she<br>
was sure, if Amy wa'n't, my Lady Roxana was her mother, and that she<br>
would go find her out; adding, that she made no doubt but she could do<br>
it, for she knew where to inquire the name of her new husband.<br>
<br>
Amy came home with this piece of news in her mouth to me. I could easily<br>
perceive when she came in that she was mad in her mind, and in a rage at<br>
something or other, and was in great pain to get it out; for when she<br>
came first in, my husband was in the room. However, Amy going up to<br>
undress her, I soon made an excuse to follow her, and coming into the<br>
room, &quot;What the d--l is the matter, Amy?&quot; says I; &quot;I am sure you have<br>
some bad news.&quot; &quot;News,&quot; says Amy aloud; &quot;ay, so I have; I think the d--l<br>
is in that young wench. She'll ruin us all and herself too; there's no<br>
quieting her.&quot; So she went on and told me all the particulars; but sure<br>
nothing was so astonished as I was when she told me that the girl knew I<br>
was married, that she knew my husband's name, and would endeavour to<br>
find me out. I thought I should have sunk down at the very words. In the<br>
middle of all my amazement, Amy starts up and runs about the room like a<br>
distracted body. &quot;I must put an end to it, that I will; I can't bear<br>
it--I must murder her, I'll kill the b----;&quot; and swears by her Maker, in<br>
the most serious tone in the world, and then repeated it over three or<br>
four times, walking to and again in the room. &quot;I will, in short, I will<br>
kill her, if there was not another wench in the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Prithee hold thy tongue, Amy,&quot; says I; &quot;why, thou art mad.&quot; &quot;Ay, so I<br>
am,&quot; says she, &quot;stark mad; but I'll be the death of her for all that,<br>
and then I shall be sober again.&quot; &quot;But you sha'n't,&quot; says I, &quot;you<br>
sha'n't hurt a hair of her head; why, you ought to be hanged for what<br>
you have done already, for having resolved on it is doing it; as to the<br>
guilt of the fact you are a murderer already, as much as if you had done<br>
it already.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know that,&quot; says Amy, &quot;and it can be no worse; I'll put you out of<br>
your pain, and her too; she shall never challenge you for her mother in<br>
this world, whatever she may in the next.&quot; &quot;Well, well,&quot; says I, &quot;be<br>
quiet, and do not talk thus, I can't bear it.&quot; So she grew a little<br>
soberer after a while.<br>
<br>
I must acknowledge, the notion of being discovered carried with it so<br>
many frightful ideas, and hurried my thoughts so much, that I was scarce<br>
myself any more than Amy, so dreadful a thing is a load of guilt upon<br>
the mind.<br>
<br>
And yet when Amy began the second time to talk thus abominably of<br>
killing the poor child, of murdering her, and swore by her Maker that<br>
she would, so that I began to see that she was in earnest, I was farther<br>
terrified a great deal, and it helped to bring me to myself again in<br>
other cases.<br>
<br>
We laid our heads together then to see if it was possible to discover by<br>
what means she had learned to talk so, and how she (I mean my girl) came<br>
to know that her mother had married a husband; but it would not do, the<br>
girl would acknowledge nothing, and gave but a very imperfect account of<br>
things still, being disgusted to the last degree with Amy's leaving her<br>
so abruptly as she did.<br>
<br>
Well, Amy went to the house where the boy was; but it was all one, there<br>
they had only heard a confused story of the lady somebody, they knew not<br>
who, which the same wench had told them, but they gave no heed to it at<br>
all. Amy told them how foolishly the girl had acted, and how she had<br>
carried on the whimsey so far, in spite of all they could say to her;<br>
that she had taken it so ill, she would see her no more, and so she<br>
might e'en go to service again if she would, for she (Amy) would have<br>
nothing to do with her unless she humbled herself and changed her note,<br>
and that quickly too.<br>
<br>
The good old gentleman, who had been the benefactor to them all, was<br>
greatly concerned at it, and the good woman his wife was grieved beyond<br>
all expressing, and begged her ladyship (meaning Amy), not to resent it;<br>
they promised, too, they would talk with her about it, and the old<br>
gentlewoman added, with some astonishment, &quot;Sure she cannot be such a<br>
fool but she will be prevailed with to hold her tongue, when she has it<br>
from your own mouth that you are not her mother, and sees that it<br>
disobliges your ladyship to have her insist upon it.&quot; And so Amy came<br>
away with some expectation that it would be stopped here.<br>
<br>
But the girl was such a fool for all that, and persisted in it<br>
obstinately, notwithstanding all they could say to her; nay, her sister<br>
begged and entreated her not to play the fool, for that it would ruin<br>
her too, and that the lady (meaning Amy) would abandon them both.<br>
<br>
Well, notwithstanding this, she insisted, I say, upon it, and which was<br>
worse, the longer it lasted the more she began to drop Amy's ladyship,<br>
and would have it that the Lady Roxana was her mother, and that she had<br>
made some inquiries about it, and did not doubt but she should find her<br>
out.<br>
<br>
When it was come to this, and we found there was nothing to be done with<br>
the girl, but that she was so obstinately bent upon the search after me,<br>
that she ventured to forfeit all she had in view; I say, when I found it<br>
was come to this, I began to be more serious in my preparations of my<br>
going beyond sea, and particularly, it gave me some reason to fear that<br>
there was something in it. But the following accident put me beside all<br>
my measures, and struck me into the greatest confusion that ever I was<br>
in my life.<br>
<br>
I was so near going abroad that my spouse and I had taken measures for<br>
our going off; and because I would be sure not to go too public, but so<br>
as to take away all possibility of being seen, I had made some exception<br>
to my spouse against going in the ordinary public passage boats. My<br>
pretence to him was the promiscuous crowds in those vessels, want of<br>
convenience, and the like. So he took the hint, and found me out an<br>
English merchant-ship, which was bound for Rotterdam, and getting soon<br>
acquainted with the master, he hired his whole ship, that is to say, his<br>
great cabin, for I do not mean his ship for freight, that so we had all<br>
the conveniences possible for our passage; and all things being near<br>
ready, he brought home the captain one day to dinner with him, that I<br>
might see him, and be acquainted a little with him. So we came after<br>
dinner to talk of the ship and the conveniences on board, and the<br>
captain pressed me earnestly to come on board and see the ship,<br>
intimating that he would treat us as well as he could; and in discourse<br>
I happened to say I hoped he had no other passengers. He said no, he had<br>
not; but, he said, his wife had courted him a good while to let her go<br>
over to Holland with him, for he always used that trade, but he never<br>
could think of venturing all he had in one bottom; but if I went with<br>
him he thought to take her and her kinswoman along with him this voyage,<br>
that they might both wait upon me; and so added, that if we would do him<br>
the honour to dine on board the next day, he would bring his wife on<br>
board, the better to make us welcome.<br>
<br>
Who now could have believed the devil had any snare at the bottom of all<br>
this? or that I was in any danger on such an occasion, so remote and out<br>
of the way as this was? But the event was the oddest that could be<br>
thought of. As it happened, Amy was not at home when we accepted this<br>
invitation, and so she was left out of the company; but instead of Amy,<br>
we took our honest, good-humoured, never-to-be-omitted friend the<br>
Quaker, one of the best creatures that ever lived, sure; and who,<br>
besides a thousand good qualities unmixed with one bad one, was<br>
particularly excellent for being the best company in the world; though<br>
I think I had carried Amy too, if she had not been engaged in this<br>
unhappy girl's affair. For on a sudden the girl was lost, and no news<br>
was to be heard of her; and Amy had haunted her to every place she could<br>
think of, that it was likely to find her in; but all the news she could<br>
hear of her was, that she was gone to an old comrade's house of hers,<br>
which she called sister, and who was married to a master of a ship, who<br>
lived at Redriff; and even this the jade never told me. It seems, when<br>
this girl was directed by Amy to get her some breeding, go to the<br>
boarding-school, and the like, she was recommended to a boarding-school<br>
at Camberwell, and there she contracted an acquaintance with a young<br>
lady (so they are all called), her bedfellow, that they called sisters,<br>
and promised never to break off their acquaintance.<br>
<br>
But judge you what an unaccountable surprise I must be in when I came on<br>
board the ship and was brought into the captain's cabin, or what they<br>
call it, the great cabin of the ship, to see his lady or wife, and<br>
another young person with her, who, when I came to see her near hand,<br>
was my old cook-maid in the Pall Mall, and, as appeared by the sequel of<br>
the story, was neither more or less than my own daughter. That I knew<br>
her was out of doubt; for though she had not had opportunity to see me<br>
very often, yet I had often seen her, as I must needs, being in my own<br>
family so long.<br>
<br>
If ever I had need of courage, and a full presence of mind, it was now;<br>
it was the only valuable secret in the world to me, all depended upon<br>
this occasion; if the girl knew me, I was undone; and to discover any<br>
surprise or disorder had been to make her know me, or guess it, and<br>
discover herself.<br>
<br>
I was once going to feign a swooning and fainting away, and so falling<br>
on the ground, or floor, put them all into a hurry and fright, and by<br>
that means to get an opportunity to be continually holding something to<br>
my nose to smell to, and so hold my hand or my handkerchief, or both,<br>
before my mouth; then pretend I could not bear the smell of the ship, or<br>
the closeness of the cabin. But that would have been only to remove into<br>
a clearer air upon the quarter-deck, where we should, with it, have had<br>
a clearer light too; and if I had pretended the smell of the ship, it<br>
would have served only to have carried us all on shore to the captain's<br>
house, which was hard by; for the ship lay so close to the shore, that<br>
we only walked over a plank to go on board, and over another ship which<br>
lay within her; so this not appearing feasible, and the thought not<br>
being two minutes old, there was no time, for the two ladies rose up,<br>
and we saluted, so that I was bound to come so near my girl as to kiss<br>
her, which I would not have done had it been possible to have avoided<br>
it, but there was no room to escape.<br>
<br>
I cannot but take notice here, that notwithstanding there was a secret<br>
horror upon my mind, and I was ready to sink when I came close to her to<br>
salute her, yet it was a secret inconceivable pleasure to me when I<br>
kissed her, to know that I kissed my own child, my own flesh and blood,<br>
born of my body, and who I had never kissed since I took the fatal<br>
farewell of them all, with a million of tears, and a heart almost dead<br>
with grief, when Amy and the good woman took them all away, and went<br>
with them to Spitalfields. No pen can describe, no words can express, I<br>
say, the strange impression which this thing made upon my spirits. I<br>
felt something shoot through my blood, my heart fluttered, my head<br>
flashed, and was dizzy, and all within me, as I thought, turned about,<br>
and much ado I had not to abandon myself to an excess of passion at the<br>
first sight of her, much more when my lips touched her face. I thought I<br>
must have taken her in my arms and kissed her again a thousand times,<br>
whether I would or no.<br>
<br>
But I roused up my judgment, and shook it off, and with infinite<br>
uneasiness in my mind, I sat down. You will not wonder if upon this<br>
surprise I was not conversable for some minutes, and that the disorder<br>
had almost discovered itself. I had a complication of severe things upon<br>
me, I could not conceal my disorder without the utmost difficulty, and<br>
yet upon my concealing it depended the whole of my prosperity; so I used<br>
all manner of violence with myself to prevent the mischief which was at<br>
the door.<br>
<br>
Well, I saluted her, but as I went first forward to the captain's lady,<br>
who was at the farther end of the cabin, towards the light, I had the<br>
occasion offered to stand with my back to the light, when I turned<br>
about to her, who stood more on my left hand, so that she had not a fair<br>
sight of me, though I was so near her. I trembled, and knew neither what<br>
I did or said, I was in the utmost extremity, between so many particular<br>
circumstances as lay upon me, for I was to conceal my disorder from<br>
everybody at the utmost peril, and at the same time expected everybody<br>
would discern it. I was to expect she would discover that she knew me,<br>
and yet was, by all means possible, to prevent it. I was to conceal<br>
myself, if possible, and yet had not the least room to do anything<br>
towards it. In short, there was no retreat, no shifting anything off, no<br>
avoiding or preventing her having a full sight of me, nor was there any<br>
counterfeiting my voice, for then my husband would have perceived it. In<br>
short, there was not the least circumstance that offered me any<br>
assistance, or any favourable thing to help me in this exigence.<br>
<br>
After I had been upon the rack for near half-an-hour, during which I<br>
appeared stiff and reserved, and a little too formal, my spouse and the<br>
captain fell into discourses about the ship and the sea, and business<br>
remote from us women; and by-and-by the captain carried him out upon the<br>
quarter-deck, and left us all by ourselves in the great cabin. Then we<br>
began to be a little freer one with another, and I began to be a little<br>
revived by a sudden fancy of my own--namely, I thought I perceived that<br>
the girl did not know me, and the chief reason of my having such a<br>
notion was because I did not perceive the least disorder in her<br>
countenance, or the least change in her carriage, no confusion, no<br>
hesitation in her discourse; nor, which I had my eye particularly upon,<br>
did I observe that she fixed her eyes much upon me, that is to say, not<br>
singling me out to look steadily at me, as I thought would have been the<br>
case, but that she rather singled out my friend the Quaker, and chatted<br>
with her on several things; but I observed, too, that it was all about<br>
indifferent matters.<br>
<br>
This greatly encouraged me, and I began to be a little cheerful; but I<br>
was knocked down again as with a thunderclap, when turning to the<br>
captain's wife, and discoursing of me, she said to her, &quot;Sister, I<br>
cannot but think my lady to be very much like such a person.&quot; Then she<br>
named the person, and the captain's wife said she thought so too. The<br>
girl replied again, she was sure she had seen me before, but she could<br>
not recollect where; I answered (though her speech was not directed to<br>
me) that I fancied she had not seen me before in England, but asked if<br>
she had lived in Holland. She said, No, no, she had never been out of<br>
England, and I added, that she could not then have known me in England,<br>
unless it was very lately, for I had lived at Rotterdam a great while.<br>
This carried me out of that part of the broil pretty well, and to make<br>
it go off better, when a little Dutch boy came into the cabin, who<br>
belonged to the captain, and who I easily perceived to be Dutch, I<br>
jested and talked Dutch to him, and was merry about the boy, that is to<br>
say, as merry as the consternation I was still in would let me be.<br>
<br>
However, I began to be thoroughly convinced by this time that the girl<br>
did not know me, which was an infinite satisfaction to me, or, at least,<br>
that though she had some notion of me, yet that she did not think<br>
anything about my being who I was, and which, perhaps, she would have<br>
been as glad to have known as I would have been surprised if she had;<br>
indeed, it was evident that, had she suspected anything of the truth,<br>
she would not have been able to have concealed it.<br>
<br>
Thus this meeting went off, and, you may be sure, I was resolved, if<br>
once I got off of it, she should never see me again to revive her fancy;<br>
but I was mistaken there too, as you shall hear. After we had been on<br>
board, the captain's lady carried us home to her house, which was but<br>
just on shore, and treated us there again very handsomely, and made us<br>
promise that we would come again and see her before we went to concert<br>
our affairs for the voyage and the like, for she assured us that both<br>
she and her sister went the voyage at that time for our company, and I<br>
thought to myself, &quot;Then you'll never go the voyage at all;&quot; for I saw<br>
from that moment that it would be no way convenient for my ladyship to<br>
go with them, for that frequent conversation might bring me to her mind,<br>
and she would certainly claim her kindred to me in a few days, as indeed<br>
would have been the case.<br>
<br>
It is hardly possible for me to conceive what would have been our part<br>
in this affair had my woman Amy gone with me on board this ship; it had<br>
certainly blown up the whole affair, and I must for ever after have been<br>
this girl's vassal, that is to say, have let her into the secret, and<br>
trusted to her keeping it too, or have been exposed and undone. The very<br>
thought filled me with horror.<br>
<br>
But I was not so unhappy neither, as it fell out, for Amy was not with<br>
us, and that was my deliverance indeed; yet we had another chance to get<br>
over still. As I resolved to put off the voyage, so I resolved to put<br>
off the visit, you may be sure, going upon this principle, namely, that<br>
I was fixed in it that the girl had seen her last of me, and should<br>
never see me more.<br>
<br>
However, to bring myself well off, and, withal, to see, if I could, a<br>
little farther into the matter, I sent my friend the Quaker to the<br>
captain's lady to make the visit promised, and to make my excuse that I<br>
could not possibly wait on her, for that I was very much out of order;<br>
and in the end of the discourse I bade her insinuate to them that she<br>
was afraid I should not be able to get ready to go the voyage as soon as<br>
the captain would be obliged to go, and that perhaps we might put it off<br>
to his next voyage. I did not let the Quaker into any other reason for<br>
it than that I was indisposed; and not knowing what other face to put<br>
upon that part, I made her believe that I thought I was a-breeding.<br>
<br>
It was easy to put that into her head, and she of course hinted to the<br>
captain's lady that she found me so very ill that she was afraid I would<br>
miscarry, and then, to be sure, I could not think of going.<br>
<br>
She went, and she managed that part very dexterously, as I knew she<br>
would, though she knew not a word of the grand reason of my<br>
indisposition; but I was all sunk and dead-hearted again when she told<br>
me she could not understand the meaning of one thing in her visit,<br>
namely, that the young woman, as she called her, that was with the<br>
captain's lady, and who she called sister, was most impertinently<br>
inquisitive into things; as who I was? how long I had been in England?<br>
where I had lived? and the like; and that, above all the rest, she<br>
inquired if I did not live once at the other end of the town.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought her inquiries so out of the way,&quot; says the honest Quaker,<br>
&quot;that I gave her not the least satisfaction; but as I saw by thy answers<br>
on board the ship, when she talked of thee, that thou didst not incline<br>
to let her be acquainted with thee, so I was resolved that she should<br>
not be much the wiser for me; and when she asked me if thou ever<br>
lived'st here or there, I always said, No, but that thou wast a Dutch<br>
lady, and was going home again to thy family, and lived abroad.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thanked her very heartily for that part, and indeed she served me in<br>
it more than I let her know she did: in a word, she thwarted the girl so<br>
cleverly, that if she had known the whole affair she could not have<br>
done it better.<br>
<br>
But, I must acknowledge, all this put me upon the rack again, and I was<br>
quite discouraged, not at all doubting but that the jade had a right<br>
scent of things, and that she knew and remembered my face, but had<br>
artfully concealed her knowledge of me till she might perhaps do it more<br>
to my disadvantage. I told all this to Amy, for she was all the relief I<br>
had. The poor soul (Amy) was ready to hang herself, that, as she said,<br>
she had been the occasion of it all; and that if I was ruined (which was<br>
the word I always used to her), she had ruined me; and she tormented<br>
herself about it so much, that I was sometimes fain to comfort her and<br>
myself too.<br>
<br>
What Amy vexed herself at was, chiefly, that she should be surprised so<br>
by the girl, as she called her; I mean surprised into a discovery of<br>
herself to the girl; which indeed was a false step of Amy's, and so I<br>
had often told her. But it was to no purpose to talk of that now, the<br>
business was, how to get clear of the girl's suspicions, and of the girl<br>
too, for it looked more threatening every day than other; and if I was<br>
uneasy at what Amy had told me of her rambling and rattling to her<br>
(Amy), I had a thousand times as much reason to be uneasy now, when she<br>
had chopped upon me so unhappily as this; and not only had seen my face,<br>
but knew too where I lived, what name I went by, and the like.<br>
<br>
And I am not come to the worst of it yet neither, for a few days after<br>
my friend the Quaker had made her visit, and excused me on the account<br>
of indisposition, as if they had done it in over and above kindness,<br>
because they had been told I was not well, they come both directly to my<br>
lodgings to visit me: the captain's wife and my daughter (who she called<br>
sister), and the captain, to show them the place; the captain only<br>
brought them to the door, put them in, and went away upon some business.<br>
<br>
Had not the kind Quaker, in a lucky moment, come running in before them,<br>
they had not only clapped in upon me, in the parlour, as it had been a<br>
surprise, but which would have been a thousand times worse, had seen Amy<br>
with me; I think if that had happened, I had had no remedy but to take<br>
the girl by herself, and have made myself known to her, which would have<br>
been all distraction.<br>
<br>
But the Quaker, a lucky creature to me, happened to see them come to the<br>
door, before they rung the bell, and instead of going to let them in,<br>
came running in with some confusion in her countenance, and told me who<br>
was a-coming; at which Amy run first and I after her, and bid the Quaker<br>
come up as soon as she had let them in.<br>
<br>
I was going to bid her deny me, but it came into my thoughts, that<br>
having been represented so much out of order, it would have looked very<br>
odd; besides, I knew the honest Quaker, though she would do anything<br>
else for me, would not lie for me, and it would have been hard to have<br>
desired it of her.<br>
<br>
After she had let them in, and brought them into the parlour, she came<br>
up to Amy and I, who were hardly out of the fright, and yet were<br>
congratulating one another that Amy was not surprised again.<br>
<br>
They paid their visit in form, and I received them as formally, but took<br>
occasion two or three times to hint that I was so ill that I was afraid<br>
I should not be able to go to Holland, at least not so soon as the<br>
captain must go off; and made my compliment how sorry I was to be<br>
disappointed of the advantage of their company and assistance in the<br>
voyage; and sometimes I talked as if I thought I might stay till the<br>
captain returned, and would be ready to go again; then the Quaker put<br>
in, that then I might be too far gone, meaning with child, that I should<br>
not venture at all; and then (as if she should be pleased with it)<br>
added, she hoped I would stay and lie in at her house; so as this<br>
carried its own face with it, 'twas well enough.<br>
<br>
But it was now high time to talk of this to my husband, which, however,<br>
was not the greatest difficulty before me; for after this and other chat<br>
had taken up some time, the young fool began her tattle again; and two<br>
or three times she brought it in, that I was so like a lady that she had<br>
the honour to know at the other end of the town, that she could not put<br>
that lady out of her mind when I was by, and once or twice I fancied the<br>
girl was ready to cry; by and by she was at it again, and at last I<br>
plainly saw tears in her eyes; upon which I asked her if the lady was<br>
dead, because she seemed to be in some concern for her. She made me much<br>
easier by her answer than ever she did before; she said she did not<br>
really know, but she believed she was dead.<br>
<br>
This, I say, a little relieved my thoughts, but I was soon down again;<br>
for, after some time, the jade began to grow talkative; and as it was<br>
plain that she had told all that her head could retain of Roxana, and<br>
the days of joy which I had spent at that part of the town, another<br>
accident had like to have blown us all up again.<br>
<br>
I was in a kind of dishabille when they came, having on a loose robe,<br>
like a morning-gown, but much after the Italian way; and I had not<br>
altered it when I went up, only dressed my head a little; and as I had<br>
been represented as having been lately very ill, so the dress was<br>
becoming enough for a chamber.<br>
<br>
This morning vest, or robe, call it as you please, was more shaped to<br>
the body than we wear them since, showing the body in its true shape,<br>
and perhaps a little too plainly if it had been to be worn where any men<br>
were to come; but among ourselves it was well enough, especially for hot<br>
weather; the colour was green, figured, and the stuff a French damask,<br>
very rich.<br>
<br>
This gown or vest put the girl's tongue a running again, and her sister,<br>
as she called her, prompted it; for as they both admired my vest, and<br>
were taken up much about the beauty of the dress, the charming damask,<br>
the noble trimming, and the like, my girl puts in a word to the sister<br>
(captain's wife), &quot;This is just such a thing as I told you,&quot; says she,<br>
&quot;the lady danced in.&quot; &quot;What,&quot; says the captain's wife, &quot;the Lady Roxana<br>
that you told me of? Oh! that's a charming story,&quot; says she, &quot;tell it my<br>
lady.&quot; I could not avoid saying so too, though from my soul I wished her<br>
in heaven for but naming it; nay, I won't say but if she had been<br>
carried t'other way it had been much as one to me, if I could but have<br>
been rid of her, and her story too, for when she came to describe the<br>
Turkish dress, it was impossible but the Quaker, who was a sharp,<br>
penetrating creature, should receive the impression in a more dangerous<br>
manner than the girl, only that indeed she was not so dangerous a<br>
person; for if she had known it all, I could more freely have trusted<br>
her than I could the girl, by a great deal, nay, I should have been<br>
perfectly easy in her.<br>
<br>
However, as I have said, her talk made me dreadfully uneasy, and the<br>
more when the captain's wife mentioned but the name of Roxana. What my<br>
face might do towards betraying me I knew not, because I could not see<br>
myself, but my heart beat as if it would have jumped out at my mouth,<br>
and my passion was so great, that, for want of vent, I thought I should<br>
have burst. In a word, I was in a kind of a silent rage, for the force I<br>
was under of restraining my passion was such as I never felt the like<br>
of. I had no vent, nobody to open myself to, or to make a complaint to,<br>
for my relief; I durst not leave the room by any means, for then she<br>
would have told all the story in my absence, and I should have been<br>
perpetually uneasy to know what she had said, or had not said; so that,<br>
in a word, I was obliged to sit and hear her tell all the story of<br>
Roxana, that is to say, of myself, and not know at the same time whether<br>
she was in earnest or in jest, whether she knew me or no; or, in short,<br>
whether I was to be exposed, or not exposed.<br>
<br>
She began only in general with telling where she lived, what a place she<br>
had of it, how gallant a company her lady had always had in the house;<br>
how they used to sit up all night in the house gaming and dancing; what<br>
a fine lady her mistress was, and what a vast deal of money the upper<br>
servants got; as for her, she said, her whole business was in the next<br>
house, so that she got but little, except one night that there was<br>
twenty guineas given to be divided among the servants, when, she said,<br>
she got two guineas and a half for her share.<br>
<br>
She went on, and told them how many servants there was, and how they<br>
were ordered; but, she said, there was one Mrs. Amy who was over them<br>
all; and that she, being the lady's favourite, got a great deal. She did<br>
not know, she said, whether Amy was her Christian name or her surname,<br>
but she supposed it was her surname; that they were told she got<br>
threescore pieces of gold at one time, being the same night that the<br>
rest of the servants had the twenty guineas divided among them.<br>
<br>
I put in at that word, and said it was a vast deal to give away. &quot;Why,&quot;<br>
says I, &quot;it was a portion for a servant.&quot; &quot;O madam!&quot; says she, &quot;it was<br>
nothing to what she got afterwards; we that were servants hated her<br>
heartily for it; that is to say, we wished it had been our lot in her<br>
stead.&quot; Then I said again, &quot;Why, it was enough to get her a good<br>
husband, and settle her for the world, if she had sense to manage it.&quot;<br>
&quot;So it might, to be sure, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;for we were told she laid<br>
up above &pound;500; but, I suppose, Mrs. Amy was too sensible that her<br>
character would require a good portion to put her off.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; said I, &quot;if that was the case it was another thing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay,&quot; says she, &quot;I don't know, but they talked very much of a young<br>
lord that was very great with her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And pray what came of her at last?&quot; said I, for I was willing to hear a<br>
little (seeing she would talk of it) what she had to say, as well of Amy<br>
as of myself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't know, madam,&quot; said she, &quot;I never heard of her for several<br>
years, till t'other day I happened to see her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you indeed?&quot; says I (and made mighty strange of it); &quot;what! and in<br>
rags, it may be,&quot; said I; &quot;that's often the end of such creatures.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Just the contrary, madam,&quot; says she. &quot;She came to visit an acquaintance<br>
of mine, little thinking, I suppose, to see me, and, I assure you, she<br>
came in her coach.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In her coach!&quot; said I; &quot;upon my word, she had made her market then; I<br>
suppose she made hay while the sun shone. Was she married, pray?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I believe she had been married, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;but it seems she had<br>
been at the East Indies; and if she was married, it was there, to be<br>
sure. I think she said she had good luck in the Indies.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is, I suppose,&quot; said I, &quot;had buried her husband there.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understood it so, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;and that she had got his<br>
estate.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Was that her good luck?&quot; said I; &quot;it might be good to her, as to the<br>
money indeed, but it was but the part of a jade to call it good luck.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thus far our discourse of Mrs. Amy went, and no farther, for she knew no<br>
more of her; but then the Quaker unhappily, though undesignedly, put in<br>
a question, which the honest good-humoured creature would have been far<br>
from doing if she had known that I had carried on the discourse of Amy<br>
on purpose to drop Roxana out of the conversation.<br>
<br>
But I was not to be made easy too soon. The Quaker put in, &quot;But I think<br>
thou saidst something was behind of thy mistress; what didst thou call<br>
her? Roxana, was it not? Pray, what became of her?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ay, ay, Roxana,&quot; says the captain's wife; &quot;pray, sister, let's hear the<br>
story of Roxana; it will divert my lady, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's a damned lie,&quot; said I to myself; &quot;if you knew how little 't<br>
would divert me, you would have too much advantage over me.&quot; Well, I saw<br>
no remedy, but the story must come on, so I prepared to hear the worst<br>
of it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Roxana!&quot; says she, &quot;I know not what to say of her; she was so much<br>
above us, and so seldom seen, that we could know little of her but by<br>
report; but we did sometimes see her too; she was a charming woman<br>
indeed, and the footmen used to say that she was to be sent for to<br>
court.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;To court!&quot; said I; &quot;why, she was at court, wasn't she? the Pall Mall is<br>
not far from Whitehall.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;but I mean another way.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand thee,&quot; says the Quaker; &quot;thou meanest, I suppose, to be<br>
mistress to the king.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, madam,&quot; said she.<br>
<br>
I cannot help confessing what a reserve of pride still was left in me;<br>
and though I dreaded the sequel of the story, yet when she talked how<br>
handsome and how fine a lady this Roxana was, I could not help being<br>
pleased and tickled with it, and put in questions two or three times of<br>
how handsome she was; and was she really so fine a woman as they talked<br>
of; and the like, on purpose to hear her repeat what the people's<br>
opinion of me was, and how I had behaved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; says she, at last, &quot;she was a most beautiful creature as ever<br>
I saw in my life.&quot; &quot;But then,&quot; said I, &quot;you never had the opportunity to<br>
see her but when she was set out to the best advantage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;I have seen her several times in her<br>
_d&eacute;shabille_. And I can assure you, she was a very fine woman; and that<br>
which was more still, everybody said she did not paint.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was still agreeable to me one way; but there was a devilish sting<br>
in the tail of it all, and this last article was one; wherein she said<br>
she had seen me several times in my _d&eacute;shabille_. This put me in mind<br>
that then she must certainly know me, and it would come out at last;<br>
which was death to me but to think of.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, but, sister,&quot; says the captain's wife, &quot;tell my lady about the<br>
ball; that's the best of all the story; and of Roxana's dancing in a<br>
fine outlandish dress.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That's one of the brightest parts of her story indeed,&quot; says the girl.<br>
&quot;The case was this: we had balls and meetings in her ladyship's<br>
apartments every week almost; but one time my lady invited all the<br>
nobles to come such a time, and she would give them a ball; and there<br>
was a vast crowd indeed,&quot; says she.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think you said the king was there, sister, didn't you?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;that was the second time, when they said the<br>
king had heard how finely the Turkish lady danced, and that he was<br>
there to see her; but the king, if his Majesty was there, came<br>
disguised.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;That is, what they call incog.,&quot; says my friend the Quaker; &quot;thou canst<br>
not think the king would disguise himself.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; says the girl, &quot;it<br>
was so; he did not come in public with his guards, but we all knew which<br>
was the king well enough, that is to say, which they said was the king.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; says the captain's wife, &quot;about the Turkish dress; pray let us<br>
hear that.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; says she, &quot;my lady sat in a fine little drawing-room,<br>
which opened into the great room, and where she received the compliments<br>
of the company; and when the dancing began, a great lord,&quot; says she, &quot;I<br>
forget who they called him (but he was a very great lord or duke, I<br>
don't know which), took her out, and danced with her; but after a while,<br>
my lady on a sudden shut the drawing-room, and ran upstairs with her<br>
woman, Mrs. Amy; and though she did not stay long (for I suppose she had<br>
contrived it all beforehand), she came down dressed in the strangest<br>
figure that ever I saw in my life; but it was exceeding fine.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here she went on to describe the dress, as I have done already; but did<br>
it so exactly, that I was surprised at the manner of her telling it;<br>
there was not a circumstance of it left out.<br>
<br>
I was now under a new perplexity, for this young slut gave so complete<br>
an account of everything in the dress, that my friend the Quaker<br>
coloured at it, and looked two or three times at me, to see if I did not<br>
do so too; for (as she told me afterwards) she immediately perceived it<br>
was the same dress that she had seen me have on, as I have said before.<br>
However, as she saw I took no notice of it, she kept her thought private<br>
to herself; and I did so too, as well as I could.<br>
<br>
I put in two or three times, that she had a good memory, that could be<br>
so particular in every part of such a thing.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, madam!&quot; says she, &quot;we that were servants, stood by ourselves in a<br>
corner, but so as we could see more than some strangers; besides,&quot; says<br>
she, &quot;it was all our conversation for several days in the family, and<br>
what one did not observe another did.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; says I to her, &quot;this was<br>
no Persian dress; only, I suppose your lady was some French comedian,<br>
that is to say, a stage Amazon, that put on a counterfeit dress to<br>
please the company, such as they used in the play of Tamerlane at Paris,<br>
or some such.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, indeed, madam,&quot; says she, &quot;I assure you my lady was no actress; she<br>
was a fine modest lady, fit to be a princess; everybody said if she was<br>
a mistress, she was fit to be a mistress to none but the king; and they<br>
talked her up for the king as if it had really been so. Besides, madam,&quot;<br>
says she, &quot;my lady danced a Turkish dance; all the lords and gentry said<br>
it was so; and one of them swore he had seen it danced in Turkey<br>
himself, so that it could not come from the theatre at Paris; and then<br>
the name Roxana,&quot; says she, &quot;was a Turkish name.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;but that was not your lady's name, I suppose?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no, madam,&quot; said she, &quot;I know that. I know my lady's name and<br>
family very well; Roxana was not her name, that's true, indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here she run me aground again, for I durst not ask her what was Roxana's<br>
real name, lest she had really dealt with the devil, and had boldly<br>
given my own name in for answer; so that I was still more and more<br>
afraid that the girl had really gotten the secret somewhere or other;<br>
though I could not imagine neither how that could be.<br>
<br>
In a word, I was sick of the discourse, and endeavoured many ways to put<br>
an end to it, but it was impossible; for the captain's wife, who called<br>
her sister, prompted her, and pressed her to tell it, most ignorantly<br>
thinking that it would be a pleasant tale to all of us.<br>
<br>
Two or three times the Quaker put in, that this Lady Roxana had a good<br>
stock of assurance; and that it was likely, if she had been in Turkey,<br>
she had lived with, or been kept by, some great bashaw there. But still<br>
she would break in upon all such discourse, and fly out into the most<br>
extravagant praises of her mistress, the famed Roxana. I run her down as<br>
some scandalous woman; that it was not possible to be otherwise; but she<br>
would not hear of it; her lady was a person of such and such<br>
qualifications that nothing but an angel was like her, to be sure; and<br>
yet, after all she could say, her own account brought her down to this,<br>
that, in short, her lady kept little less than a gaming ordinary; or, as<br>
it would be called in the times since that, an assembly for gallantry<br>
and play.<br>
<br>
All this while I was very uneasy, as I said before, and yet the whole<br>
story went off again without any discovery, only that I seemed a little<br>
concerned that she should liken me to this gay lady, whose character I<br>
pretended to run down very much, even upon the foot of her own relation.<br>
<br>
But I was not at the end of my mortifications yet, neither, for now my<br>
innocent Quaker threw out an unhappy expression, which put me upon the<br>
tenters again. Says she to me, &quot;This lady's habit, I fancy, is just such<br>
a one as thine, by the description of it;&quot; and then turning to the<br>
captain's wife, says she, &quot;I fancy my friend has a finer Turkish or<br>
Persian dress, a great deal.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says the girl, &quot;'tis impossible to<br>
be finer; my lady's,&quot; says she, &quot;was all covered with gold and diamonds;<br>
her hair and head-dress, I forget the name they gave it,&quot; said she,<br>
&quot;shone like the stars, there were so many jewels in it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I never wished my good friend the Quaker out of my company before now;<br>
but, indeed, I would have given some guineas to have been rid of her<br>
just now; for beginning to be curious in the comparing the two dresses,<br>
she innocently began a description of mine; and nothing terrified me so<br>
much as the apprehension lest she should importune me to show it, which<br>
I was resolved I would never agree to. But before it came to this, she<br>
pressed my girl to describe the tyhaia, or head-dress, which she did so<br>
cleverly that the Quaker could not help saying mine was just such a one;<br>
and after several other similitudes, all very vexatious to me, out comes<br>
the kind motion to me to let the ladies see my dress; and they joined<br>
their eager desires of it, even to importunity.<br>
<br>
I desired to be excused, though I had little to say at first why I<br>
declined it; but at last it came into my head to say it was packed up<br>
with my other clothes that I had least occasion for, in order to be sent<br>
on board the captain's ship; but that if we lived to come to Holland<br>
together (which, by the way, I resolved should never happen), then, I<br>
told them, at unpacking my clothes, they should see me dressed in it;<br>
but they must not expect I should dance in it, like the Lady Roxana in<br>
all her fine things.<br>
<br>
This carried it off pretty well; and getting over this, got over most of<br>
the rest, and I began to be easy again; and, in a word, that I may<br>
dismiss the story too, as soon as may be, I got rid at last of my<br>
visitors, who I had wished gone two hours sooner than they intended it.<br>
<br>
As soon as they were gone, I ran up to Amy, and gave vent to my passions<br>
by telling her the whole story, and letting her see what mischiefs one<br>
false step of hers had like, unluckily, to have involved us all in;<br>
more, perhaps, than we could ever have lived to get through. Amy was<br>
sensible of it enough, and was just giving her wrath a vent another way,<br>
viz., by calling the poor girl all the damned jades and fools (and<br>
sometimes worse names) that she could think of, in the middle of which<br>
up comes my honest, good Quaker, and put an end to our discourse. The<br>
Quaker came in smiling (for she was always soberly cheerful). &quot;Well,&quot;<br>
says she, &quot;thou art delivered at last; I come to joy thee of it; I<br>
perceived thou wert tired grievously of thy visitors.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; says I, &quot;so I was; that foolish young girl held us all in a<br>
Canterbury story; I thought she would never have done with it.&quot; &quot;Why,<br>
truly, I thought she was very careful to let thee know she was but a<br>
cook-maid.&quot; &quot;Ay,&quot; says I, &quot;and at a gaming-house, or gaming-ordinary,<br>
and at t'other end of the town too; all which (by the way) she might<br>
know would add very little to her good name among us citizens.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't think,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;but she had some other drift in that<br>
long discourse; there's something else in her head,&quot; says she, &quot;I am<br>
satisfied of that.&quot; Thought I, &quot;Are you satisfied of it? I am sure I am<br>
the less satisfied for that; at least 'tis but small satisfaction to me<br>
to hear you say so. What can this be?&quot; says I; &quot;and when will my<br>
uneasiness have an end?&quot; But this was silent, and to myself, you may be<br>
sure. But in answer to my friend the Quaker, I returned by asking her a<br>
question or two about it; as what she thought was in it, and why she<br>
thought there was anything in it. &quot;For,&quot; says I, &quot;she can have nothing<br>
in it relating to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay,&quot; says the kind Quaker, &quot;if she had any view towards thee, that's<br>
no business of mine; and I should be far from desiring thee to inform<br>
me.&quot;<br>
<br>
This alarmed me again; not that I feared trusting the good-humoured<br>
creature with it, if there had been anything of just suspicion in her;<br>
but this affair was a secret I cared not to communicate to anybody.<br>
However, I say, this alarmed me a little; for as I had concealed<br>
everything from her, I was willing to do so still; but as she could not<br>
but gather up abundance of things from the girl's discourse, which<br>
looked towards me, so she was too penetrating to be put off with such<br>
answers as might stop another's mouth. Only there was this double<br>
felicity in it, first, that she was not inquisitive to know or find<br>
anything out, and not dangerous if she had known the whole story. But,<br>
as I say, she could not but gather up several circumstances from the<br>
girl's discourse, as particularly the name of Amy, and the several<br>
descriptions of the Turkish dress which my friend the Quaker had seen,<br>
and taken so much notice of, as I have said above.<br>
<br>
As for that, I might have turned it off by jesting with Amy, and asking<br>
her who she lived with before she came to live with me. But that would<br>
not do, for we had unhappily anticipated that way of talking, by having<br>
often talked how long Amy had lived with me; and, which was still worse,<br>
by having owned formerly that I had had lodgings in the Pall Mall; so<br>
that all those things corresponded too well. There was only one thing<br>
that helped me out with the Quaker, and that was the girl's having<br>
reported how rich Mrs. Amy was grown, and that she kept her coach. Now,<br>
as there might be many more Mrs. Amys besides mine, so it was not likely<br>
to be my Amy, because she was far from such a figure as keeping her<br>
coach; and this carried it off from the suspicions which the good<br>
friendly Quaker might have in her head.<br>
<br>
But as to what she imagined the girl had in her head, there lay more<br>
real difficulty in that part a great deal, and I was alarmed at it very<br>
much, for my friend the Quaker told me that she observed the girl was in<br>
a great passion when she talked of the habit, and more when I had been<br>
importuned to show her mine, but declined it. She said she several times<br>
perceived her to be in disorder, and to restrain herself with great<br>
difficulty; and once or twice she muttered to herself that she had found<br>
it out, or that she would find it out, she could not tell whether; and<br>
that she often saw tears in her eyes; that when I said my suit of<br>
Turkish clothes was put up, but that she should see it when we arrived<br>
in Holland, she heard her say softly she would go over on purpose then.<br>
<br>
After she had ended her observations, I added: &quot;I observed, too, that<br>
the girl talked and looked oddly, and that she was mighty inquisitive,<br>
but I could not imagine what it was she aimed at.&quot; &quot;Aimed at,&quot; says the<br>
Quaker, &quot;'tis plain to me what she aims at. She believes thou art the<br>
same Lady Roxana that danced in the Turkish vest, but she is not<br>
certain.&quot; &quot;Does she believe so?&quot; says I; &quot;if I had thought that, I would<br>
have put her out of her pain.&quot; &quot;Believe so!&quot; says the Quaker; &quot;yes, and<br>
I began to think so too, and should have believed so still, if thou<br>
had'st not satisfied me to the contrary by thy taking no notice of it,<br>
and by what thou hast said since.&quot; &quot;Should you have believed so?&quot; said I<br>
warmly; &quot;I am very sorry for that. Why, would you have taken me for an<br>
actress, or a French stage-player?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; says the good kind creature,<br>
&quot;thou carriest it too far; as soon as thou madest thy reflections upon<br>
her, I knew it could not be; but who could think any other when she<br>
described the Turkish dress which thou hast here, with the head-tire and<br>
jewels, and when she named thy maid Amy too, and several other<br>
circumstances concurring? I should certainly have believed it,&quot; said<br>
she, &quot;if thou hadst not contradicted it; but as soon as I heard thee<br>
speak, I concluded it was otherwise.&quot; &quot;That was very kind,&quot; said I, &quot;and<br>
I am obliged to you for doing me so much justice; it is more, it seems,<br>
than that young talking creature does.&quot; &quot;Nay,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;indeed<br>
she does not do thee justice; for she as certainly believes it still as<br>
ever she did.&quot; &quot;Does she?&quot; said I. &quot;Ay,&quot; says the Quaker; &quot;and I warrant<br>
thee she'll make thee another visit about it.&quot; &quot;Will she?&quot; said I;<br>
&quot;then I believe I shall downright affront her.&quot; &quot;No, thou shalt not<br>
affront her,&quot; says she (full of her good-humour and temper), &quot;I'll take<br>
that part off thy hands, for I'll affront her for thee, and not let her<br>
see thee.&quot; I thought that was a very kind offer, but was at a loss how<br>
she would be able to do it; and the thought of seeing her there again<br>
half distracted me, not knowing what temper she would come in, much less<br>
what manner to receive her in; but my fast friend and constant<br>
comforter, the Quaker, said she perceived the girl was impertinent, and<br>
that I had no inclination to converse with her, and she was resolved I<br>
should not be troubled with her. But I shall have occasion to say more<br>
of this presently, for this girl went farther yet than I thought she<br>
had.<br>
<br>
It was now time, as I said before, to take measures with my husband, in<br>
order to put off my voyage; so I fell into talk with him one morning as<br>
he was dressing, and while I was in bed. I pretended I was very ill; and<br>
as I had but too easy a way to impose upon him, because he so absolutely<br>
believed everything I said, so I managed my discourse as that he should<br>
understand by it I was a-breeding, though I did not tell him so.<br>
<br>
However, I brought it about so handsomely that, before he went out of<br>
the room, he came and sat down by my bedside, and began to talk very<br>
seriously to me upon the subject of my being so every day ill, and<br>
that, as he hoped I was with child, he would have me consider well of<br>
it, whether I had not best alter my thoughts of the voyage to Holland;<br>
for that being sea-sick, and which was worse, if a storm should happen,<br>
might be very dangerous to me. And after saying abundance of the kindest<br>
things that the kindest of husbands in the world could say, he concluded<br>
that it was his request to me, that I would not think any more of going<br>
till after all should be over; but that I would, on the contrary,<br>
prepare to lie-in where I was, and where I knew, as well as he, I could<br>
be very well provided, and very well assisted.<br>
<br>
This was just what I wanted, for I had, as you have heard, a thousand<br>
good reasons why I should put off the voyage, especially with that<br>
creature in company; but I had a mind the putting it off should be at<br>
his motion, not my own; and he came into it of himself, just as I would<br>
have had it. This gave me an opportunity to hang back a little, and to<br>
seem as if I was unwilling. I told him I could not abide to put him to<br>
difficulties and perplexities in his business; that now he had hired the<br>
great cabin in the ship, and, perhaps, paid some of the money, and, it<br>
may be, taken freight for goods; and to make him break it all off again<br>
would be a needless charge to him, or, perhaps, a damage to the captain.<br>
<br>
As to that, he said, it was not to be named, and he would not allow it<br>
to be any consideration at all; that he could easily pacify the captain<br>
of the ship by telling him the reason of it, and that if he did make<br>
him some satisfaction for the disappointment, it should not be much.<br>
<br>
&quot;But, my dear,&quot; says I, &quot;you ha'n't heard me say I am with child,<br>
neither can I say so; and if it should not be so at last, then I shall<br>
have made a fine piece of work of it indeed; besides,&quot; says I, &quot;the two<br>
ladies, the captain's wife and her sister, they depend upon our going<br>
over, and have made great preparations, and all in compliment to me;<br>
what must I say to them?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;if you should not be with child, though I<br>
hope you are, yet there is no harm done; the staying three or four<br>
months longer in England will be no damage to me, and we can go when we<br>
please, when we are sure you are not with child, or, when it appearing<br>
that you are with child, you shall be down and up again; and as for the<br>
captain's wife and sister, leave that part to me; I'll answer for it<br>
there shall be no quarrel raised upon that subject. I'll make your<br>
excuse to them by the captain himself, so all will be well enough there,<br>
I'll warrant you.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was as much as I could desire, and thus it rested for awhile. I had<br>
indeed some anxious thoughts about this impertinent girl, but believed<br>
that putting off the voyage would have put an end to it all, so I began<br>
to be pretty easy; but I found myself mistaken, for I was brought to the<br>
point of destruction by her again, and that in the most unaccountable<br>
manner imaginable.<br>
<br>
My husband, as he and I had agreed, meeting the captain of the ship,<br>
took the freedom to tell him that he was afraid he must disappoint him,<br>
for that something had fallen out which had obliged him to alter his<br>
measures, and that his family could not be ready to go time enough for<br>
him.<br>
<br>
&quot;I know the occasion, sir,&quot; says the captain; &quot;I hear your lady has got<br>
a daughter more than she expected; I give you joy of it.&quot; &quot;What do you<br>
mean by that?&quot; says my spouse. &quot;Nay, nothing,&quot; says the captain, &quot;but<br>
what I hear the women tattle over the tea-table. I know nothing, but<br>
that you don't go the voyage upon it, which I am sorry for; but you know<br>
your own affairs,&quot; added the captain, &quot;that's no business of mine.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, but,&quot; says my husband, &quot;I must make you some satisfaction for the<br>
disappointment,&quot; and so pulls out his money. &quot;No, no,&quot; says the captain;<br>
and so they fell to straining their compliments one upon another; but,<br>
in short, my spouse gave him three or four guineas, and made him take<br>
it. And so the first discourse went off again, and they had no more of<br>
it.<br>
<br>
But it did not go off so easily with me, for now, in a word, the clouds<br>
began to thicken about me, and I had alarms on every side. My husband<br>
told me what the captain had said, but very happily took it that the<br>
captain had brought a tale by halves, and having heard it one way, had<br>
told it another; and that neither could he understand the captain,<br>
neither did the captain understand himself, so he contented himself to<br>
tell me, he said, word for word, as the captain delivered it.<br>
<br>
How I kept my husband from discovering my disorder you shall hear<br>
presently; but let it suffice to say just now, that if my husband did<br>
not understand the captain, nor the captain understand himself, yet I<br>
understood them both very well; and, to tell the truth, it was a worse<br>
shock than ever I had yet. Invention supplied me, indeed, with a sudden<br>
motion to avoid showing my surprise; for as my spouse and I was sitting<br>
by a little table near the fire, I reached out my hand, as if I had<br>
intended to take a spoon which lay on the other side, and threw one of<br>
the candles off of the table; and then snatching it up, started up upon<br>
my feet, and stooped to the lap of my gown and took it in my hand. &quot;Oh!&quot;<br>
says I, &quot;my gown's spoiled; the candle has greased it prodigiously.&quot;<br>
This furnished me with an excuse to my spouse to break off the discourse<br>
for the present, and call Amy down; and Amy not coming presently, I said<br>
to him, &quot;My dear, I must run upstairs and put it off, and let Amy clean<br>
it a little.&quot; So my husband rose up too, and went into a closet where he<br>
kept his papers and books, and fetched a book out, and sat down by<br>
himself to read.<br>
<br>
Glad I was that I had got away, and up I run to Amy, who, as it<br>
happened, was alone. &quot;Oh, Amy!&quot; says I, &quot;we are all utterly undone.&quot; And<br>
with that I burst out a-crying, and could not speak a word for a great<br>
while.<br>
<br>
I cannot help saying that some very good reflections offered themselves<br>
upon this head. It presently occurred, what a glorious testimony it is<br>
to the justice of Providence, and to the concern Providence has in<br>
guiding all the affairs of men (even the least as well as the greatest),<br>
that the most secret crimes are, by the most unforeseen accidents,<br>
brought to light and discovered.<br>
<br>
Another reflection was, how just it is that sin and shame follow one<br>
another so constantly at the heels; that they are not like attendants<br>
only, but, like cause and consequence, necessarily connected one with<br>
another; that the crime going before, the scandal is certain to follow;<br>
and that 'tis not in the power of human nature to conceal the first, or<br>
avoid the last.<br>
<br>
&quot;What shall I do, Amy?&quot; said I, as soon as I could speak, &quot;and what will<br>
become of me?&quot; And then I cried again so vehemently that I could say no<br>
more a great while. Amy was frighted almost out of her wits, but knew<br>
nothing what the matter was; but she begged to know, and persuaded me to<br>
compose myself, and not cry so. &quot;Why, madam, if my master should come up<br>
now,&quot; says she, &quot;he will see what a disorder you are in; he will know<br>
you have been crying, and then he will want to know the cause of it.&quot;<br>
With that I broke out again. &quot;Oh, he knows it already, Amy,&quot; says I, &quot;he<br>
knows all! 'Tis all discovered, and we are undone!&quot; Amy was<br>
thunderstruck now indeed. &quot;Nay,&quot; says Amy, &quot;if that be true, we are<br>
undone indeed; but that can never be; that's impossible, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, no,&quot; says I, &quot;'tis far from impossible, for I tell you 'tis so.&quot;<br>
And by this time, being a little recovered, I told her what discourse my<br>
husband and the captain had had together, and what the captain had said.<br>
This put Amy into such a hurry that she cried, she raved, she swore and<br>
cursed like a mad thing; then she upbraided me that I would not let her<br>
kill the girl when she would have done it, and that it was all my own<br>
doing, and the like. Well, however, I was not for killing the girl yet.<br>
I could not bear the thoughts of that neither.<br>
<br>
We spent half-an-hour in these extravagances, and brought nothing out of<br>
them neither; for indeed we could do nothing or say nothing that was to<br>
the purpose; for if anything was to come out-of-the-way, there was no<br>
hindering it, or help for it; so after thus giving a vent to myself by<br>
crying, I began to reflect how I had left my spouse below, and what I<br>
had pretended to come up for; so I changed my gown that I pretended the<br>
candle fell upon, and put on another, and went down.<br>
<br>
When I had been down a good while, and found my spouse did not fall into<br>
the story again, as I expected, I took heart, and called for it. &quot;My<br>
dear,&quot; said I, &quot;the fall of the candle put you out of your history,<br>
won't you go on with it?&quot; &quot;What history?&quot; says he. &quot;Why,&quot; says I, &quot;about<br>
the captain.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says he, &quot;I had done with it. I know no more than<br>
that the captain told a broken piece of news that he had heard by<br>
halves, and told more by halves than he heard it,--namely, of your being<br>
with child, and that you could not go the voyage.&quot;<br>
<br>
I perceived my husband entered not into the thing at all, but took it<br>
for a story, which, being told two or three times over, was puzzled, and<br>
come to nothing, and that all that was meant by it was what he knew, or<br>
thought he knew already--viz., that I was with child, which he wished<br>
might be true.<br>
<br>
His ignorance was a cordial to my soul, and I cursed them in my thoughts<br>
that should ever undeceive him; and as I saw him willing to have the<br>
story end there, as not worth being farther mentioned, I closed it too,<br>
and said I supposed the captain had it from his wife; she might have<br>
found somebody else to make her remarks upon; and so it passed off with<br>
my husband well enough, and I was still safe there, where I thought<br>
myself in most danger. But I had two uneasinesses still; the first was<br>
lest the captain and my spouse should meet again, and enter into farther<br>
discourse about it; and the second was lest the busy impertinent girl<br>
should come again, and when she came, how to prevent her seeing Amy,<br>
which was an article as material as any of the rest; for seeing Amy<br>
would have been as fatal to me as her knowing all the rest.<br>
<br>
As to the first of these, I knew the captain could not stay in town<br>
above a week, but that his ship being already full of goods, and fallen<br>
down the river, he must soon follow, so I contrived to carry my husband<br>
somewhere out of town for a few days, that they might be sure not to<br>
meet.<br>
<br>
My greatest concern was where we should go. At last I fixed upon North<br>
Hall; not, I said, that I would drink the waters, but that I thought the<br>
air was good, and might be for my advantage. He, who did everything upon<br>
the foundation of obliging me, readily came into it, and the coach was<br>
appointed to be ready the next morning; but as we were settling matters,<br>
he put in an ugly word that thwarted all my design, and that was, that<br>
he had rather I would stay till afternoon, for that he should speak to<br>
the captain the next morning if he could, to give him some letters,<br>
which he could do, and be back again about twelve o'clock.<br>
<br>
I said, &quot;Ay, by all means.&quot; But it was but a cheat on him, and my voice<br>
and my heart differed; for I resolved, if possible, he should not come<br>
near the captain, nor see him, whatever came of it.<br>
<br>
In the evening, therefore, a little before we went to bed, I pretended<br>
to have altered my mind, and that I would not go to North Hall, but I<br>
had a mind to go another way, but I told him I was afraid his business<br>
would not permit him. He wanted to know where it was. I told him,<br>
smiling, I would not tell him, lest it should oblige him to hinder his<br>
business. He answered with the same temper, but with infinitely more<br>
sincerity, that he had no business of so much consequence as to hinder<br>
him going with me anywhere that I had a mind to go. &quot;Yes,&quot; says I, &quot;you<br>
want to speak with the captain before he goes away.&quot; &quot;Why, that's true,&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;so I do,&quot; and paused awhile; and then added, &quot;but I'll write a<br>
note to a man that does business for me to go to him; 'tis only to get<br>
some bills of loading signed, and he can do it.&quot; When I saw I had gained<br>
my point, I seemed to hang back a little. &quot;My dear,&quot; says I, &quot;don't<br>
hinder an hour's business for me; I can put it off for a week or two<br>
rather than you shall do yourself any prejudice.&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; says he,<br>
&quot;you shall not put it off an hour for me, for I can do my business by<br>
proxy with anybody but my wife.&quot; And then he took me in his arms and<br>
kissed me. How did my blood flush up into my face when I reflected how<br>
sincerely, how affectionately, this good-humoured gentleman embraced the<br>
most cursed piece of hypocrisy that ever came into the arms of an honest<br>
man! His was all tenderness, all kindness, and the utmost sincerity;<br>
mine all grimace and deceit;--a piece of mere manage and framed conduct<br>
to conceal a past life of wickedness, and prevent his discovering that<br>
he had in his arms a she-devil, whose whole conversation for twenty-five<br>
years had been black as hell, a complication of crime, and for which,<br>
had he been let into it, he must have abhorred me and the very mention<br>
of my name. But there was no help for me in it; all I had to satisfy<br>
myself was that it was my business to be what I was, and conceal what I<br>
had been; that all the satisfaction I could make him was to live<br>
virtuously for the time to come, not being able to retrieve what had<br>
been in time past; and this I resolved upon, though, had the great<br>
temptation offered, as it did afterwards, I had reason to question my<br>
stability. But of that hereafter.<br>
<br>
After my husband had kindly thus given up his measures to mine, we<br>
resolved to set out in the morning early. I told him that my project, if<br>
he liked it, was to go to Tunbridge, and he, being entirely passive in<br>
the thing, agreed to it with the greatest willingness; but said if I had<br>
not named Tunbridge, he would have named Newmarket, there being a great<br>
court there, and abundance of fine things to be seen. I offered him<br>
another piece of hypocrisy here, for I pretended to be willing to go<br>
thither, as the place of his choice, but indeed I would not have gone<br>
for a thousand pounds; for the court being there at that time, I durst<br>
not run the hazard of being known at a place where there were so many<br>
eyes that had seen me before. So that, after some time, I told my<br>
husband that I thought Newmarket was so full of people at that time,<br>
that we should get no accommodation; that seeing the court and the crowd<br>
was no entertainment at all to me, unless as it might be so to him, that<br>
if he thought fit, we would rather put it off to another time; and that<br>
if, when we went to Holland, we should go by Harwich, we might take a<br>
round by Newmarket and Bury, and so come down to Ipswich, and go from<br>
thence to the seaside. He was easily put off from this, as he was from<br>
anything else that I did not approve; and so, with all imaginable<br>
facility, he appointed to be ready early in the morning to go with me<br>
for Tunbridge.<br>
<br>
I had a double design in this, viz., first, to get away my spouse from<br>
seeing the captain any more; and secondly, to be out of the way myself,<br>
in case this impertinent girl, who was now my plague, should offer to<br>
come again, as my friend the Quaker believed she would, and as indeed<br>
happened within two or three days afterwards.<br>
<br>
Having thus secured my going away the next day, I had nothing to do but<br>
to furnish my faithful agent the Quaker with some instructions what to<br>
say to this tormentor (for such she proved afterwards), and how to<br>
manage her, if she made any more visits than ordinary.<br>
<br>
I had a great mind to leave Amy behind too, as an assistant, because she<br>
understood so perfectly well what to advise upon any emergence; and Amy<br>
importuned me to do so. But I know not what secret impulse prevailed<br>
over my thoughts against it; I could not do it for fear the wicked jade<br>
should make her away, which my very soul abhorred the thoughts of;<br>
which, however, Amy found means to bring to pass afterwards, as I may in<br>
time relate more particularly.<br>
<br>
It is true I wanted as much to be delivered from her as ever a sick man<br>
did from a third-day ague; and had she dropped into the grave by any<br>
fair way, as I may call it, I mean, had she died by any ordinary<br>
distemper, I should have shed but very few tears for her. But I was not<br>
arrived to such a pitch of obstinate wickedness as to commit murder,<br>
especially such as to murder my own child, or so much as to harbour a<br>
thought so barbarous in my mind. But, as I said, Amy effected all<br>
afterwards without my knowledge, for which I gave her my hearty curse,<br>
though I could do little more; for to have fallen upon Amy had been to<br>
have murdered myself. But this tragedy requires a longer story than I<br>
have room for here. I return to my journey.<br>
<br>
My dear friend the Quaker was kind, and yet honest, and would do<br>
anything that was just and upright to serve me, but nothing wicked or<br>
dishonourable. That she might be able to say boldly to the creature, if<br>
she came, she did not know where I was gone, she desired I would not let<br>
her know; and to make her ignorance the more absolutely safe to herself,<br>
and likewise to me, I allowed her to say that she heard us talk of going<br>
to Newmarket, &amp;c. She liked that part, and I left all the rest to her,<br>
to act as she thought fit; only charged her, that if the girl entered<br>
into the story of the Pall Mall, she should not entertain much talk<br>
about it, but let her understand that we all thought she spoke of it a<br>
little too particularly; and that the lady (meaning me) took it a<br>
little ill to be so likened to a public mistress, or a stage-player, and<br>
the like; and so to bring her, if possible, to say no more of it.<br>
However, though I did not tell my friend the Quaker how to write to me,<br>
or where I was, yet I left a sealed paper with her maid to give her, in<br>
which I gave her a direction how to write to Amy, and so, in effect, to<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
It was but a few days after I was gone, but the impatient girl came to<br>
my lodgings on pretence to see how I did, and to hear if I intended to<br>
go the voyage, and the like. My trusty agent was at home, and received<br>
her coldly at the door; but told her that the lady, which she supposed<br>
she meant, was gone from her house.<br>
<br>
This was a full stop to all she could say for a good while; but as she<br>
stood musing some time at the door, considering what to begin a talk<br>
upon, she perceived my friend the Quaker looked a little uneasy, as if<br>
she wanted to go in and shut the door, which stung her to the quick; and<br>
the wary Quaker had not so much as asked her to come in; for seeing her<br>
alone she expected she would be very impertinent, and concluded that I<br>
did not care how coldly she received her.<br>
<br>
But she was not to be put off so. She said if the Lady ---- was not to<br>
be spoken with, she desired to speak two or three words with her,<br>
meaning my friend the Quaker. Upon that the Quaker civilly but coldly<br>
asked her to walk in, which was what she wanted. Note.--She did not<br>
carry her into her best parlour, as formerly, but into a little outer<br>
room, where the servants usually waited.<br>
<br>
By the first of her discourse she did not stick to insinuate as if she<br>
believed I was in the house, but was unwilling to be seen; and pressed<br>
earnestly that she might speak but two words with me; to which she added<br>
earnest entreaties, and at last tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am sorry,&quot; says my good creature the Quaker, &quot;thou hast so ill an<br>
opinion of me as to think I would tell thee an untruth, and say that the<br>
Lady ---- was gone from my house if she was not! I assure thee I do not<br>
use any such method; nor does the Lady ---- desire any such kind of<br>
service from me, as I know of. If she had been in the house, I should<br>
have told thee so.&quot;<br>
<br>
She said little to that, but said it was business of the utmost<br>
importance that she desired to speak with me about, and then cried again<br>
very much.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thou seem'st to be sorely afflicted,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;I wish I could<br>
give thee any relief; but if nothing will comfort thee but seeing the<br>
Lady ----, it is not in my power.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I hope it is,&quot; says she again; &quot;to be sure it is of great consequence<br>
to me, so much that I am undone without it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thou troublest me very much to hear thee say so,&quot; says the Quaker; &quot;but<br>
why, then, didst thou not speak to her apart when thou wast here<br>
before?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I had no opportunity,&quot; says she, &quot;to speak to her alone, and I could<br>
not do it in company; if I could have spoken but two words to her alone,<br>
I would have thrown myself at her foot, and asked her blessing.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am surprised at thee; I do not understand thee,&quot; says the Quaker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; says she, &quot;stand my friend if you have any charity, or if you have<br>
any compassion for the miserable; for I am utterly undone!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thou terrifiest me,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;with such passionate<br>
expressions, for verily I cannot comprehend thee!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; says she, &quot;she is my mother! she is my mother! and she does not<br>
own me!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thy mother!&quot; says the Quaker, and began to be greatly moved indeed. &quot;I<br>
am astonished at thee: what dost thou mean?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I mean nothing but what I say,&quot; says she. &quot;I say again, she is my<br>
mother, and will not own me;&quot; and with that she stopped with a flood of<br>
tears.<br>
<br>
&quot;Not own thee!&quot; says the Quaker; and the tender good creature wept too.<br>
&quot;Why,&quot; says she, &quot;she does not know thee, and never saw thee before.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No,&quot; says the girl, &quot;I believe she does not know me, but I know her;<br>
and I know that she is my mother.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;It's impossible, thou talk'st mystery!&quot; says the Quaker; &quot;wilt thou<br>
explain thyself a little to me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; says she, &quot;I can explain it well enough. I am sure she is my<br>
mother, and I have broke my heart to search for her; and now to lose her<br>
again, when I was so sure I had found her, will break my heart more<br>
effectually.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, but if she be thy mother,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;how can it be that<br>
she should not know thee?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Alas!&quot; says she, &quot;I have been lost to her ever since I was a child; she<br>
has never seen me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;And hast thou never seen her?&quot; says the Quaker.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says she, &quot;I have seen her; often enough I saw her; for when she<br>
was the Lady Roxana I was her housemaid, being a servant, but I did not<br>
know her then, nor she me; but it has all come out since. Has she not a<br>
maid named Amy?&quot; Note.--The honest Quaker was--nonplussed, and greatly<br>
surprised at that question.<br>
<br>
&quot;Truly,&quot; says she, &quot;the Lady ---- has several women servants, but I do<br>
not know all their names.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;But her woman, her favourite,&quot; adds the girl; &quot;is not her name Amy?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, truly,&quot; says the Quaker, with a very happy turn of wit, &quot;I do not<br>
like to be examined; but lest thou shouldest take up any mistakes by<br>
reason of my backwardness to speak, I will answer thee for once, that<br>
what her woman's name is I know not, but they call her Cherry.&quot;<br>
<br>
_N.B._--My husband gave her that name in jest on our wedding-day, and we<br>
had called her by it ever after; so that she spoke literally true at<br>
that time.<br>
<br>
The girl replied very modestly that she was sorry if she gave her any<br>
offence in asking; that she did not design to be rude to her, or pretend<br>
to examine her; but that she was in such an agony at this disaster that<br>
she knew not what she did or said; and that she should be very sorry to<br>
disoblige her, but begged of her again, as she was a Christian and a<br>
woman, and had been a mother of children, that she would take pity on<br>
her, and, if possible, assist her, so that she might but come to me and<br>
speak a few words to me.<br>
<br>
The tender-hearted Quaker told me the girl spoke this with such moving<br>
eloquence that it forced tears from her; but she was obliged to say that<br>
she neither knew where I was gone or how to write to me; but that if she<br>
did ever see me again she would not fail to give me an account of all<br>
she had said to her, or that she should yet think fit to say, and to<br>
take my answer to it, if I thought fit to give any.<br>
<br>
Then the Quaker took the freedom to ask a few particulars about this<br>
wonderful story, as she called it; at which the girl, beginning at the<br>
first distresses of my life, and indeed of her own, went through all the<br>
history of her miserable education, her service under the Lady Roxana,<br>
as she called me, and her relief by Mrs. Amy, with the reasons she had<br>
to believe that as Amy owned herself to be the same that lived with her<br>
mother, and especially that Amy was the Lady Roxana's maid too, and came<br>
out of France with her, she was by those circumstances, and several<br>
others in her conversation, as fully convinced that the Lady Roxana was<br>
her mother, as she was that the Lady ---- at her house (the Quaker's)<br>
was the very same Roxana that she had been servant to.<br>
<br>
My good friend the Quaker, though terribly shocked at the story, and not<br>
well knowing what to say, yet was too much my friend to seem convinced<br>
in a thing which she did not know to be true, and which, if it was true,<br>
she could see plainly I had a mind should not be known; so she turned<br>
her discourse to argue the girl out of it. She insisted upon the slender<br>
evidence she had of the fact itself, and the rudeness of claiming so<br>
near a relation of one so much above her, and of whose concern in it she<br>
had no knowledge, at least no sufficient proof; that as the lady at her<br>
house was a person above any disguises, so she could not believe that<br>
she would deny her being her daughter, if she was really her mother;<br>
that she was able sufficiently to have provided for her if she had not a<br>
mind to have her known; and, therefore, seeing she had heard all she had<br>
said of the Lady Roxana, and was so far from owning herself to be the<br>
person, so she had censured that sham lady as a cheat and a common<br>
woman; and that 'twas certain she could never be brought to own a name<br>
and character she had so justly exposed.<br>
<br>
Besides, she told her that her lodger, meaning me, was not a sham lady,<br>
but the real wife of a knight-baronet; and that she knew her to be<br>
honestly such, and far above such a person as she had described. She<br>
then added that she had another reason why it was not very possible to<br>
be true. &quot;And that is,&quot; says she, &quot;thy age is in the way; for thou<br>
acknowledgest that thou art four-and twenty years old, and that thou<br>
wast the youngest of three of thy mother's children; so that, by thy<br>
account, thy mother must be extremely young, or this lady cannot be thy<br>
mother; for thou seest,&quot; says she, &quot;and any one may see, she is but a<br>
young woman now, and cannot be supposed to be above forty years old, if<br>
she is so much; and is now big with child at her going into the country;<br>
so that I cannot give any credit to thy notion of her being thy mother;<br>
and if I might counsel thee, it should be to give over that thought, as<br>
an improbable story that does but serve to disorder thee, and disturb<br>
thy head; for,&quot; added she, &quot;I perceive thou art much disturbed indeed.&quot;<br>
<br>
But this was all nothing; she could be satisfied with nothing but seeing<br>
me; but the Quaker defended herself very well, and insisted on it that<br>
she could not give her any account of me; and finding her still<br>
importunate, she affected at last being a little disgusted that she<br>
should not believe her, and added, that indeed, if she had known where I<br>
was gone, she would not have given any one an account of it, unless I<br>
had given her orders to do so. &quot;But seeing she has not acquainted me,&quot;<br>
says she, &quot;where she has gone, 'tis an intimation to me she was not<br>
desirous it should be publicly known;&quot; and with this she rose up, which<br>
was as plain a desiring her to rise up too and begone as could be<br>
expressed, except the downright showing her the door.<br>
<br>
Well, the girl rejected all this, and told her she could not indeed<br>
expect that she (the Quaker) should be affected with the story she had<br>
told her, however moving, or that she should take any pity on her. That<br>
it was her misfortune, that when she was at the house before, and in the<br>
room with me, she did not beg to speak a word with me in private, or<br>
throw herself upon the floor at my feet, and claim what the affection of<br>
a mother would have done for her; but since she had slipped her<br>
opportunity, she would wait for another; that she found by her (the<br>
Quaker's) talk, that she had not quite left her lodgings, but was gone<br>
into the country, she supposed for the air; and she was resolved she<br>
would take so much knight-errantry upon her, that she would visit all<br>
the airing-places in the nation, and even all the kingdom over, ay, and<br>
Holland too, but she would find me; for she was satisfied she could so<br>
convince me that she was my own child, that I would not deny it; and she<br>
was sure I was so tender and compassionate, I would not let her perish<br>
after I was convinced that she was my own flesh and blood; and in saying<br>
she would visit all the airing-places in England, she reckoned them all<br>
up by name, and began with Tunbridge, the very place I was gone to; then<br>
reckoning up Epsom, North Hall, Barnet, Newmarket, Bury, and at last,<br>
the Bath; and with this she took her leave.<br>
<br>
My faithful agent the Quaker failed not to write to me immediately; but<br>
as she was a cunning as well as an honest woman, it presently occurred<br>
to her that this was a story which, whether true or false, was not very<br>
fit to come to my husband's knowledge; that as she did not know what I<br>
might have been, or might have been called in former times, and how far<br>
there might have been something or nothing in it, so she thought if it<br>
was a secret I ought to have the telling it myself; and if it was not,<br>
it might as well be public afterwards as now; and that, at least, she<br>
ought to leave it where she found it, and not hand it forwards to<br>
anybody without my consent. These prudent measures were inexpressibly<br>
kind, as well as seasonable; for it had been likely enough that her<br>
letter might have come publicly to me, and though my husband would not<br>
have opened it, yet it would have looked a little odd that I should<br>
conceal its contents from him, when I had pretended so much to<br>
communicate all my affairs.<br>
<br>
In consequence of this wise caution, my good friend only wrote me in few<br>
words, that the impertinent young woman had been with her, as she<br>
expected she would; and that she thought it would be very convenient<br>
that, if I could spare Cherry, I would send her up (meaning Amy),<br>
because she found there might be some occasion for her.<br>
<br>
As it happened, this letter was enclosed to Amy herself, and not sent<br>
by the way I had at first ordered; but it came safe to my hands; and<br>
though I was alarmed a little at it, yet I was not acquainted with the<br>
danger I was in of an immediate visit from this teasing creature till<br>
afterwards; and I ran a greater risk, indeed, than ordinary, in that I<br>
did not send Amy up under thirteen or fourteen days, believing myself as<br>
much concealed at Tunbridge as if I had been at Vienna.<br>
<br>
But the concern of my faithful spy (for such my Quaker was now, upon the<br>
mere foot of her own sagacity), I say, her concern for me, was my safety<br>
in this exigence, when I was, as it were, keeping no guard for myself;<br>
for, finding Amy not come up, and that she did not know how soon this<br>
wild thing might put her designed ramble in practice, she sent a<br>
messenger to the captain's wife's house, where she lodged, to tell her<br>
that she wanted to speak with her. She was at the heels of the<br>
messenger, and came eager for some news; and hoped, she said, the lady<br>
(meaning me) had been come to town.<br>
<br>
The Quaker, with as much caution as she was mistress of, not to tell a<br>
downright lie, made her believe she expected to hear of me very quickly;<br>
and frequently, by the by, speaking of being abroad to take the air,<br>
talked of the country about Bury, how pleasant it was, how wholesome,<br>
and how fine an air; how the downs about Newmarket were exceeding fine,<br>
and what a vast deal of company there was, now the court was there; till<br>
at last, the girl began to conclude that my ladyship was gone thither;<br>
for, she said, she knew I loved to see a great deal of company.<br>
<br>
&quot;Nay,&quot; says my friend, &quot;thou takest me wrong; I did not suggest,&quot; says<br>
she, &quot;that the person thou inquirest after is gone thither, neither do I<br>
believe she is, I assure thee.&quot; Well, the girl smiled, and let her know<br>
that she believed it for all that; so, to clench it fast, &quot;Verily,&quot; says<br>
she, with great seriousness, &quot;thou dost not do well, for thou suspectest<br>
everything and believest nothing. I speak solemnly to thee that I do not<br>
believe they are gone that way; so if thou givest thyself the trouble to<br>
go that way, and art disappointed, do not say that I have deceived<br>
thee.&quot; She knew well enough that if this did abate her suspicion it<br>
would not remove it, and that it would do little more than amuse her;<br>
but by this she kept her in suspense till Amy came up, and that was<br>
enough.<br>
<br>
When Amy came up, she was quite confounded to hear the relation which<br>
the Quaker gave her, and found means to acquaint me of it; only letting<br>
me know, to my great satisfaction, that she would not come to Tunbridge<br>
first, but that she would certainly go to Newmarket or Bury first.<br>
<br>
However, it gave me very great uneasiness; for as she resolved to ramble<br>
in search after me over the whole country, I was safe nowhere, no, not<br>
in Holland itself. So indeed I did not know what to do with her; and<br>
thus I had a bitter in all my sweet, for I was continually perplexed<br>
with this hussy, and thought she haunted me like an evil spirit.<br>
<br>
In the meantime Amy was next door to stark-mad about her; she durst not<br>
see her at my lodgings for her life; and she went days without number to<br>
Spitalfields, where she used to come, and to her former lodging, and<br>
could never meet with her. At length she took up a mad resolution that<br>
she would go directly to the captain's house in Redriff and speak with<br>
her. It was a mad step, that's true; but as Amy said she was mad, so<br>
nothing she could do could be otherwise. For if Amy had found her at<br>
Redriff, she (the girl) would have concluded presently that the Quaker<br>
had given her notice, and so that we were all of a knot; and that, in<br>
short, all she had said was right. But as it happened, things came to<br>
hit better than we expected; for that Amy going out of a coach to take<br>
water at Tower Wharf, meets the girl just come on shore, having crossed<br>
the water from Redriff. Amy made as if she would have passed by her,<br>
though they met so full that she did not pretend she did not see her,<br>
for she looked fairly upon her first, but then turning her head away<br>
with a slight, offered to go from her; but the girl stopped, and spoke<br>
first, and made some manners to her.<br>
<br>
Amy spoke coldly to her, and a little angry; and after some words,<br>
standing in the street or passage, the girl saying she seemed to be<br>
angry, and would not have spoken to her, &quot;Why,&quot; says Amy, &quot;how can you<br>
expect I should have any more to say to you after I had done so much<br>
for you, and you have behaved so to me?&quot; The girl seemed to take no<br>
notice of that now, but answered, &quot;I was going to wait on you now.&quot;<br>
&quot;Wait on me!&quot; says Amy; &quot;what do you mean by that?&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; says she<br>
again, with a kind of familiarity, &quot;I was going to your lodgings.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy was provoked to the last degree at her, and yet she thought it was<br>
not her time to resent, because she had a more fatal and wicked design<br>
in her head against her; which, indeed, I never knew till after it was<br>
executed, nor durst Amy ever communicate it to me; for as I had always<br>
expressed myself vehemently against hurting a hair of her head, so she<br>
was resolved to take her own measures without consulting me any more.<br>
<br>
In order to this, Amy gave her good words, and concealed her resentment<br>
as much as she could; and when she talked of going to her lodging, Amy<br>
smiled and said nothing, but called for a pair of oars to go to<br>
Greenwich; and asked her, seeing she said she was going to her lodging,<br>
to go along with her, for she was going home, and was all alone.<br>
<br>
Amy did this with such a stock of assurance that the girl was<br>
confounded, and knew not what to say; but the more she hesitated, the<br>
more Amy pressed her to go; and talking very kindly to her, told her if<br>
she did not go to see her lodgings she might go to keep her company, and<br>
she would pay a boat to bring her back again; so, in a word, Amy<br>
prevailed on her to go into the boat with her, and carried her down to<br>
Greenwich.<br>
<br>
'Tis certain that Amy had no more business at Greenwich than I had, nor<br>
was she going thither; but we were all hampered to the last degree with<br>
the impertinence of this creature; and, in particular, I was horribly<br>
perplexed with it.<br>
<br>
As they were in the boat, Amy began to reproach her with ingratitude in<br>
treating her so rudely who had done so much for her, and been so kind to<br>
her; and to ask her what she had got by it, or what she expected to get.<br>
Then came in my share, the Lady Roxana. Amy jested with that, and<br>
bantered her a little, and asked her if she had found her yet.<br>
<br>
But Amy was both surprised and enraged when the girl told her roundly<br>
that she thanked her for what she had done for her, but that she would<br>
not have her think she was so ignorant as not to know that what she<br>
(Amy) had done was by her mother's order, and who she was beholden to<br>
for it. That she could never make instruments pass for principals, and<br>
pay the debt to the agent when the obligation was all to the original.<br>
That she knew well enough who she was, and who she was employed by. That<br>
she knew the Lady ---- very well (naming the name that I now went by),<br>
which was my husband's true name, and by which she might know whether<br>
she had found out her mother or no.<br>
<br>
Amy wished her at the bottom of the Thames; and had there been no<br>
watermen in the boat, and nobody in sight, she swore to me she would<br>
have thrown her into the river. I was horribly disturbed when she told<br>
me this story, and began to think this would, at last, all end in my<br>
ruin; but when Amy spoke of throwing her into the river and drowning<br>
her, I was so provoked at her that all my rage turned against Amy, and I<br>
fell thoroughly out with her. I had now kept Amy almost thirty years,<br>
and found her on all occasions the faithfullest creature to me that ever<br>
woman had--I say, faithful to me; for, however wicked she was, still she<br>
was true to me; and even this rage of hers was all upon my account, and<br>
for fear any mischief should befall me.<br>
<br>
But be that how it would, I could not bear the mention of her murdering<br>
the poor girl, and it put me so beside myself, that I rose up in a rage,<br>
and bade her get out of my sight, and out of my house; told her I had<br>
kept her too long, and that I would never see her face more. I had<br>
before told her that she was a murderer, and a bloody-minded creature;<br>
that she could not but know that I could not bear the thought of it,<br>
much less the mention of it; and that it was the impudentest thing that<br>
ever was known to make such a proposal to me, when she knew that I was<br>
really the mother of this girl, and that she was my own child; that it<br>
was wicked enough in her, but that she must conclude I was ten times<br>
wickeder than herself if I could come into it; that the girl was in the<br>
right, and I had nothing to blame her for; but that it was owing to the<br>
wickedness of my life that made it necessary for me to keep her from a<br>
discovery; but that I would not murder my child, though I was otherwise<br>
to be ruined by it. Amy replied, somewhat rough and short, Would I not?<br>
but she would, she said, if she had an opportunity; and upon these words<br>
it was that I bade her get out of my sight and out of my house; and it<br>
went so far that Amy packed up her alls, and marched off; and was gone<br>
for almost good and all. But of that in its order; I must go back to her<br>
relation of the voyage which they made to Greenwich together.<br>
<br>
They held on the wrangle all the way by water; the girl insisted upon<br>
her knowing that I was her mother, and told her all the history of my<br>
life in the Pall Mall, as well after her being turned away as before,<br>
and of my marriage since; and which was worse, not only who my present<br>
husband was, but where he had lived, viz., at Rouen in France. She knew<br>
nothing of Paris or of where we was going to live, namely, at Nimeguen;<br>
but told her in so many words that if she could not find me here, she<br>
would go to Holland after me.<br>
<br>
They landed at Greenwich, and Amy carried her into the park with her,<br>
and they walked above two hours there in the farthest and remotest<br>
walks; which Amy did because, as they talked with great heat, it was<br>
apparent they were quarrelling, and the people took notice of it.<br>
<br>
They walked till they came almost to the wilderness at the south side<br>
of the park; but the girl, perceiving Amy offered to go in there among<br>
the woods and trees, stopped short there, and would go no further; but<br>
said she would not go in there.<br>
<br>
Amy smiled, and asked her what was the matter? She replied short, she<br>
did not know where she was, nor where she was going to carry her, and<br>
she would go no farther; and without any more ceremony, turns back, and<br>
walks apace away from her. Amy owned she was surprised, and came back<br>
too, and called to her, upon which the girl stopped, and Amy coming up<br>
to her, asked her what she meant?<br>
<br>
The girl boldly replied she did not know but she might murder her; and<br>
that, in short, she would not trust herself with her, and never would<br>
come into her company again alone.<br>
<br>
It was very provoking, but, however, Amy kept her temper with much<br>
difficulty, and bore it, knowing that much might depend upon it; so she<br>
mocked her foolish jealousy, and told her she need not be uneasy for<br>
her, she would do her no harm, and would have done her good if she would<br>
have let her; but since she was of such a refractory humour, she should<br>
not trouble herself, for she should never come into her company again;<br>
and that neither she or her brother or sister should ever hear from her<br>
or see her any more; and so she should have the satisfaction of being<br>
the ruin of her brother and sisters as well as of herself.<br>
<br>
The girl seemed a little mollified at that, and said that for herself,<br>
she knew the worst of it, she could seek her fortune; but it was hard<br>
her brother and sister should suffer on her score; and said something<br>
that was tender and well enough on that account. But Amy told her it was<br>
for her to take that into consideration; for she would let her see that<br>
it was all her own; that she would have done them all good, but that<br>
having been used thus, she would do no more for any of them; and that<br>
she should not need to be afraid to come into her company again, for she<br>
would never give her occasion for it any more. This, by the way, was<br>
false in the girl too; for she did venture into Amy's company again<br>
after that, once too much, as I shall relate by itself.<br>
<br>
They grew cooler, however, afterwards, and Amy carried her into a house<br>
at Greenwich, where she was acquainted, and took an occasion to leave<br>
the girl in a room awhile, to speak to the people in the house, and so<br>
prepare them to own her as a lodger in the house; and then going in to<br>
her again told her there she lodged, if she had a mind to find her out,<br>
or if anybody else had anything to say to her. And so Amy dismissed her,<br>
and got rid of her again; and finding an empty hackney-coach in the<br>
town, came away by land to London, and the girl, going down to the<br>
water-side, came by boat.<br>
<br>
This conversation did not answer Amy's end at all, because it did not<br>
secure the girl from pursuing her design of hunting me out; and though<br>
my indefatigable friend the Quaker amused her three or four days, yet I<br>
had such notice of it at last that I thought fit to come away from<br>
Tunbridge upon it. And where to go I knew not; but, in short, I went to<br>
a little village upon Epping Forest, called Woodford, and took lodgings<br>
in a private house, where I lived retired about six weeks, till I<br>
thought she might be tired of her search, and have given me over.<br>
<br>
Here I received an account from my trusty Quaker that the wench had<br>
really been at Tunbridge, had found out my lodgings, and had told her<br>
tale there in a most dismal tone; that she had followed us, as she<br>
thought, to London; but the Quaker had answered her that she knew<br>
nothing of it, which was indeed true; and had admonished her to be easy,<br>
and not hunt after people of such fashion as we were, as if we were<br>
thieves; that she might be assured, that since I was not willing to see<br>
her, I would not be forced to it; and treating me thus would effectually<br>
disoblige me. And with such discourses as these she quieted her; and she<br>
(the Quaker) added that she hoped I should not be troubled much more<br>
with her.<br>
<br>
It was in this time that Amy gave me the history of her Greenwich<br>
voyage, when she spoke of drowning and killing the girl in so serious a<br>
manner, and with such an apparent resolution of doing it, that, as I<br>
said, put me in a rage with her, so that I effectually turned her away<br>
from me, as I have said above, and she was gone; nor did she so much as<br>
tell me whither or which way she was gone. On the other hand, when I<br>
came to reflect on it that now I had neither assistant or confidant to<br>
speak to, or receive the least information from, my friend the Quaker<br>
excepted, it made me very uneasy.<br>
<br>
I waited and expected and wondered from day to day, still thinking Amy<br>
would one time or other think a little and come again, or at least let<br>
me hear of her; but for ten days together I heard nothing of her. I was<br>
so impatient that I got neither rest by day or sleep by night, and what<br>
to do I knew not. I durst not go to town to the Quaker's for fear of<br>
meeting that vexatious creature, my girl, and I could get no<br>
intelligence where I was; so I got my spouse, upon pretence of wanting<br>
her company, to take the coach one day and fetch my good Quaker to me.<br>
<br>
When I had her, I durst ask her no questions, nor hardly knew which end<br>
of the business to begin to talk of; but of her own accord she told me<br>
that the girl had been three or four times haunting her for news from<br>
me; and that she had been so troublesome that she had been obliged to<br>
show herself a little angry with her; and at last told her plainly that<br>
she need give herself no trouble in searching after me by her means, for<br>
she (the Quaker) would not tell her if she knew; upon which she<br>
refrained awhile. But, on the other hand, she told me it was not safe<br>
for me to send my own coach for her to come in, for she had some reason<br>
to believe that she (my daughter) watched her door night and day; nay,<br>
and watched her too every time she went in and out; for she was so bent<br>
upon a discovery that she spared no pains, and she believed she had<br>
taken a lodging very near their house for that purpose.<br>
<br>
I could hardly give her a hearing of all this for my eagerness to ask<br>
for Amy; but I was confounded when she told me she had heard nothing of<br>
her. It is impossible to express the anxious thoughts that rolled about<br>
in my mind, and continually perplexed me about her; particularly I<br>
reproached myself with my rashness in turning away so faithful a<br>
creature that for so many years had not only been a servant but an<br>
agent; and not only an agent, but a friend, and a faithful friend too.<br>
<br>
Then I considered too that Amy knew all the secret history of my life;<br>
had been in all the intrigues of it, and been a party in both evil and<br>
good; and at best there was no policy in it; that as it was very<br>
ungenerous and unkind to run things to such an extremity with her, and<br>
for an occasion, too, in which all the fault she was guilty of was owing<br>
to her excessive care for my safety, so it must be only her steady<br>
kindness to me, and an excess of generous friendship for me, that should<br>
keep her from ill-using me in return for it; which ill-using me was<br>
enough in her power, and might be my utter undoing.<br>
<br>
These thoughts perplexed me exceedingly, and what course to take I<br>
really did not know. I began, indeed, to give Amy quite over, for she<br>
had now been gone above a fortnight, and as she had taken away all her<br>
clothes, and her money too, which was not a little, and so had no<br>
occasion of that kind to come any more, so she had not left any word<br>
where she was gone, or to which part of the world I might send to hear<br>
of her.<br>
<br>
And I was troubled on another account too, viz., that my spouse and I<br>
too had resolved to do very handsomely for Amy, without considering what<br>
she might have got another way at all; but we had said nothing of it to<br>
her, and so I thought, as she had not known what was likely to fall in<br>
her way, she had not the influence of that expectation to make her come<br>
back.<br>
<br>
Upon the whole, the perplexity of this girl, who hunted me as if, like a<br>
hound, she had had a hot scent, but was now at a fault, I say, that<br>
perplexity, and this other part of Amy being gone, issued in this--I<br>
resolved to be gone, and go over to Holland; there, I believed, I should<br>
be at rest. So I took occasion one day to tell my spouse that I was<br>
afraid he might take it ill that I had amused him thus long, and that at<br>
last I doubted I was not with child; and that since it was so, our<br>
things being packed up, and all in order for going to Holland, I would<br>
go away now when he pleased.<br>
<br>
My spouse, who was perfectly easy whether in going or staying, left it<br>
all entirely to me; so I considered of it, and began to prepare again<br>
for my voyage. But, alas! I was irresolute to the last degree. I was,<br>
for want of Amy, destitute; I had lost my right hand; she was my<br>
steward, gathered in my rents (I mean my interest money) and kept my<br>
accounts, and, in a word, did all my business; and without her, indeed,<br>
I knew not how to go away nor how to stay. But an accident thrust itself<br>
in here, and that even in Amy's conduct too, which frighted me away, and<br>
without her too, in the utmost horror and confusion.<br>
<br>
I have related how my faithful friend the Quaker was come to me, and<br>
what account she gave me of her being continually haunted by my<br>
daughter; and that, as she said, she watched her very door night and<br>
day. The truth was, she had set a spy to watch so effectually that she<br>
(the Quaker) neither went in or out but she had notice of it.<br>
<br>
This was too evident when, the next morning after she came to me (for I<br>
kept her all night), to my unspeakable surprise I saw a hackney-coach<br>
stop at the door where I lodged, and saw her (my daughter) in the coach<br>
all alone. It was a very good chance, in the middle of a bad one, that<br>
my husband had taken out the coach that very morning, and was gone to<br>
London. As for me, I had neither life or soul left in me; I was so<br>
confounded I knew not what to do or to say.<br>
<br>
My happy visitor had more presence of mind than I, and asked me if I had<br>
made no acquaintance among the neighbours. I told her, yes, there was a<br>
lady lodged two doors off that I was very intimate with. &quot;But hast thou<br>
no way out backward to go to her?&quot; says she. Now it happened there was<br>
a back-door in the garden, by which we usually went and came to and from<br>
the house, so I told her of it. &quot;Well, well,&quot; says she, &quot;go out and make<br>
a visit then, and leave the rest to me.&quot; Away I run, told the lady (for<br>
I was very free there) that I was a widow to-day, my spouse being gone<br>
to London, so I came not to visit her, but to dwell with her that day,<br>
because also our landlady had got strangers come from London. So having<br>
framed this orderly lie, I pulled some work out of my pocket, and added<br>
I did not come to be idle.<br>
<br>
As I went out one way, my friend the Quaker went the other to receive<br>
this unwelcome guest. The girl made but little ceremony, but having bid<br>
the coachman ring at the gate, gets down out of the coach and comes to<br>
the door, a country girl going to the door (belonging to the house), for<br>
the Quaker forbid any of my maids going. Madam asked for my Quaker by<br>
name, and the girl asked her to walk in.<br>
<br>
Upon this, my Quaker, seeing there was no hanging back, goes to her<br>
immediately, but put all the gravity upon her countenance that she was<br>
mistress of, and that was not a little indeed.<br>
<br>
When she (the Quaker) came into the room (for they had showed my<br>
daughter into a little parlour), she kept her grave countenance, but<br>
said not a word, nor did my daughter speak a good while; but after some<br>
time my girl began and said, &quot;I suppose you know me, madam?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;I know thee.&quot; And so the dialogue went on.<br>
<br>
_Girl._ Then you know my business too?<br>
<br>
_Quaker._ No, verily, I do not know any business thou canst have here<br>
with me.<br>
<br>
_Girl._ Indeed, my business is not chiefly with you.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ Why, then, dost thou come after me thus far?<br>
<br>
_Girl._ You know whom I seek. [_And with that she cried._]<br>
<br>
_Qu._ But why shouldst thou follow me for her, since thou know'st that I<br>
assured thee more than once that I knew not where she was?<br>
<br>
_Girl._ But I hoped you could.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ Then thou must hope that I did not speak the truth, which would be<br>
very wicked.<br>
<br>
_Girl._ I doubt not but she is in this house.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ If those be thy thoughts, thou may'st inquire in the house; so<br>
thou hast no more business with me. Farewell! [_Offers to go._]<br>
<br>
_Girl._ I would not be uncivil; I beg you to let me see her.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ I am here to visit some of my friends, and I think thou art not<br>
very civil in following me hither.<br>
<br>
_Girl._ I came in hopes of a discovery in my great affair which you know<br>
of.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ Thou cam'st wildly, indeed; I counsel thee to go back again, and<br>
be easy; I shall keep my word with thee, that I would not meddle in it,<br>
or give thee any account, if I knew it, unless I had her orders.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: ROXANA'S DAUGHTER AND THE QUAKER<br>
<br>
_Here the girl importuned her again with the utmost earnestness, and<br>
cried bitterly_]<br>
<br>
_Girl._ If you knew my distress you could not be so cruel.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ Thou hast told me all thy story, and I think it might be more<br>
cruelty to tell thee than not to tell thee; for I understand she is<br>
resolved not to see thee, and declares she is not thy mother. Will'st<br>
thou be owned where thou hast no relation?<br>
<br>
_Girl._ Oh, if I could but speak to her, I would prove my relation to<br>
her so that she could not deny it any longer.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ Well, but thou canst not come to speak with her, it seems.<br>
<br>
_Girl._ I hope you will tell me if she is here. I had a good account<br>
that you were come out to see her, and that she sent for you.<br>
<br>
_Qu._ I much wonder how thou couldst have such an account. If I had come<br>
out to see her, thou hast happened to miss the house, for I assure thee<br>
she is not to be found in this house.<br>
<br>
Here the girl importuned her again with the utmost earnestness, and<br>
cried bitterly, insomuch that my poor Quaker was softened with it, and<br>
began to persuade me to consider of it, and, if it might consist with my<br>
affairs, to see her, and hear what she had to say; but this was<br>
afterwards. I return to the discourse.<br>
<br>
The Quaker was perplexed with her a long time; she talked of sending<br>
back the coach, and lying in the town all night. This, my friend knew,<br>
would be very uneasy to me, but she durst not speak a word against it;<br>
but on a sudden thought, she offered a bold stroke, which, though<br>
dangerous if it had happened wrong, had its desired effect.<br>
<br>
She told her that, as for dismissing her coach, that was as she pleased,<br>
she believed she would not easily get a lodging in the town; but that as<br>
she was in a strange place, she would so much befriend her, that she<br>
would speak to the people of the house, that if they had room, she might<br>
have a lodging there for one night, rather than be forced back to London<br>
before she was free to go.<br>
<br>
This was a cunning, though a dangerous step, and it succeeded<br>
accordingly, for it amused the creature entirely, and she presently<br>
concluded that really I could not be there then, otherwise she would<br>
never have asked her to lie in the house; so she grew cold again<br>
presently as to her lodging there, and said, No, since it was so, she<br>
would go back that afternoon, but she would come again in two or three<br>
days, and search that and all the towns round in an effectual manner, if<br>
she stayed a week or two to do it; for, in short, if I was in England or<br>
Holland she would find me.<br>
<br>
&quot;In truth,&quot; says the Quaker, &quot;thou wilt make me very hurtful to thee,<br>
then.&quot; &quot;Why so?&quot; says she, &quot;Because wherever I go, thou wilt put thyself<br>
to great expense, and the country to a great deal of unnecessary<br>
trouble.&quot; &quot;Not unnecessary,&quot; says she. &quot;Yes, truly,&quot; says the Quaker;<br>
&quot;it must be unnecessary, because it will be to no purpose. I think I<br>
must abide in my own house to save thee that charge and trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
She said little to that, except that, she said, she would give her as<br>
little trouble as possible; but she was afraid she should sometimes be<br>
uneasy to her, which she hoped she would excuse. My Quaker told her she<br>
would much rather excuse her if she would forbear; for that if she would<br>
believe her, she would assure her she should never get any intelligence<br>
of me by her.<br>
<br>
That set her into tears again; but after a while, recovering herself,<br>
she told her perhaps she might be mistaken; and she (the Quaker) should<br>
watch herself very narrowly, or she might one time or other get some<br>
intelligence from her, whether she would or no; and she was satisfied<br>
she had gained some of her by this journey, for that if I was not in the<br>
house, I was not far off; and if I did not remove very quickly, she<br>
would find me out. &quot;Very well,&quot; says my Quaker; &quot;then if the lady is not<br>
willing to see thee, thou givest me notice to tell her, that she may get<br>
out of thy way.&quot;<br>
<br>
She flew out in a rage at that, and told my friend that if she did, a<br>
curse would follow her, and her children after her, and denounced such<br>
horrid things upon her as frighted the poor tender-hearted Quaker<br>
strangely, and put her more out of temper than ever I saw her before; so<br>
that she resolved to go home the next morning, and I, that was ten times<br>
more uneasy than she, resolved to follow her, and go to London too;<br>
which, however, upon second thoughts, I did not, but took effectual<br>
measures not to be seen or owned if she came any more; but I heard no<br>
more of her for some time.<br>
<br>
I stayed there about a fortnight, and in all that time I heard no more<br>
of her, or of my Quaker about her; but after about two days more, I had<br>
a letter from my Quaker, intimating that she had something of moment to<br>
say, that she could not communicate by letter, but wished I would give<br>
myself the trouble to come up, directing me to come with the coach into<br>
Goodman's Fields, and then walk to her back-door on foot, which being<br>
left open on purpose, the watchful lady, if she had any spies, could not<br>
well see me.<br>
<br>
My thoughts had for so long time been kept, as it were, waking, that<br>
almost everything gave me the alarm, and this especially, so that I was<br>
very uneasy; but I could not bring matters to bear to make my coming to<br>
London so clear to my husband as I would have done; for he liked the<br>
place, and had a mind, he said, to stay a little longer, if it was not<br>
against my inclination; so I wrote my friend the Quaker word that I<br>
could not come to town yet; and that, besides, I could not think of<br>
being there under spies, and afraid to look out of doors; and so, in<br>
short, I put off going for near a fortnight more.<br>
<br>
At the end of that time she wrote again, in which she told me that she<br>
had not lately seen the impertinent visitor which had been so<br>
troublesome; but that she had seen my trusty agent Amy, who told her<br>
she had cried for six weeks without intermission; that Amy had given her<br>
an account how troublesome the creature had been, and to what straits<br>
and perplexities I was driven by her hunting after and following me from<br>
place to place; upon which Amy had said, that, notwithstanding I was<br>
angry with her, and had used her so hardly for saying something about<br>
her of the same kind, yet there was an absolute necessity of securing<br>
her, and removing her out of the way; and that, in short, without asking<br>
my leave, or anybody's leave, she should take care she should trouble<br>
her mistress (meaning me) no more; and that after Amy had said so, she<br>
had indeed never heard any more of the girl; so that she supposed Amy<br>
had managed it so well as to put an end to it.<br>
<br>
The innocent, well-meaning creature, my Quaker, who was all kindness and<br>
goodness in herself, and particularly to me, saw nothing in this; but<br>
she thought Amy had found some way to persuade her to be quiet and easy,<br>
and to give over teasing and following me, and rejoiced in it for my<br>
sake; as she thought nothing of any evil herself, so she suspected none<br>
in anybody else, and was exceeding glad of having such good news to<br>
write to me; but my thoughts of it run otherwise.<br>
<br>
I was struck, as with a blast from heaven, at the reading her letter; I<br>
fell into a fit of trembling from head to foot, and I ran raving about<br>
the room like a mad woman. I had nobody to speak a word to, to give<br>
vent to my passion; nor did I speak a word for a good while, till after<br>
it had almost overcome me. I threw myself on the bed, and cried out,<br>
&quot;Lord, be merciful to me, she has murdered my child!&quot; and with that a<br>
flood of tears burst out, and I cried vehemently for above an hour.<br>
<br>
My husband was very happily gone out a-hunting, so that I had the<br>
opportunity of being alone, and to give my passions some vent, by which<br>
I a little recovered myself. But after my crying was over, then I fell<br>
in a new rage at Amy; I called her a thousand devils and monsters and<br>
hard-hearted tigers; I reproached her with her knowing that I abhorred<br>
it, and had let her know it sufficiently, in that I had, at it were,<br>
kicked her out of doors, after so many years' friendship and service,<br>
only for naming it to me.<br>
<br>
Well, after some time, my spouse came in from his sport, and I put on<br>
the best looks I could to deceive him; but he did not take so little<br>
notice of me as not to see I had been crying, and that something<br>
troubled me, and he pressed me to tell him. I seemed to bring it out<br>
with reluctance, but told him my backwardness was more because I was<br>
ashamed that such a trifle should have any effect upon me, than for any<br>
weight that was in it; so I told him I had been vexing myself about my<br>
woman Amy's not coming again; that she might have known me better than<br>
not to believe I should have been friends with her again, and the like;<br>
and that, in short, I had lost the best servant by my rashness that ever<br>
woman had.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, well,&quot; says he, &quot;if that be all your grief, I hope you will soon<br>
shake it off; I'll warrant you in a little while we shall hear of Mrs.<br>
Amy again.&quot; And so it went off for that time. But it did not go off with<br>
me; for I was uneasy and terrified to the last degree, and wanted to get<br>
some farther account of the thing. So I went away to my sure and certain<br>
comforter, the Quaker, and there I had the whole story of it; and the<br>
good innocent Quaker gave me joy of my being rid of such an unsufferable<br>
tormentor.<br>
<br>
&quot;Rid of her! Ay,&quot; says I, &quot;if I was rid of her fairly and honourably;<br>
but I don't know what Amy may have done. Sure, she ha'n't made her<br>
away?&quot; &quot;Oh fie!&quot; says my Quaker; &quot;how canst thou entertain such a<br>
notion! No, no. Made her away? Amy didn't talk like that; I dare say<br>
thou may'st be easy in that; Amy has nothing of that in her head, I dare<br>
say,&quot; says she; and so threw it, as it were, out of my thoughts.<br>
<br>
But it would not do; it run in my head continually; night and day I<br>
could think of nothing else; and it fixed such a horror of the fact upon<br>
my spirits, and such a detestation of Amy, who I looked upon as the<br>
murderer, that, as for her, I believe if I could have seen her I should<br>
certainly have sent her to Newgate, or to a worse place, upon<br>
suspicion; indeed, I think I could have killed her with my own hands.<br>
<br>
As for the poor girl herself, she was ever before my eyes; I saw her by<br>
night and by day; she haunted my imagination, if she did not haunt the<br>
house; my fancy showed me her in a hundred shapes and postures; sleeping<br>
or waking, she was with me. Sometimes I thought I saw her with her<br>
throat cut; sometimes with her head cut, and her brains knocked out;<br>
other times hanged up upon a beam; another time drowned in the great<br>
pond at Camberwell. And all these appearances were terrifying to the<br>
last degree; and that which was still worse, I could really hear nothing<br>
of her; I sent to the captain's wife in Redriff, and she answered me,<br>
she was gone to her relations in Spitalfields. I sent thither, and they<br>
said she was there about three weeks ago, but that she went out in a<br>
coach with the gentlewoman that used to be so kind to her, but whither<br>
she was gone they knew not, for she had not been there since. I sent<br>
back the messenger for a description of the woman she went out with; and<br>
they described her so perfectly, that I knew it to be Amy, and none but<br>
Amy.<br>
<br>
I sent word again that Mrs. Amy, who she went out with, left her in two<br>
or three hours, and that they should search for her, for I had a reason<br>
to fear she was murdered. This frighted them all intolerably. They<br>
believed Amy had carried her to pay her a sum of money, and that<br>
somebody had watched her after her having received it, and had robbed<br>
and murdered her.<br>
<br>
I believed nothing of that part; but I believed, as it was, that<br>
whatever was done, Amy had done it; and that, in short, Amy had made her<br>
away; and I believed it the more, because Amy came no more near me, but<br>
confirmed her guilt by her absence.<br>
<br>
Upon the whole, I mourned thus for her for above a month; but finding<br>
Amy still come not near me, and that I must put my affairs in a posture<br>
that I might go to Holland, I opened all my affairs to my dear trusty<br>
friend the Quaker, and placed her, in matters of trust, in the room of<br>
Amy; and with a heavy, bleeding heart for my poor girl, I embarked with<br>
my spouse, and all our equipage and goods, on board another Holland's<br>
trader, not a packet-boat, and went over to Holland, where I arrived, as<br>
I have said.<br>
<br>
I must put in a caution, however, here, that you must not understand me<br>
as if I let my friend the Quaker into any part of the secret history of<br>
my former life; nor did I commit the grand reserved article of all to<br>
her, viz., that I was really the girl's mother, and the Lady Roxana;<br>
there was no need of that part being exposed; and it was always a maxim<br>
with me, that secrets should never be opened without evident utility. It<br>
could be of no manner of use to me or her to communicate that part to<br>
her; besides, she was too honest herself to make it safe to me; for<br>
though she loved me very sincerely, and it was plain by many<br>
circumstances that she did so, yet she would not lie for me upon<br>
occasion, as Amy would, and therefore it was not advisable on any terms<br>
to communicate that part; for if the girl, or any one else, should have<br>
come to her afterwards, and put it home to her, whether she knew that I<br>
was the girl's mother or not, or was the same as the Lady Roxana or not,<br>
she either would not have denied it, or would have done it with so ill a<br>
grace, such blushing, such hesitations and falterings in her answers, as<br>
would have put the matter out of doubt, and betrayed herself and the<br>
secret too.<br>
<br>
For this reason, I say, I did not discover anything of that kind to her;<br>
but I placed her, as I have said, in Amy's stead in the other affairs of<br>
receiving money, interests, rents, and the like, and she was as faithful<br>
as Amy could be, and as diligent.<br>
<br>
But there fell out a great difficulty here, which I knew not how to get<br>
over; and this was how to convey the usual supply of provision and money<br>
to the uncle and the other sister, who depended, especially the sister,<br>
upon the said supply for her support; and indeed, though Amy had said<br>
rashly that she would not take any more notice of the sister, and would<br>
leave her to perish, as above, yet it was neither in my nature, or Amy's<br>
either, much less was it in my design; and therefore I resolved to leave<br>
the management of what I had reserved for that work with my faithful<br>
Quaker, but how to direct her to manage them was the great difficulty.<br>
<br>
Amy had told them in so many words that she was not their mother, but<br>
that she was the maid Amy, that carried them to their aunt's; that she<br>
and their mother went over to the East Indies to seek their fortune, and<br>
that there good things had befallen them, and that their mother was very<br>
rich and happy; that she (Amy) had married in the Indies, but being now<br>
a widow, and resolving to come over to England, their mother had obliged<br>
her to inquire them out, and do for them as she had done; and that now<br>
she was resolved to go back to the Indies again; but that she had orders<br>
from their mother to do very handsomely by them; and, in a word, told<br>
them she had &pound;2000 apiece for them, upon condition that they proved<br>
sober, and married suitably to themselves, and did not throw themselves<br>
away upon scoundrels.<br>
<br>
The good family in whose care they had been, I had resolved to take more<br>
than ordinary notice of; and Amy, by my order, had acquainted them with<br>
it, and obliged my daughters to promise to submit to their government,<br>
as formerly, and to be ruled by the honest man as by a father and<br>
counsellor; and engaged him to treat them as his children. And to oblige<br>
him effectually to take care of them, and to make his old age<br>
comfortable both to him and his wife, who had been so good to the<br>
orphans, I had ordered her to settle the other &pound;2000, that is to say,<br>
the interest of it, which was &pound;120 a year, upon them, to be theirs for<br>
both their lives, but to come to my two daughters after them. This was<br>
so just, and was so prudently managed by Amy, that nothing she ever did<br>
for me pleased me better. And in this posture, leaving my two daughters<br>
with their ancient friend, and so coming away to me (as they thought to<br>
the East Indies), she had prepared everything in order to her going over<br>
with me to Holland; and in this posture that matter stood when that<br>
unhappy girl, who I have said so much of, broke in upon all our<br>
measures, as you have heard, and, by an obstinacy never to be conquered<br>
or pacified, either with threats or persuasions, pursued her search<br>
after me (her mother) as I have said, till she brought me even to the<br>
brink of destruction; and would, in all probability, have traced me out<br>
at last, if Amy had not, by the violence of her passion, and by a way<br>
which I had no knowledge of, and indeed abhorred, put a stop to her, of<br>
which I cannot enter into the particulars here.<br>
<br>
However, notwithstanding this, I could not think of going away and<br>
leaving this work so unfinished as Amy had threatened to do, and for the<br>
folly of one child to leave the other to starve, or to stop my<br>
determined bounty to the good family I have mentioned. So, in a word, I<br>
committed the finishing it all to my faithful friend the Quaker, to whom<br>
I communicated as much of the whole story as was needful to empower her<br>
to perform what Amy had promised, and to make her talk so much to the<br>
purpose, as one employed more remotely than Amy had been, needed to be.<br>
<br>
To this purpose she had, first of all, a full possession of the money;<br>
and went first to the honest man and his wife, and settled all the<br>
matter with them; when she talked of Mrs. Amy, she talked of her as one<br>
that had been empowered by the mother of the girls in the Indies, but<br>
was obliged to go back to the Indies, and had settled all sooner if she<br>
had not been hindered by the obstinate humour of the other daughter;<br>
that she had left instructions with her for the rest; but that the other<br>
had affronted her so much that she was gone away without doing anything<br>
for her; and that now, if anything was done, it must be by fresh orders<br>
from the East Indies.<br>
<br>
I need not say how punctually my new agent acted; but, which was more,<br>
she brought the old man and his wife, and my other daughter, several<br>
times to her house, by which I had an opportunity, being there only as a<br>
lodger, and a stranger, to see my other girl, which I had never done<br>
before, since she was a little child.<br>
<br>
The day I contrived to see them I was dressed up in a Quaker's habit,<br>
and looked so like a Quaker, that it was impossible for them, who had<br>
never seen me before, to suppose I had ever been anything else; also my<br>
way of talking was suitable enough to it, for I had learned that long<br>
before.<br>
<br>
I have not time here to take notice what a surprise it was to me to see<br>
my child; how it worked upon my affections; with what infinite struggle<br>
I mastered a strong inclination that I had to discover myself to her;<br>
how the girl was the very counterpart of myself, only much handsomer;<br>
and how sweetly and modestly she behaved; how, on that occasion, I<br>
resolved to do more for her than I had appointed by Amy, and the like.<br>
<br>
It is enough to mention here, that as the settling this affair made way<br>
for my going on board, notwithstanding the absence of my old agent Amy,<br>
so, however, I left some hints for Amy too, for I did not yet despair of<br>
my hearing from her; and that if my good Quaker should ever see her<br>
again, she should let her see them; wherein, particularly, ordering her<br>
to leave the affair of Spitalfields just as I had done, in the hands of<br>
my friend, she should come away to me; upon this condition,<br>
nevertheless, that she gave full satisfaction to my friend the Quaker<br>
that she had not murdered my child; for if she had, I told her I would<br>
never see her face more. However, notwithstanding this, she came over<br>
afterwards, without giving my friend any of that satisfaction, or any<br>
account that she intended to come over.<br>
<br>
I can say no more now, but that, as above, being arrived in Holland,<br>
with my spouse and his son, formerly mentioned, I appeared there with<br>
all the splendour and equipage suitable to our new prospect, as I have<br>
already observed.<br>
<br>
Here, after some few years of flourishing and outwardly happy<br>
circumstances, I fell into a dreadful course of calamities, and Amy<br>
also; the very reverse of our former good days. The blast of Heaven<br>
seemed to follow the injury done the poor girl by us both, and I was<br>
brought so low again, that my repentance seemed to be only the<br>
consequence of my misery, as my misery was of my crime.<br>
<br>

<br>
CONTINUATION<br>
<br>
(_From the 1745 Edition_)<br>
<br>
<br>
In resolving to go to Holland with my husband, and take possession of<br>
the title of countess as soon as possible, I had a view of deceiving my<br>
daughter, were she yet alive, and seeking me out; for it seldom happens<br>
that a nobleman, or his lady, are called by their surnames, and as she<br>
was a stranger to our noble title, might have inquired at our next door<br>
neighbours for Mr. ----, the Dutch merchant, and not have been one jot<br>
the wiser for her inquiry. So one evening, soon after this resolution,<br>
as I and my husband were sitting together when supper was over, and<br>
talking of several various scenes in life, I told him that, as there was<br>
no likelihood of my being with child, as I had some reason to suspect I<br>
was some time before, I was ready to go with him to any part of the<br>
world, whenever he pleased. I said, that great part of my things were<br>
packed up, and what was not would not be long about, and that I had<br>
little occasion to buy any more clothes, linen, or jewels, whilst I was<br>
in England, having a large quantity of the richest and best of<br>
everything by me already. On saying these words, he took me in his<br>
arms, and told me that he looked on what I had now spoken with so great<br>
an emphasis, to be my settled resolution, and the fault should not lie<br>
on his side if it miscarried being put in practice.<br>
<br>
The next morning he went out to see some merchants, who had received<br>
advice of the arrival of some shipping which had been in great danger at<br>
sea, and whose insurance had run very high; and it was this interval<br>
that gave me an opportunity of my coming to a final resolution. I now<br>
told the Quaker, as she was sitting at work in her parlour, that we<br>
should very speedily leave her, and although she daily expected it, yet<br>
she was really sorry to hear that we had come to a full determination;<br>
she said abundance of fine things to me on the happiness of the life I<br>
did then, and was going to live; believing, I suppose, that a countess<br>
could not have a foul conscience; but at that very instant, I would<br>
have, had it been in my power, resigned husband, estate, title, and all<br>
the blessings she fancied I had in the world, only for her real virtue,<br>
and the sweet peace of mind, joined to a loving company of children,<br>
which she really possessed.<br>
<br>
When my husband returned, he asked me at dinner if I persevered in my<br>
resolution of leaving England; to which I answered in the affirmative.<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;as all my affairs will not take up a week's time to<br>
settle, I will be ready to go from London with you in ten days' time.&quot;<br>
We fixed upon no particular place or abode, but in general concluded to<br>
go to Dover, cross the Channel to Calais, and proceed from thence by<br>
easy journeys to Paris, where after staying about a week, we intended to<br>
go through part of France, the Austrian Netherlands, and so on to<br>
Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or the Hague, as we were to settle before we went<br>
from Paris. As my husband did not care to venture all our fortune in one<br>
bottom, so our goods, money, and plate were consigned to several<br>
merchants, who had been his intimates many years, and he took notes of a<br>
prodigious value in his pocket, besides what he gave me to take care of<br>
during our journey. The last thing to be considered was, how we should<br>
go ourselves, and what equipage we should take with us; my thoughts were<br>
wholly taken up about it some time; I knew I was going to be a countess,<br>
and did not care to appear anything mean before I came to that honour;<br>
but, on the other hand, if I left London in any public way, I might<br>
possibly hear of inquiries after me in the road, that I had been<br>
acquainted with before. At last I said we would discharge all our<br>
servants, except two footmen, who should travel with us to Dover, and<br>
one maid to wait on me, that had lived with me only since the retreat of<br>
Amy, and she was to go through, if she was willing; and as to the<br>
carriage of us, a coach should be hired for my husband, myself, and<br>
maid, and two horses were to be hired for the footmen, who were to<br>
return with them to London.<br>
<br>
When the Quaker had heard when and how we intended to go, she begged, as<br>
there would be a spare seat in the coach, to accompany us as far as<br>
Dover, which we both readily consented to; no woman could be a better<br>
companion, neither was there any acquaintance that we loved better, or<br>
could show more respect to us.<br>
<br>
The morning before we set out, my husband sent for a master coachman to<br>
know the price of a handsome coach, with six able horses, to go to<br>
Dover. He inquired how many days we intended to be on the journey? My<br>
husband said he would go but very easy, and chose to be three days on<br>
the road; that they should stay there two days, and be three more<br>
returning to London, with a gentlewoman (meaning the Quaker) in it. The<br>
coachman said it would be an eight days' journey, and he would have ten<br>
guineas for it. My husband consented to pay him his demand, and he<br>
received orders to be ready at the door by seven of the clock the next<br>
morning: I was quite prepared to go, having no person to take leave of<br>
but the Quaker, and she had desired to see us take the packet-boat at<br>
Dover, before we parted with her; and the last night of my stay in<br>
London was spent very agreeably with the Quaker and her family. My<br>
husband, who stayed out later than usual, in taking his farewell of<br>
several merchants of his acquaintance, came home about eleven o'clock,<br>
and drank a glass or two of wine with us before we went to bed.<br>
<br>
The next morning, the whole family got up about five o'clock, and I,<br>
with my husband's consent, made each of the Quaker's daughters a present<br>
of a diamond ring, valued at &pound;20, and a guinea apiece to all the<br>
servants, without exception. We all breakfasted together, and at the<br>
hour appointed, the coach and attendants came to the door; this drew<br>
several people about it, who were all very inquisitive to know who was<br>
going into the country, and what is never forgot on such occasions, all<br>
the beggars in the neighbourhood were prepared to give us their<br>
benedictions in hopes of an alms. When the coachmen had packed up what<br>
boxes were designed for our use, we, namely, my husband, the Quaker,<br>
myself, and the waiting-maid, all got into the coach, the footmen were<br>
mounted on horses behind, and in this manner the coach, after I had<br>
given a guinea to one of the Quaker's daughters equally to divide among<br>
the beggars at the door, drove away from the house, and I took leave of<br>
my lodging in the Minories, as well as of London.<br>
<br>
At St. George's Church, Southwark, we were met by three gentlemen on<br>
horseback, who were merchants of my husband's acquaintance, and had come<br>
out on purpose, to go half a day's journey with us; and as they kept<br>
talking to us at the coach side, we went a good pace, and were very<br>
merry together; we stopped at the best house of entertainment on<br>
Shooter's Hill.<br>
<br>
Here we stopped for about an hour, and drank some wine, and my husband,<br>
whose chief study was how to please and divert me, caused me to alight<br>
out of the coach; which the gentlemen who accompanied us observing,<br>
alighted also. The waiter showed us upstairs into a large room, whose<br>
window opened to our view a fine prospect of the river Thames, which<br>
here, they say, forms one of the most beautiful meanders. It was within<br>
an hour of high water, and such a number of ships coming in under sail<br>
quite astonished as well as delighted me, insomuch that I could not help<br>
breaking out into such-like expressions, &quot;My dear, what a fine sight<br>
this is; I never saw the like before! Pray will they get to London this<br>
tide?&quot; At which the good-natured gentleman smiled, and said, &quot;Yes, my<br>
dear; why, there is London, and as the wind is quite fair for them, some<br>
of them will come to an anchor in about half-an-hour, and all within an<br>
hour.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was so taken up with looking down the river that, till my husband<br>
spoke, I had not once looked up the river; but when I did, and saw<br>
London, the Monument, the cathedral church of St. Paul, and the steeples<br>
belonging to the several parish churches, I was transported into an<br>
ecstasy, and could not refrain from saying, &quot;Sure that cannot be the<br>
place we are now just come from, it must be further off, for that looks<br>
to be scarce three miles off, and we have been three hours, by my watch,<br>
coming from our lodgings in the Minories! No, no, it is not London, it<br>
is some other place!&quot;<br>
<br>
Upon which one of the gentlemen present offered to convince me that the<br>
place I saw was London if I would go up to the top of the house, and<br>
view it from the turret. I accepted the offer, and I, my husband, and<br>
the three gentlemen were conducted by the master of the house upstairs<br>
into the turret. If I was delighted before with my prospect, I was now<br>
ravished, for I was elevated above the room I was in before upwards of<br>
thirty feet. I seemed a little dizzy, for the turret being a lantern,<br>
and giving light all ways, for some time I thought myself suspended in<br>
the air; but sitting down, and having eat a mouthful of biscuit and<br>
drank a glass of sack, I soon recovered, and then the gentleman who had<br>
undertaken to convince me that the place I was shown was really London,<br>
thus began, after having drawn aside one of the windows.<br>
<br>
&quot;You see, my lady,&quot; says the gentleman, &quot;the greatest, the finest, the<br>
richest, and the most populous city in the world, at least in Europe, as<br>
I can assure your ladyship, upon my own knowledge, it deserves the<br>
character I have given it.&quot; &quot;But this, sir, will never convince me that<br>
the place you now show me is London, though I have before heard that<br>
London deserves the character you have with so much cordiality bestowed<br>
upon it. And this I can testify, that London, in every particular you<br>
have mentioned, greatly surpasses Paris, which is allowed by all<br>
historians and travellers to be the second city in Europe.&quot;<br>
<br>
Here the gentleman, pulling out his pocket-glass, desired me to look<br>
through it, which I did; and then he directed me to look full at St.<br>
Paul's, and to make that the centre of my future observation, and<br>
thereupon he promised me conviction.<br>
<br>
Whilst I took my observation, I sat in a high chair, made for that<br>
purpose, with a convenience before you to hold the glass. I soon found<br>
the cathedral, and then I could not help saying I have been several<br>
times up to the stone gallery, but not quite so often up to the iron<br>
gallery. Then I brought my eye to the Monument, and was obliged to<br>
confess I knew it to be such. The gentleman then moved the glass and<br>
desired me to look, which doing, I said, &quot;I think I see Whitehall and<br>
St. James's Park, and I see also two great buildings like barns, but I<br>
do not know what they are.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; says the gentleman, &quot;they are the<br>
Parliament House and Westminster Abbey.&quot; &quot;They may be so,&quot; said I; and<br>
continuing looking, I perceived the very house at Kensington which I had<br>
lived in some time; but of that I took no notice, yet I found my colour<br>
come, to think what a life of gaiety and wickedness I had lived. The<br>
gentleman, perceiving my disorder, said, &quot;I am afraid I have tired your<br>
ladyship; I will make but one remove, more easterly, and then I believe<br>
you will allow the place we see to be London.&quot;<br>
<br>
He might have saved himself the trouble, for I was thoroughly convinced<br>
of my error; but to give myself time to recover, and to hide my<br>
confusion, I seemed not yet to be quite convinced. I looked, and the<br>
first object that presented itself was Aldgate Church, which, though I<br>
confess to my shame, I seldom saw the inside of it, yet I was well<br>
acquainted with the outside, for many times my friend the Quaker and I<br>
had passed and repassed by it when we used to go in the coach to take an<br>
airing. I saw the church, or the steeple of the church, so plain, and<br>
knew it so well, that I could not help saying, with some earnestness,<br>
&quot;My dear, I see our church; the church, I mean, belonging to our<br>
neighbourhood; I am sure it is Aldgate Church.&quot; Then I saw the Tower,<br>
and all the shipping; and, taking my eye from the glass, I thanked the<br>
gentleman for the trouble I had given him, and said to him that I was<br>
fully convinced that the place I saw was London, and that it was the<br>
very place we came from that morning.<br>
<br>
When we came to Sittingbourne, our servant soon brought us word that<br>
although we were at the best inn in the town, yet there was nothing in<br>
the larder fit for our dinner. The landlord came in after him and began<br>
to make excuses for his empty cupboard. He told us, withal, that if we<br>
would please to stay, he would kill a calf, a sheep, a hog, or anything<br>
we had a fancy to. We ordered him to kill a pig and some pigeons, which,<br>
with a dish of fish, a cherry pie, and some pastry, made up a tolerable<br>
dinner. We made up two pounds ten shillings, for we caused the landlord,<br>
his wife, and two daughters, to dine with us, and help us off with our<br>
wine. Our landlady and her two daughters, with a glass or two given to<br>
the cook, managed two bottles of white wine. This operated so strong<br>
upon one of the young wenches that, my spouse being gone out into the<br>
yard, her tongue began to run; and, looking at me, she says to her<br>
mother, &quot;La! mother, how much like the lady her ladyship is&quot; (speaking<br>
of me), &quot;the young woman who lodged here the other night, and stayed<br>
here part of the next day, and then set forward for Canterbury,<br>
described. The lady is the same person, I'm sure.&quot;<br>
<br>
This greatly alarmed me, and made me very uneasy, for I concluded this<br>
young woman could be no other than my daughter, who was resolved to find<br>
me out, whether I would or no. I desired the girl to describe the young<br>
woman she mentioned, which she did, and I was convinced it was my own<br>
daughter. I asked in what manner she travelled, and whether she had any<br>
company. I was answered that she was on foot, and that she had no<br>
company; but that she always travelled from place to place in company;<br>
that her method was, when she came into any town, to go to the best inns<br>
and inquire for the lady she sought; and then, when she had satisfied<br>
herself that the lady, whom she called her mother, was not to be found<br>
in that town or neighbourhood, she then begged the favour of the<br>
landlady of the inn where she was, to put her into such a company that<br>
she knew that she might go safe to the next town; that this was the<br>
manner of her proceeding at her house, and she believed she had<br>
practised it ever since she set out from London; and she hoped to meet<br>
with her mother, as she called her, upon the road.<br>
<br>
I asked my landlady whether she described our coach and equipage, but<br>
she said the young woman did not inquire concerning equipage, but only<br>
described a lady &quot;so like your ladyship, that I have often, since I saw<br>
your ladyship, took you to be the very person she was looking for.&quot;<br>
<br>
Amidst the distractions of my mind, this afforded me some comfort, that<br>
my daughter was not in the least acquainted with the manner in which we<br>
travelled. My husband and the landlord returned, and that put an end to<br>
the discourse.<br>
<br>
I left this town with a heavy heart, feeling my daughter would<br>
infallibly find me out at Canterbury; but, as good luck would have it,<br>
she had left that city before we came thither, some time. I was very<br>
short in one thing, that I had not asked my landlady at Sittingbourne<br>
how long it was since my daughter was there. But when I came to<br>
Canterbury I was a very anxious and indefatigable in inquiring after my<br>
daughter, and I found that she had been at the inn where we then were,<br>
and had inquired for me, as I found by the description the people gave<br>
of myself.<br>
<br>
Here I learnt my daughter had left Canterbury a week. This pleased me;<br>
and I was determined to stay in Canterbury one day, to view the<br>
cathedral, and see the antiquities of this metropolis.<br>
<br>
As we had sixteen miles to our journey's end that night, for it was near<br>
four o'clock before we got into our coach again, the coachman drove with<br>
great speed, and at dusk in the evening we entered the west gate of the<br>
city, and put up at an inn in High Street (near St. Mary Bredman's<br>
church), which generally was filled with the best of company. The<br>
anxiety of my mind, on finding myself pursued by this girl, and the<br>
fatigue of my journey, had made me much out of order, my head ached, and<br>
I had no stomach.<br>
<br>
This made my husband (but he knew not the real occasion of my illness)<br>
and the Quaker very uneasy, and they did all in their power to persuade<br>
me to eat anything I could fancy.<br>
<br>
At length the landlady of the inn, who perceived I was more disturbed in<br>
my mind than sick, advised me to eat one poached egg, drink a glass of<br>
sack, eat a toast, and go to bed, and she warranted, she said, I should<br>
be well by the morning. This was immediately done; and I must<br>
acknowledge, that the sack and toast cheered me wonderfully, and I began<br>
to take heart again; and my husband would have the coachman in after<br>
supper, on purpose to divert me and the honest Quaker, who, poor<br>
creature, seemed much more concerned at my misfortune than I was myself.<br>
<br>
I went soon to bed, but for fear I should be worse in the night, two<br>
maids of the inn were ordered to sit up in an adjoining chamber; the<br>
Quaker and my waiting-maid lay in a bed in the same room, and my<br>
husband by himself in another apartment.<br>
<br>
While my maid was gone down on some necessary business, and likewise to<br>
get me some burnt wine, which I was to drink going to bed, or rather<br>
when I was just got into bed, the Quaker and I had the following<br>
dialogue:<br>
<br>
_Quaker._ The news thou heardest at Sittingbourne has disordered thee. I<br>
am glad the young woman has been out of this place a week; she went<br>
indeed for Dover; and when she comes there and canst not find thee, she<br>
may go to Deal, and so miss of thee.<br>
<br>
_Roxana._ What I most depend upon is, that as we do not travel by any<br>
particular name, but the general one of the baronet and his lady, and<br>
the girl hath no notion what sort of equipage we travelled with, it was<br>
not easy to make a discovery of me, unless she accidentally, in her<br>
travels, light upon you (meaning the Quaker), or upon me; either of<br>
which must unavoidably blow the secret I had so long laboured to<br>
conceal.<br>
<br>
_Quaker._ As thou intendest to stay here to-morrow, to see the things<br>
which thou callest antiquities, and which are more properly named the<br>
relics of the Whore of Babylon; suppose thou wert to send Thomas, who at<br>
thy command followeth after us, to the place called Dover, to inquire<br>
whether such a young woman has been inquiring for thee. He may go out<br>
betimes in the morning, and may return by night, for it is but twelve<br>
or fourteen miles at farthest thither.<br>
<br>
_Roxana._ I like thy scheme very well; and I beg the favour of you in<br>
the morning, as soon as you are up, to send Tom to Dover, with such<br>
instructions as you shall think proper.<br>
<br>
After a good night's repose I was well recovered, to the great<br>
satisfaction of all that were with me.<br>
<br>
The good-natured Quaker, always studious to serve and oblige me, got up<br>
about five o'clock in the morning, and going down into the inn-yard, met<br>
with Tom, gave him his instructions, and he set out for Dover before six<br>
o'clock.<br>
<br>
As we were at the best inn in the city, so we could readily have<br>
whatever we pleased, and whatever the season afforded; but my husband,<br>
the most indulgent man that ever breathed, having observed how heartily<br>
I ate my dinner at Rochester two days before, ordered the very same bill<br>
of fare, and of which I made a heartier meal than I did before. We were<br>
very merry, and after we had dined, we went to see the town-house, but<br>
as it was near five o'clock I left the Quaker behind me, to receive what<br>
intelligence she could get concerning my daughter, from the footman, who<br>
was expected to return from Dover at six.<br>
<br>
We came to the inn just as it was dark, and then excusing myself to my<br>
husband, I immediately ran up into my chamber, where I had appointed the<br>
Quaker to be against my return. I ran to her with eagerness, and<br>
inquired what news from Dover, by Tom, the footman.<br>
<br>
She said, Tom had been returned two hours; that he got to Dover that<br>
morning between seven and eight, and found, at the inn he put up at,<br>
there had been an inquisitive young woman to find out a gentleman that<br>
was a Dutch merchant, and a lady who was her mother; that the young<br>
woman perfectly well described his lady; that he found that she had<br>
visited every public inn in the town; that she said she would go to<br>
Deal, and that if she did not find the lady, her mother, there, she<br>
would go by the first ship to the Hague, and go from thence, to<br>
Amsterdam and Rotterdam, searching all the towns through which she<br>
passed in the United Provinces.<br>
<br>
This account pleased me very well, especially when I understood that she<br>
had been gone from Dover five days. The Quaker comforted me, and said it<br>
was lucky this busy creature had passed the road before us, otherwise<br>
she might easily have found means to have overtaken us, for, as she<br>
observed, the wench had such an artful way of telling her story, that<br>
she moved everybody to compassion; and she did not doubt but that if we<br>
had been before, as we were behind, she would have got those who would<br>
have assisted her with a coach, &amp;c., to have pursued us, and they might<br>
have come up with us.<br>
<br>
I was of the honest Quaker's sentiments. I grew pretty easy, called Tom,<br>
and gave him half a guinea for his diligence; then I and the Quaker went<br>
into the parlour to my husband, and soon after supper came in, and I<br>
ate moderately, and we spent the remainder of the evening, for the clock<br>
had then tolled nine, very cheerfully; for my Quaker was so rejoiced at<br>
my good fortune, as she called it, that she was very alert, and<br>
exceeding good company; and her wit, and she had no small share of it, I<br>
thought was better played off than ever I had heard it before.<br>
<br>
My husband asked me how I should choose to go on board; I desired him to<br>
settle it as he pleased, telling him it was a matter of very great<br>
indifference to me, as he was to go with me. &quot;That may be true, my<br>
dear,&quot; says he, &quot;but I ask you for a reason or two, which I will lay<br>
before you, viz., if we hire a vessel for ourselves, we may set sail<br>
when we please, have the liberty of every part of the ship to ourselves,<br>
and land at what port, either in Holland or France, we might make choice<br>
of. Besides,&quot; added he, &quot;another reason I mention it to you is, that I<br>
know you do not love much company, which, in going into the packet-boat,<br>
it is almost impossible to avoid.&quot; &quot;I own, my dear,&quot; said I, &quot;your<br>
reasons are very good; I have but one thing to say against them, which<br>
is, that the packet-boat, by its frequent voyages, must of course be<br>
furnished with experienced seamen, who know the seas too well even to<br>
run any hazard.&quot; (At this juncture the terrible voyage I and Amy made<br>
from France to Harwich came so strong in my mind, that I trembled so as<br>
to be taken notice of by my husband.) &quot;Besides,&quot; added I, &quot;the landlord<br>
may send the master of one of them to you, and I think it may be best to<br>
hire the state cabin, as they call it, to ourselves, by which method we<br>
shall avoid company, without we have an inclination to associate<br>
ourselves with such passengers we may happen to like; and the expense<br>
will be much cheaper than hiring a vessel to go the voyage with us<br>
alone, and every whit as safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Quaker, who had seriously listened to our discourse, gave it as her<br>
opinion that the method I had proposed was by far the safest, quickest,<br>
and cheapest. &quot;Not,&quot; said she, &quot;as I think thou wouldest be against any<br>
necessary expense, though I am certain thou wouldest not fling thy money<br>
away.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soon after, my husband ordered the landlord to send for one of the<br>
masters of the packet-boats, of whom he hired the great cabin, and<br>
agreed to sail from thence the next day, if the wind and the tide<br>
answered.<br>
<br>
The settling our method of going over sea had taken up the time till the<br>
dinner was ready, which we being informed of, came out of a chamber we<br>
had been in all the morning, to a handsome parlour, where everything was<br>
placed suitable to our rank; there was a large, old-fashioned service of<br>
plate, and a sideboard genteelly set off. The dinner was excellent, and<br>
well dressed.<br>
<br>
After dinner, we entered into another discourse, which was the hiring of<br>
servants to go with us from Dover to Paris; a thing frequently done by<br>
travellers; and such are to be met with at every stage inn. Our footmen<br>
set out this morning on their return to London, and the Quaker and coach<br>
was to go the next day. My new chambermaid, whose name was Isabel, was<br>
to go through the journey, on condition of doing no other business than<br>
waiting on me. In a while we partly concluded to let the hiring of<br>
men-servants alone till we came to Calais, for they could be of no use<br>
to us on board a ship, the sailor's or cabin boy's place being to attend<br>
the cabin passengers as well as his master.<br>
<br>
To divert ourselves, we took a walk after we had dined, round about the<br>
town, and coming to the garrison, and being somewhat thirsty, all went<br>
into the sutler's for a glass of wine. A pint was called for and<br>
brought; but the man of the house came in with it raving like a madman,<br>
saying, &quot;Don't you think you are a villain, to ask for a pot of ale when<br>
I know you have spent all your money, and are ignorant of the means of<br>
getting more, without you hear of a place, which I look upon to be very<br>
unlikely?&quot; &quot;Don't be in such a passion, landlord,&quot; said my husband.<br>
&quot;Pray, what is the matter?&quot; &quot;Oh, nothing, sir,&quot; says he; &quot;but a young<br>
fellow in the sutling room, whom I find to have been a gentleman's<br>
servant, wants a place; and having spent all his money, would willingly<br>
run up a score with me, knowing I must get him a master if ever I intend<br>
to have my money.&quot; &quot;Pray, sir,&quot; said my husband, &quot;send the young fellow<br>
to me; if I like him, and can agree with him, it is possible I may take<br>
him into my service.&quot; The landlord took care we should not speak to him<br>
twice, he went and fetched him in himself, and my husband examined him<br>
before he spoke, as to his size, mien, and garb. The young man was clean<br>
dressed, of a middling stature, a dark complexion, and about<br>
twenty-seven years old.<br>
<br>
&quot;I hear, young man,&quot; says he to him, &quot;that you want a place; it may<br>
perhaps be in my power to serve you. Let me know at once what education<br>
you have had, if you have any family belonging to you, or if you are fit<br>
for a gentleman's service, can bring any person of reputation to your<br>
character, and are willing to go and live in Holland with me: we will<br>
not differ about your wages.&quot;<br>
<br>
The young fellow made a respectful bow to each of us, and addressed<br>
himself to my husband as follows: &quot;Sir,&quot; said he, &quot;in me you behold the<br>
eldest child of misfortune. I am but young, as you may see; I have no<br>
comers after me, and having lived with several gentlemen, some of whom<br>
are on their travels, others settled in divers parts of the world,<br>
besides what are dead, makes me unable to produce a character without a<br>
week's notice to write to London, and I should not doubt but by the<br>
return of the post to let you see some letters as would satisfy you in<br>
any doubts about me. My education,&quot; continued he, &quot;is but very middling,<br>
being taken from school before I had well learnt to read, write, and<br>
cast accounts; and as to my parentage, I cannot well give you any<br>
account of them: all that I know is, that my father was a brewer, and by<br>
his extravagance ran out a handsome fortune, and afterwards left my poor<br>
mother almost penniless, with five small children, of which I was the<br>
second, though not above five years old. My mother knew not what to do<br>
with us, so she sent a poor girl, our maid, whose name I have forgot<br>
this many years, with us all to a relation's, and there left us, and I<br>
never saw or heard of or from them any more. Indeed, I inquired among<br>
the neighbours, and all that I could learn was that my mother's goods<br>
were seized, that she was obliged to apply to the parish for relief, and<br>
died of grief soon after. For my part,&quot; says he, &quot;I was put into the<br>
hands of my father's sister, where, by her cruel usage, I was forced to<br>
run away at nine years of age; and the numerous scenes of life I have<br>
since gone through are more than would fill a small volume. Pray, sir,&quot;<br>
added he, &quot;let it satisfy you that I am thoroughly honest, and should be<br>
glad to serve you at any rate; and although I cannot possibly get a good<br>
character from anybody at present, yet I defy the whole world to give me<br>
an ill one, either in public or private life.&quot;<br>
<br>
If I had had the eyes of Argus I should have seen with them all on this<br>
occasion. I knew that this was my son, and one that, among all my<br>
inquiry, I could never get any account of. The Quaker seeing my colour<br>
come and go, and also tremble, said, &quot;I verily believe thou art not<br>
well; I hope this Kentish air, which was always reckoned aguish, does<br>
not hurt thee?&quot; &quot;I am taken very sick of a sudden,&quot; said I; &quot;so pray let<br>
me go to our inn that I may go to my chamber.&quot; Isabel being called in,<br>
she and the Quaker attended me there, leaving the young fellow with my<br>
spouse. When I was got into my chamber I was seized with such a grief as<br>
I had never known before; and flinging myself down upon the bed, burst<br>
into a flood of tears, and soon after fainted away. Soon after, I came a<br>
little to myself, and the Quaker begged of me to tell her what was the<br>
cause of my sudden indisposition. &quot;Nothing at all,&quot; says I, &quot;as I know<br>
of; but a sudden chilliness seized my blood, and that, joined to a<br>
fainting of the spirits, made me ready to sink.&quot;<br>
<br>
Presently after my husband came to see how I did, and finding me<br>
somewhat better, he told me that he had a mind to hire the young man I<br>
had left him with, for he believed he was honest and fit for our<br>
service. &quot;My dear,&quot; says I, &quot;I did not mind him. I would desire you to<br>
be cautious who we pick up on the road; but as I have the satisfaction<br>
of hiring my maids, I shall never trouble myself with the men-servants,<br>
that is wholly your province. However,&quot; added I (for I was very certain<br>
he was my son, and was resolved to have him in my service, though it was<br>
my interest to keep my husband off, in order to bring him on), &quot;if you<br>
like the fellow, I am not averse to your hiring one servant in England.<br>
We are not obliged to trust him with much before we see his conduct,<br>
and if he does not prove as you may expect, you may turn him off<br>
whenever you please.&quot; &quot;I believe,&quot; said my husband, &quot;he has been<br>
ingenuous in his relation to me; and as a man who has seen great variety<br>
of life, and may have been the shuttlecock of fortune, the butt of envy,<br>
and the mark of malice, I will hire him when he comes to me here anon,<br>
as I have ordered him.&quot;<br>
<br>
As I knew he was to be hired, I resolved to be out of the way when he<br>
came to my husband; so about five o'clock I proposed to the Quaker to<br>
take a walk on the pier and see the shipping, while the tea-kettle was<br>
boiling. We went, and took Isabel with us, and as we were going along I<br>
saw my son Thomas (as I shall for the future call him) going to our inn;<br>
so we stayed out about an hour, and when we returned my husband told me<br>
he had hired the man, and that he was to come to him as a servant on the<br>
morrow morning. &quot;Pray, my dear,&quot; said I, &quot;did you ask where he ever<br>
lived, or what his name is?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied my husband, &quot;he says his<br>
name is Thomas ----; and as to places, he has mentioned several families<br>
of note, and among others, he lived at my Lord ----'s, next door to the<br>
great French lady's in Pall Mall, whose name he tells me was Roxana.&quot; I<br>
was now in a sad dilemma, and was fearful I should be known by my own<br>
son; and the Quaker took notice of it, and afterwards told me she<br>
believed fortune had conspired that all the people I became acquainted<br>
with, should have known the Lady Roxana. &quot;I warrant,&quot; said she, &quot;this<br>
young fellow is somewhat acquainted with the impertinent wench that<br>
calls herself thy daughter.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was very uneasy in mind, but had one thing in my favour, which was<br>
always to keep myself at a very great distance from my servants; and as<br>
the Quaker was to part with us the next day or night, he would have<br>
nobody to mention the name Roxana to, and so of course it would drop.<br>
<br>
We supped pretty late at night, and were very merry, for my husband said<br>
all the pleasant things he could think of, to divert me from the<br>
supposed illness he thought I had been troubled with in the day. The<br>
Quaker kept up the discourse with great spirit, and I was glad to<br>
receive the impression, for I wanted the real illness to be drove out of<br>
my head.<br>
<br>
The next morning, after breakfast, Thomas came to his new place. He<br>
appeared very clean, and brought with him a small bundle, which I<br>
supposed to be linen tied up in a handkerchief. My husband sent him to<br>
order some porters belonging to the quay to fetch our boxes to the<br>
Custom-house, where they were searched, for which we paid one shilling;<br>
and he had orders to give a crown for head money, as they called it;<br>
their demand by custom is but sixpence a head, but we appeared to our<br>
circumstances in everything. As soon as our baggage was searched, it was<br>
carried from the Custom-house on board the packet-boat, and there<br>
lodged in the great cabin as we had ordered it.<br>
<br>
This took up the time till dinner, and when we were sitting together<br>
after we had both dined, the captain came to tell us that the wind was<br>
very fair, and that he was to sail at high water, which would be about<br>
ten o'clock at night. My husband asked him to stay and drink part of a<br>
bottle of wine with him, which he did; and their discourse being all in<br>
the maritime strain, the Quaker and I retired and left them together,<br>
for I had something to remind her of in our discourse before we left<br>
London. When we got into the garden, which was rather neat than fine, I<br>
repeated all my former requests to her about my children, Spitalfields,<br>
Amy, &amp;c., and we sat talking together till Thomas was sent to tell us<br>
the captain was going, on which we returned; but, by the way, I kissed<br>
her and put a large gold medal into her hand, as a token of my sincere<br>
love, and desired that she would never neglect the things she had<br>
promised to perform, and her repeated promise gave me great<br>
satisfaction.<br>
<br>
The captain, who was going out of the parlour as we returned in, was<br>
telling my husband he would send six of his hands to conduct us to the<br>
boat, about a quarter of an hour before he sailed, and as the moon was<br>
at the full, he did not doubt of a pleasant passage.<br>
<br>
Our next business was to pay off the coachman, to whom my husband gave<br>
half a guinea extraordinary, to set the Quaker down at the house he<br>
took us all up at, which he promised to perform.<br>
<br>
As it was low water, we went on board to see the cabin that we were to<br>
go our voyage in, and the captain would detain us to drink a glass of<br>
the best punch, I think, I ever tasted.<br>
<br>
When we returned to the inn, we ordered supper to be ready by eight<br>
o'clock, that we might drink a parting glass to settle it, before we<br>
went on board; for my husband, who knew the sea very well, said a full<br>
stomach was the forerunner of sea-sickness, which I was willing to<br>
avoid.<br>
<br>
We invited the landlord, his wife, and daughter, to supper with us, and<br>
having sat about an hour afterwards, the captain himself, with several<br>
sailors, came to fetch us to the vessel. As all was paid, we had nothing<br>
to hinder us but taking a final leave of the Quaker, who would go to see<br>
us safe in the vessel, where tears flowed from both our eyes; and I<br>
turned short in the boat, while my husband took his farewell, and he<br>
then followed me, and I never saw the Quaker or England any more.<br>
<br>
We were no sooner on board than we hoisted sail; the anchors being up,<br>
and the wind fair, we cut the waves at a great rate, till about four<br>
o'clock in the morning, when a French boat came to fetch the mail to<br>
carry it to the post-house, and the boat cast her anchors, for we were a<br>
good distance from the shore, neither could we sail to the town till<br>
next tide, the present one being too far advanced in the ebb.<br>
<br>
We might have gone on shore in the boat that carried the mail, but my<br>
husband was sleeping in the cabin when it came to the packet-boat, and I<br>
did not care to disturb him; however, we had an opportunity soon after,<br>
for my husband awaking, and two other boats coming up with oars to see<br>
for passengers, Thomas came to let us know we might go on shore, if we<br>
pleased. My husband paid the master of the packet-boat for our passage,<br>
and Thomas, with the sailors' assistance, got our boxes into the wherry,<br>
so we sailed for Calais; but before our boat came to touch ground,<br>
several men, whose bread I suppose it is, rushed into the water, without<br>
shoes or stockings, to carry us on shore; so having paid ten shillings<br>
for the wherry, we each of us was carried from the boat to the land by<br>
two men, and our goods brought after us; here was a crown to be paid, to<br>
save ourselves from being wet, by all which a man that is going a<br>
travelling may see that it is not the bare expense of the packet-boat<br>
that will carry him to Calais.<br>
<br>
It would be needless to inform the reader of all the ceremonies that we<br>
passed through at this place before we were suffered to proceed on our<br>
journey; however, our boxes having been searched at the Custom-house, my<br>
husband had them plumbed, as they called it, to hinder any further<br>
inquiry about them; and we got them all to the Silver Lion, a noted inn,<br>
and the post-house of this place, where we took a stage-coach for<br>
ourselves, and the next morning, having well refreshed ourselves, we<br>
all, viz., my husband, self, and chambermaid within the coach, and<br>
Thomas behind (beside which my husband hired two horsemen well armed,<br>
who were pretty expensive, to travel with us), set forward on our<br>
journey.<br>
<br>
We were five days on our journey from Calais to Paris, which we went<br>
through with much satisfaction, for, having fine weather and good<br>
attendance, we had nothing to hope for.<br>
<br>
When we arrived at Paris (I began to be sorry I had ever proposed going<br>
to it for fear of being known, but as we were to stay there but a few<br>
days, I was resolved to keep very retired), we went to a merchant's<br>
house of my husband's acquaintance in the Rue de la Bourle, near the<br>
Carmelites, in the Faubourg de St. Jacques.<br>
<br>
This being a remote part of the city, on the south side, and near<br>
several pleasant gardens, I thought it would be proper to be a little<br>
indisposed, that my husband might not press me to go with him to see the<br>
curiosities; for he could do the most needful business, such as going to<br>
the bankers to exchange bills, despatching of letters, settling affairs<br>
with merchants, &amp;c., without my assistance; and I had a tolerable plea<br>
for my conduct, such as the great fatigue of our journey, being among<br>
strangers, &amp;c.; so we stayed at Paris eight days without my going to any<br>
particular places, except going one day to the gardens of Luxembourg,<br>
another to the church of Notre Dame on the Isle of Paris, a third to the<br>
H&ocirc;tel Royale des Invalides, a fourth to the gardens of the Tuileries, a<br>
fifth to the suburbs of St. Lawrence, to see the fair which was then<br>
holding there; a sixth to the gardens of the Louvre, a seventh to the<br>
playhouse, and the eighth stayed all day at home to write a letter to<br>
the Quaker, letting her know where I then was, and how soon we should go<br>
forwards in our journey, but did not mention where we intended to<br>
settle, as, indeed, we had not yet settled that ourselves.<br>
<br>
One of the days, viz., that in which I went to the gardens of the<br>
Tuileries, I asked Thomas several questions about his father, mother,<br>
and other relations, being resolved, notwithstanding he was my own son,<br>
as he did not know it, to turn him off by some stratagem or another, if<br>
he had any manner of memory of me, either as his mother, or the Lady<br>
Roxana. I asked him if he had any particular memory of his mother or<br>
father; he answered, &quot;No, I scarce remember anything of either of them,&quot;<br>
said he, &quot;but I have heard from several people that I had one brother<br>
and three sisters, though I never saw them all, to know them,<br>
notwithstanding I lived with an aunt four years; I often asked after my<br>
mother, and some people said she went away with a man, but it was<br>
allowed by most people, that best knew her, that she, being brought to<br>
the greatest distress, was carried to the workhouse belonging to the<br>
parish, where she died soon after with grief.&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing could give me more satisfaction than what Thomas had related; so<br>
now, I thought I would ask about the Lady Roxana (for he had been my<br>
next-door neighbour when I had that title conferred on me). &quot;Pray,<br>
Thomas,&quot; said I, &quot;did not you speak of a great person of quality, whose<br>
name I have forgot, that lived next door to my Lord ----'s when you was<br>
his valet? pray who was she? I suppose a foreigner, by the name you<br>
called her.&quot; &quot;Really, my lady,&quot; replied he, &quot;I do not know who she was;<br>
all I can say of her is, that she kept the greatest company, and was a<br>
beautiful woman, by report, but I never saw her; she was called the Lady<br>
Roxana, was a very good mistress, but her character was not so good as<br>
to private life as it ought to be. Though I once had an opportunity,&quot;<br>
continued he, &quot;of seeing a fine outlandish dress she danced in before<br>
the king, which I took as a great favour, for the cook took me up when<br>
the lady was out, and she desired my lady's woman to show it to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
All this answered right, and I had nothing to do but to keep my Turkish<br>
dress out of the way, to be myself unknown to my child, for as he had<br>
never seen Roxana, so he knew nothing of me.<br>
<br>
In the interval, my husband had hired a stage-coach to carry us to the<br>
city of Menin, where he intended to go by water down the river Lys to<br>
Ghent, and there take coach to Isabella fort, opposite the city of<br>
Anvers, and cross the river to that place, and go from thence by land to<br>
Breda; and as he had agreed and settled this patrol, I was satisfied,<br>
and we set out next day. We went through several handsome towns and<br>
villages before we took water, but by water we went round part of the<br>
city of Courtrai, and several fortified towns. At Anvers we hired a<br>
coach to Breda, where we stayed two days to refresh ourselves, for we<br>
had been very much fatigued; as Willemstadt was situated so as to be<br>
convenient for our taking water for Rotterdam, we went there, and being<br>
shipped, had a safe and speedy voyage to that city.<br>
<br>
As we had resolved in our journey to settle at the Hague, we did not<br>
intend to stay any longer at Rotterdam, than while my husband had all<br>
our wealth delivered to him from the several merchants he had consigned<br>
it to. This business took up a month, during which time we lived in<br>
ready-furnished lodgings on the Great Quay, where all the respect was<br>
shown us as was due to our quality.<br>
<br>
Here my husband hired two more men-servants, and I took two maids, and<br>
turned Isabel, who was a well-bred, agreeable girl, into my companion;<br>
but that I might not be too much fatigued, my husband went to the Hague<br>
first, and left me, with three maids and Thomas, at Rotterdam, while he<br>
took a house, furnished it, and had everything ready for my reception,<br>
which was done with great expedition. One of his footmen came with a<br>
letter to me one morning, to let me know his master would come by the<br>
scow next day to take me home, in which he desired that I would prepare<br>
for my departure. I soon got everything ready, and the next morning, on<br>
the arrival of the scow, I saw my husband; and we both, with all the<br>
servants, left the city of Rotterdam, and safely got to the Hague the<br>
afternoon following.<br>
<br>
It was now the servants had notice given them to call me by the name of<br>
&quot;my lady,&quot; as the honour of baronetage had entitled me, and with which<br>
title I was pretty well satisfied, but should have been more so had not<br>
I yet the higher title of countess in view.<br>
<br>
I now lived in a place where I knew nobody, neither was I known, on<br>
which I was pretty careful whom I became acquainted with; our<br>
circumstances were very good, my husband loving, to the greatest degree,<br>
my servants respectful; and, in short, I lived the happiest life woman<br>
could enjoy, had my former crimes never crept into my guilty conscience.<br>
<br>
I was in this happy state of life when I wrote a letter to the Quaker,<br>
in which I gave her a direction where she might send to me. And about a<br>
fortnight after, as I was one afternoon stepping into my coach in order<br>
to take an airing, the postman came to our door with letters, one of<br>
which was directed to me, and as soon as I saw it was the Quaker's hand,<br>
I bid the coachman put up again, and went into my closet to read the<br>
contents, which were as follows:<br>
<br>
 &quot;DEAR FRIEND,--I have had occasion to write to thee several times<br>
 since we saw each other, but as this is my first letter, so it<br>
 shall contain all the business thou wouldst know. I got safe to<br>
 London, by thy careful ordering of the coach, and the attendants<br>
 were not at all wanting in their duty. When I had been at home a<br>
 few days, thy woman, Mrs. Amy, came to see me, so I took her to<br>
 task as thou ordered me, about murdering thy pretended daughter;<br>
 she declared her innocence, but said she had procured a false<br>
 evidence to swear a large debt against her, and by that means had<br>
 put her into a prison, and fee'd the keepers to hinder her from<br>
 sending any letter or message out of the prison to any person<br>
 whatever. This, I suppose, was the reason thou thought she was<br>
 murdered, because thou wert relieved from her by this base usage.<br>
 However, when I heard of it, I checked Amy very much, but was well<br>
 satisfied to hear she was alive. After this I did not hear from Amy<br>
 for above a month, and in the interim (as I knew thou wast safe), I<br>
 sent a friend of mine to pay the debt, and release the prisoner,<br>
 which he did, but was so indiscreet as to let her know who was the<br>
 benefactress. My next care was to manage thy Spitalfields business,<br>
 which I did with much exactness. And the day that I received thy<br>
 last letter, Amy came to me again, and I read as much of it to her<br>
 as she was concerned in: nay, I entreated her to drink tea with me,<br>
 and after it one glass of citron, in which she drank towards thy<br>
 good health, and she told me she would come to see thee as soon as<br>
 possible. Just as she was gone, I was reading thy letter again in<br>
 the little parlour, and that turbulent creature (thy pretended<br>
 daughter) came to me, as she said, to return thanks for the favour<br>
 I had done her, so I accidentally laid thy letter down in the<br>
 window, while I went to fetch her a glass of cordial, for she<br>
 looked sadly; and before I returned I heard the street door shut,<br>
 on which I went back without the liquor, not knowing who might have<br>
 come in, but missing her, I thought she might be gone to stand at<br>
 the door, and the wind had blown it to; but I was never the nearer,<br>
 she was sought for in vain. So when I believed her to be quite<br>
 gone, I looked to see if I missed anything, which I did not; but at<br>
 last, to my great surprise, I missed your letter, which she<br>
 certainly took and made off with. I was so terrified at this<br>
 unhappy chance that I fainted away, and had not one of my maidens<br>
 come in at that juncture, it might have been attended with fatal<br>
 consequences. I would advise thee to prepare thyself to see her,<br>
 for I verily believe she will come to thee. I dread your knowing of<br>
 this, but hope the best. Before I went to fetch the unhappy<br>
 cordial, she told me, as she had often done before, that she was<br>
 the eldest daughter, that the captain's wife was your second<br>
 daughter, and her sister, and that the youngest sister was dead.<br>
 She also said there were two brothers, the eldest of whom had never<br>
 been seen by any of them since he run away from an uncle's at nine<br>
 years of age, and that the youngest had been taken care of by an<br>
 old lady that kept her coach, whom he took to be his godmother. She<br>
 gave me a long history in what manner she was arrested and flung<br>
 into Whitechapel jail, how hardly she fared there; and at length<br>
 the keeper's wife, to whom she told her pitiful story, took<br>
 compassion of her, and recommended her to the bounty of a certain<br>
 lady who lived in that neighbourhood, that redeemed prisoners for<br>
 small sums, and who lay for their fees, every return of the day of<br>
 her nativity; that she was one of the six the lady had discharged;<br>
 that the lady prompted her to seek after her mother; that she<br>
 thereupon did seek thee in all the towns and villages between<br>
 London and Dover; that not finding thee at Dover she went to Deal;<br>
 and that at length, she being tired of seeking thee, she returned<br>
 by shipping to London, where she was no sooner arrived but she was<br>
 immediately arrested and flung into the Marshalsea prison, where<br>
 she lived in a miserable condition, without the use of pen, ink,<br>
 and paper, and without the liberty of having any one of her friends<br>
 come near her. 'In this condition I was,' continued she, 'when you<br>
 sent and paid my debt for me, and discharged me.' When she had<br>
 related all this she fell into such a fit of crying, sighing, and<br>
 sobbing, from which, when she was a little recovered, she broke out<br>
 into loud exclamations against the wickedness of the people in<br>
 England, that they could be so unchristian as to arrest her twice,<br>
 when she said it was as true as the Gospel that she never did owe<br>
 to any one person the sum of one shilling in all her life; that she<br>
 could not think who it was that should owe her so much ill-will,<br>
 for that she was not conscious to herself that she had any ways<br>
 offended any person in the whole universal world, except Mrs. Amy,<br>
 in the case of her mother, which, she affirmed, she was acquitted<br>
 of by all men, and hoped she should be so by her Maker; and that if<br>
 she (Mrs. Amy) had any hand in her sufferings, God would forgive<br>
 her, as she heartily did. 'But then,' she added, 'I will not stay<br>
 in England, I will go all over the world, I will go to France, to<br>
 Paris; I know my mother did once live there, and if I do not find<br>
 her there, I will go through Holland, to Amsterdam, to Rotterdam;<br>
 in short, I will go till I find my mother out, if I should die in<br>
 the pursuit.' I should be glad to hear of thine and thy spouse's<br>
 welfare, and remain with much sincerity, your sincere friend,<br>
<br>
 &quot;M.P.<br>
<br>
 &quot;The ninth of the month called October.<br>
<br>
 &quot;P.S.--If thou hast any business to transact in this city, pray let<br>
 me know; I shall use my best endeavours to oblige thee; my<br>
 daughters all join with me in willing thee a hearty farewell.&quot;<br>
<br>
I concealed my surprise for a few minutes, only till I could get into<br>
the summer-house, at the bottom of our large garden; but when I was shut<br>
in, no living soul can describe the agony I was in, I raved, tore,<br>
fainted away, swore, prayed, wished, cried, and promised, but all<br>
availed nothing, I was now stuck in to see the worst of it, let what<br>
would happen.<br>
<br>
At last I came to the following resolution, which was to write a letter<br>
to the Quaker, and in it enclose a fifty pound bank-bill, and tell the<br>
Quaker to give that to the young woman if she called again, and also to<br>
let her know a fifty pound bill should be sent her every year, so long<br>
as she made no inquiry after me, and kept herself retired in England.<br>
Although this opened myself too full to the Quaker, yet I thought I had<br>
better venture my character abroad, than destroy my peace at home.<br>
<br>
Soon after, my husband came home, and he perceived I had been crying,<br>
and asked what was the reason. I told him that I had shed tears both<br>
for joy and sorrow: &quot;For,&quot; said I, &quot;I have received one of the<br>
tenderest letters from Amy, as it was possible for any person, and she<br>
tells me in it,&quot; added I, &quot;that she will soon come to see me; which so<br>
overjoyed me, that I cried, and after it, I went to read the letter a<br>
second time, as I was looking out of the summer-house window over the<br>
canal; and in unfolding it, I accidentally let it fall in, by which<br>
mischance it is lost, for which I am very sorry, as I intended you<br>
should see it.&quot; &quot;Pray, my dear,&quot; said he, &quot;do not let that give you any<br>
uneasiness; if Amy comes, and you approve of it, you have my consent to<br>
take her into the house, in what capacity you please. I am very glad,&quot;<br>
continued he, &quot;that you have nothing of more consequence to be uneasy<br>
at, I fancy you would make but an indifferent helpmate if you had.&quot; Oh!<br>
thought I to myself, if you but knew half the things that lie on my<br>
conscience, I believe you would think that I bear them out past all<br>
example.<br>
<br>
About ten days afterwards, as we were sitting at dinner with two<br>
gentlemen, one of the footmen came to the door, and said, &quot;My lady, here<br>
is a gentlewoman at the door who desires to speak with you: she says her<br>
name is Mrs. Amy.&quot;<br>
<br>
I no sooner heard her name, but I was ready to swoon away, but I ordered<br>
the footman to call Isabel, and ask the gentlewoman to walk up with her<br>
into my dressing-room; which he immediately did, and there I went to<br>
have my first interview with her. She kissed me for joy when she saw<br>
me, and I sent Isabel downstairs, for I was in pain till I had some<br>
private conversation with my old confidante.<br>
<br>
There was not much ceremony between us, before I told her all the<br>
material circumstances that had happened in her absence, especially<br>
about the girl's imprisonments which she had contrived, and how she had<br>
got my letter at the Quaker's, the very day she had been there. &quot;Well,&quot;<br>
says Amy, when I had told her all, &quot;I find nothing is to ensue, if she<br>
lives, but your ruin; you would not agree to her death, so I will not<br>
make myself uneasy about her life; it might have been rectified, but you<br>
were angry with me for giving you the best of counsel, viz., when I<br>
proposed to murder her.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hussy,&quot; said I, in the greatest passion imaginable, &quot;how dare you<br>
mention the word murder? You wretch you, I could find in my heart, if my<br>
husband and the company were gone, to kick you out of my house. Have you<br>
not done enough to kill her, in throwing her into one of the worst jails<br>
in England, where, you see, that Providence in a peculiar manner<br>
appeared to her assistance. Away! thou art a wicked wretch; thou art a<br>
murderer in the sight of God.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will say no more,&quot; says Amy, &quot;but if I could have found her, after<br>
thy friend the Quaker had discharged her out of the Marshalsea prison, I<br>
had laid a scheme to have her taken up for a theft, and by that means<br>
got her transported for fourteen years. She will be with you soon, I am<br>
sure; I believe she is now in Holland.&quot;<br>
<br>
While we were in this discourse, I found the gentlemen who dined with us<br>
were going, so we came downstairs, and I went into the parlour to take<br>
leave of them before their departure. When they were gone, my husband<br>
told me he had been talking with them about taking upon him the title of<br>
Count or Earl of ----, as he had told me of, and as an opportunity now<br>
offered, he was going to put it in execution.<br>
<br>
I told him I was so well settled, as not to want anything this world<br>
could afford me, except the continuance of his life and love (though the<br>
very thing he had mentioned, joined with the death of my daughter, in<br>
the natural way, would have been much more to my satisfaction). &quot;Well,<br>
my dear,&quot; says he, &quot;the expense will be but small, and as I promised you<br>
the title, it shall not be long before the honour shall be brought home<br>
to your toilette.&quot; He was as good as his word, for that day week he<br>
brought the patent home to me, in a small box covered with crimson<br>
velvet and two gold hinges. &quot;There, my lady countess,&quot; says he, &quot;long<br>
may you live to bear the title, for I am certain you are a credit to<br>
it.&quot; In a few days after, I had the pleasure to see our equipage, as<br>
coach, chariot, &amp;c., all new painted, and a coronet fixed at the proper<br>
place, and, in short, everything was proportioned to our quality, so<br>
that our house vied with most of the other nobility.<br>
<br>
It was at this juncture that I was at the pinnacle of all my worldly<br>
felicity, notwithstanding my soul was black with the foulest crimes.<br>
And, at the same time, I may begin to reckon the beginning of my<br>
misfortunes, which were in embryo, but were very soon brought forth, and<br>
hurried me on to the greatest distress.<br>
<br>
As I was sitting one day talking to Amy in our parlour, and the street<br>
door being left open by one of the servants, I saw my daughter pass by<br>
the window, and without any ceremony she came to the parlour door, and<br>
opening of it, came boldly in. I was terribly amazed, and asked her who<br>
she wanted, as if I had not known her, but Amy's courage was quite lost,<br>
and she swooned away. &quot;Your servant, my lady,&quot; says she; &quot;I thought I<br>
should never have had the happiness to see you _t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te_, till your<br>
agent, the Quaker, in Haydon Yard, in the Minories, carelessly left a<br>
direction for me in her own window; however, she is a good woman, for<br>
she released me out of a jail in which, I believe, that base wretch&quot;<br>
(pointing to Amy, who was coming to herself) &quot;caused me to be confined.&quot;<br>
As soon as Amy recovered, she flew at her like a devil, and between them<br>
there was so much noise as alarmed the servants, who all came to see<br>
what was the matter. Amy had pulled down one of my husband's swords,<br>
drawn it, and was just going to run her through the body, as the<br>
servants came in, who not knowing anything of the matter, some of them<br>
secured Amy, others held the girl, and the rest were busy about me, to<br>
prevent my fainting away, which was more than they could do, for I fell<br>
into strong fits, and in the interim they turned the girl out of the<br>
house, who was fully bent on revenge.<br>
<br>
My lord, as I now called him, was gone out a-hunting. I was satisfied he<br>
knew nothing of it, as yet, and when Amy and I were thoroughly come to<br>
ourselves, we thought it most advisable to find the girl out, and give<br>
her a handsome sum of money to keep her quiet. So Amy went out, but in<br>
all her searching could hear nothing of her; this made me very uneasy. I<br>
guessed she would contrive to see my lord before he came home, and so it<br>
proved, as you shall presently hear.<br>
<br>
When night came on, that I expected his return, I wondered I did not see<br>
him. Amy sat up in my chamber with me, and was as much concerned as was<br>
possible. Well, he did not come in all that night, but the next morning,<br>
about ten o'clock, he rapped at the door, with the girl along with him.<br>
When it was opened, he went into the great parlour, and bid Thomas go<br>
call down his lady. This was the crisis. I now summoned up all my<br>
resolution, and took Amy down with me, to see if we could not baffle the<br>
girl, who, to an inch, was her mother's own child.<br>
<br>
It will be necessary here to give a short account of our debate, because<br>
on it all my future misery depended, and it made me lose my husband's<br>
love, and own my daughter; who would not rest there, but told my lord<br>
how many brothers and sisters she had.<br>
<br>
When we entered the room, my lord was walking very gravely about it, but<br>
with his brows knit, and a wild confusion in his face, as if all the<br>
malice and revenge of a Dutchman had joined to put me out of countenance<br>
before I spoke a word.<br>
<br>
&quot;Pray, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;do you know this young woman? I expect a speedy<br>
and positive answer, without the least equivocation.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Really, my lord,&quot; replied I, &quot;to give you an answer as quick as you<br>
desire, I declare I do not.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Do not!&quot; said he, &quot;what do you mean by that? She tells me that you are<br>
her mother, and that her father ran away from you, and left two sons,<br>
and two daughters besides herself, who were all sent to their relations<br>
for provision, after which you ran away with a jeweller to Paris. Do you<br>
know anything of this? answer me quickly.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said the girl, &quot;there is Mrs. Amy, who was my mother's<br>
servant at the time (as she told me herself about three months ago),<br>
knows very well I am the person I pretend to be, and caused me to be<br>
thrown into jail for debts I knew nothing of, because I should not find<br>
out my mother to make myself known to her before she left England.&quot;<br>
<br>
After this she told my lord everything she knew of me, even in the<br>
character of Roxana, and described my dress so well, that he knew it to<br>
be mine.<br>
<br>
[Illustration: ROXANA IS CONFRONTED WITH HER DAUGHTER<br>
<br>
&quot;_Pray, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;do you know this young woman?_&quot;]<br>
<br>
When she had quite gone through her long relation, &quot;Well, madam,&quot;<br>
says he, &quot;now let me see if I cannot tell how far she has told the truth<br>
in relation to you. When I first became acquainted with you, it was on<br>
the sale of those jewels, in which I stood so much your friend, at a<br>
time that you were in the greatest distress, your substance being in the<br>
hands of the Jew; you then passed for a jeweller's widow; this agrees<br>
with her saying you ran away with a jeweller. In the next place, you<br>
would not consent to marry me about twelve years ago; I suppose then<br>
your real husband was living, for nothing else could tally with your<br>
condescension to me in everything except marriage. Since that time, your<br>
refusing to come to Holland in the vessel I had provided for you, under<br>
a distant prospect of your being with child, though in reality it was<br>
your having a child too much, as the captain told me of, when I, being<br>
ignorant of the case, did not understand him. Now,&quot; continued he, &quot;she<br>
says that you are the identical Lady Roxana which made so much noise in<br>
the world, and has even described the robe and head-dress you wore on<br>
that occasion, and in that I know she is right; for, to my own<br>
knowledge, you have that very dress by you now; I having seen you<br>
dressed in it at our lodging at the Quaker's. From all these<br>
circumstances,&quot; says he, &quot;I may be assured that you have imposed grossly<br>
upon me, and instead of being a woman of honour as I took you for, I<br>
find that you have been an abandoned wretch, and had nothing to<br>
recommend you but a sum of money and a fair countenance, joined to a<br>
false unrelenting heart.&quot;<br>
<br>
These words of my lord's struck such a damp upon my spirits, as made me<br>
unable to speak in my turn. But at last, I spoke as follows: &quot;My lord, I<br>
have most patiently stood to hear all it was possible for you to allege<br>
against me, which has no other proof than imagination. That I was the<br>
wife of a brewer, I have no reason now to deny, neither had I any<br>
occasion before to acknowledge it. I brought him a handsome fortune,<br>
which, joined to his, made us appear in a light far superior to our<br>
neighbours. I had also five children by him, two sons and three<br>
daughters, and had my husband been as wise as rich, we might have lived<br>
happily together now. But it was not so, for he minded nothing but<br>
sporting, in almost every branch; and closely following of it soon run<br>
out all his substance, and then left me in an unhappy, helpless<br>
condition. I did not send my children to my relations till the greatest<br>
necessity drove me, and after that, hearing my husband was dead, I<br>
married the jeweller, who was afterwards murdered. If I had owned how<br>
many children I had, the jeweller would not have married me, and the way<br>
of life I was in would not keep my family, so I was forced to deny them<br>
in order to get them bread. Neither can I say that I have either heard<br>
or known anything of my children since, excepting that I heard they were<br>
all taken care of; and this was the very reason I would not marry you,<br>
when you offered it some years since, for these children lay seriously<br>
at my heart, and as I did not want money, my inclination was to come to<br>
England, and not entail five children upon you the day of marriage.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pray, madam,&quot; said my lord, interrupting me, &quot;I do not find that you<br>
kept up to your resolutions when you got there; you were so far from<br>
doing your duty as a parent, that you even neglected the civility of<br>
acquaintances, for they would have asked after them, but your whole<br>
scheme has been to conceal yourself as much as possible, and even when<br>
you were found out, denied yourself, as witness the case of your<br>
daughter here. As to the character of Lady Roxana, which you so nicely<br>
managed,&quot; said he, &quot;did that become a woman that had five children,<br>
whose necessity had obliged you to leave them, to live in a continual<br>
scene of pageantry and riot, I could almost say debauchery? Look into<br>
your conduct, and see if you deserve to have the title or the estate you<br>
now so happily enjoy.&quot;<br>
<br>
After this speech, he walked about the room in a confused manner for<br>
some minutes, and then addressed himself to Amy. &quot;Pray, Mrs. Amy,&quot; says<br>
he, &quot;give me your judgment in this case, for although I know you are as<br>
much as possible in your lady's interest, yet I cannot think you have so<br>
little charity as to think she acted like a woman of worth and<br>
discretion. Do you really think, as you knew all of them from infants,<br>
that this young woman is your lady's daughter?&quot;<br>
<br>
Amy, who always had spirits enough about her, said at once she believed<br>
the girl was my daughter. &quot;And truly,&quot; says she, &quot;I think your man<br>
Thomas is her eldest son, for the tale he tells of his birth and<br>
education suits exactly with our then circumstances.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Why, indeed,&quot; said my lord, &quot;I believe so too, for I now recollect that<br>
when we first took him into our service at Dover, he told me he was the<br>
son of a brewer in London; that his father had run away from his mother,<br>
and left her in a distressed condition with five children, of which he<br>
was second child, or eldest son.&quot;<br>
<br>
Thomas was then called into the parlour, and asked what he knew of his<br>
family; he repeated all as above, concerning his father's running away<br>
and leaving me; but said that he had often asked and inquired after<br>
them, but without any success, and concluded, that he believed his<br>
brothers and sisters were distributed in several places, and that his<br>
mother died in the greatest distress, and was buried by the parish.<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed,&quot; said my lord, &quot;it is my opinion that Thomas is one of your<br>
sons; do not you think the same?&quot; addressing himself to me.<br>
<br>
&quot;From the circumstances that have been related, my lord,&quot; said I, &quot;I now<br>
believe that these are both my children; but you would have thought me a<br>
mad woman to have countenanced and taken this young woman in as my<br>
child, without a thorough assurance of it; for that would have been<br>
running myself to a certain expense and trouble, without the least<br>
glimpse of real satisfaction.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pray,&quot; said my lord to my daughter, &quot;let me know what is become of<br>
your brothers and sisters; give me the best account of them that you<br>
can.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord,&quot; replied she, &quot;agreeably to your commands, I will inform you<br>
to the best of my knowledge; and to begin with myself, who am the eldest<br>
of the five. I was put to a sister of my father's with my youngest<br>
brother, who, by mere dint of industry, gave us maintenance and<br>
education, suitable to her circumstances; and she, with my uncle's<br>
consent, let me go to service when I was advanced in years; and among<br>
the variety of places I lived at, Lady Roxana's was one.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Thomas, &quot;I knew her there, when I was a valet at my Lord<br>
D----'s, the next door; it was there I became acquainted with her; and<br>
she, by the consent of the gentlewoman,&quot; pointing to Amy, &quot;let me see<br>
the Lady Roxana's fine vestment, which she danced in at the grand ball.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; continued my daughter, &quot;after I left this place, I was at<br>
several others before I became acquainted with Mrs. Amy a second time (I<br>
knew her before as Roxana's woman), who told me one day some things<br>
relating to my mother, and from thence I concluded if she was not my<br>
mother herself (as I at first thought she was), she must be employed by<br>
her; for no stranger could profess so much friendship, where there was<br>
no likelihood of any return, after being so many years asunder.<br>
<br>
&quot;After this, I made it my business to find your lady out if possible,<br>
and was twice in her company, once on board the ship you were to have<br>
come to Holland in, and once at the Quaker's house in the Minories,<br>
London; but as I gave her broad hints of whom I took her for, and my<br>
lady did not think proper to own me, I began to think I was mistaken,<br>
till your voyage to Holland was put off. Soon after, I was flung into<br>
Whitechapel jail for a false debt, but, through the recommendation of<br>
the jailer's wife to the annual charity of the good Lady Roberts, of<br>
Mile End, I was discharged. Whereupon I posted away, seeking my mother<br>
all down the Kent Road as far as Dover and Deal, at which last place not<br>
finding her, I came in a coaster to London, and landing in Southwark,<br>
was immediately arrested, and confined in the Marshalsea prison, where I<br>
remained some time, deprived of every means to let any person without<br>
the prison know my deplorable state and condition, till my chum, a young<br>
woman, my bedfellow, who was also confined for debt, was, by a<br>
gentleman, discharged. This young woman of her own free will, went, my<br>
lord, to your lodgings in the Minories, and acquainted your landlady,<br>
the Quaker, where I was, and for what sum I was confined, who<br>
immediately sent and paid the pretended debt, and so I was a second time<br>
discharged. Upon which, going to the Quaker's to return her my thanks<br>
soon after a letter from your lady to her, with a direction in it where<br>
to find you, falling into my hands, I set out the next morning for the<br>
Hague; and I humbly hope your pardon, my lord, for the liberty I have<br>
taken; and you may be assured, that whatever circumstances of life I<br>
happen to be in, I will be no disgrace to your lordship or family.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well,&quot; said my husband, &quot;what can you say of your mother's second<br>
child, who, I hear, was a son?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said I, &quot;it is in my power to tell you, that Thomas there is<br>
the son you mention; their circumstances are the same, with this<br>
difference, that she was brought up under the care of a good aunt, and<br>
the boy forced to run away from a bad one, and shift for his bread ever<br>
since; so if she is my daughter, he is my son, and to oblige you, my<br>
lord, I own her, and to please myself I will own him, and they two are<br>
brother and sister.&quot; I had no sooner done speaking, than Thomas fell<br>
down before me, and asked my blessing, after which, he addressed himself<br>
to my lord as follows:<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said he, &quot;out of your abundant goodness you took me into your<br>
service at Dover. I told you then the circumstances I was in, which will<br>
save your lordship much time by preventing a repetition; but, if your<br>
lordship pleases, it shall be carefully penned down, for such a variety<br>
of incidents has happened to me in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland,<br>
Holland, France, and the Isle of Man, in which I have travelled for<br>
about eighteen years past, as may prove an agreeable amusement to you,<br>
when you are cloyed with better company; for as I have never been<br>
anything above a common servant, so my stories shall only consist of<br>
facts, and such as are seldom to be met with, as they are all in low<br>
life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, Thomas,&quot; said my lord, &quot;take your own time to do it, and I will<br>
reward you for your trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, madam,&quot; said my lord to my daughter, &quot;if you please to proceed.&quot;<br>
&quot;My lord,&quot; continued she, &quot;my mother's third child, which was a<br>
daughter, lived with the relation I did, and got a place to wait upon a<br>
young lady whose father and mother were going to settle at Boulogne, in<br>
France; she went with them, and having stayed at this gentleman's (who<br>
was a French merchant) two years, was married to a man with the consent<br>
of the family she lived in; and her master, by way of fortune, got him<br>
to be master of a French and Holland coaster, and this was the very<br>
person whose ship you hired to come to Holland in; the captain's wife<br>
was my own sister, consequently my lady's second daughter; as to my<br>
youngest sister, she lived with the uncle and aunt Thomas ran away from,<br>
and died of the smallpox soon after. My youngest brother was put out<br>
apprentice to a carpenter, where he improved in his business, till a<br>
gentlewoman came to his master and mistress (which I take by the<br>
description they gave me, to be Mrs. Amy), who had him put out to an<br>
education fit for a merchant, and then sent him to the Indies, where he<br>
is now settled, and in a fair way to get a large estate. This, my lord,<br>
is the whole account I can at present give of them, and although it may<br>
seem very strange, I assure you, it is all the just truth.&quot;<br>
<br>
When she had finished her discourse, my lord turned to me, and said,<br>
that since I that was her mother had neglected doing my duty, though<br>
sought so much after, he would take it upon himself to see both the girl<br>
and Thomas provided for, without any advising or letting me know<br>
anything about them; and added, with a malicious sneer, &quot;I must take<br>
care of the child I have had by you too, or it will have but an<br>
indifferent parent to trust to in case of my decease.&quot;<br>
<br>
This finished the discourse, and my lord withdrew into his study, in a<br>
humour that I am unable to describe, and left me, Amy, Thomas, and my<br>
daughter Susanna, as I must now call her, in the parlour together. We<br>
sat staring at each other some time, till at last Amy said, &quot;I suppose,<br>
my lady, you have no farther business with your new daughter; she has<br>
told her story, and may now dispose of herself to the best advantage she<br>
can.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said I, &quot;I have nothing to say to her, only that she shall<br>
never be admitted into my presence again.&quot; The poor girl burst out into<br>
tears, and said, &quot;Pray, my lady, excuse me, for I am certain that were<br>
you in my circumstances, you would have done the very action I have, and<br>
would expect a pardon for committing the offence.&quot;<br>
<br>
After this, I said to Thomas, &quot;Keep what has been said to yourself, and<br>
I shall speak to you by-and-by;&quot; and then I withdrew, and went upstairs<br>
to my closet, leaving Amy with Susanna, who soon dismissed her, and<br>
followed me.<br>
<br>
When Amy came to me, &quot;Now, my lady,&quot; says she, &quot;what do you think of<br>
this morning's work? I believe my lord is not so angry as we were<br>
fearful of.&quot; &quot;You are mistaken in your lord, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;and are not<br>
so well acquainted with the deep and premeditated revenge of Dutchmen as<br>
I am, and although it may not be my husband's temper, yet I dread it as<br>
much, but shall see more at dinner time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Soon after this, my husband called Thomas, and bid him order the cloth<br>
for his dinner to be laid in his study, and bid him tell his mother that<br>
he would dine by himself. When I heard this, I was more shocked than I<br>
had been yet. &quot;Now his anger begins to work, Amy,&quot; said I, &quot;how must I<br>
act?&quot; &quot;I do not know,&quot; answered she, &quot;but I will go into the study, and<br>
try what can be done, and, as a faithful mediator, will try to bring you<br>
together.&quot; She was not long before she returned, and bursting into<br>
tears, &quot;I know not what to do,&quot; says she, &quot;for your husband is in a deep<br>
study, and when I told him you desired him to dine with you in the<br>
parlour as usual, he only said, 'Mrs. Amy, go to your lady, tell her to<br>
dine when and where she pleases, and pray obey her as your lady; but let<br>
her know from me that she has lost the tenderness I had for her as a<br>
wife, by the little thought she had of her children.'&quot;<br>
<br>
Nothing could have shocked me more than the delivery of this message by<br>
Amy. I, almost bathed in tears, went to him myself; found him in a<br>
melancholy posture reading in Milton's &quot;Paradise Regained.&quot; He looked at<br>
me very sternly when I entered his study, told me he had nothing to say<br>
to me at that time, and if I had a mind not to disturb him, I must leave<br>
him for the present. &quot;My lord,&quot; said I, &quot;supposing all that has been<br>
said by this girl was truth, what reason have you to be in this<br>
unforgiving humour? What have I done to you to deserve this usage? Have<br>
you found any fault with me since I had the happiness of being married<br>
to you? Did you ever find me in any company that you did not approve of?<br>
Have you any reason to think that I have wasted any of your substance?<br>
If you have none of these things to allege against me, for heaven's sake<br>
do not let us now make our lives unhappy, for my having had legitimate<br>
children by a lawful husband, at a time that you think it no crime to<br>
have had a natural son by me, which I had the most reason to repent of.&quot;<br>
<br>
I spoke the latter part of these words with a small air of authority,<br>
that he might think me the less guilty; but, I believe, he only looked<br>
on what I had said as a piece of heroism; for he soon after delivered<br>
himself in the following speech: &quot;Madam, do you not think that you have<br>
used me in a very deceitful manner? If you think that I have not had<br>
that usage, I will, in a few words, prove the contrary. When first I<br>
knew you, soon after the jeweller's death at Paris, you never mentioned,<br>
in all that intricate affair I was engaged in for you, so much as your<br>
having any children; that, as your circumstances then were, could have<br>
done you no harm, but, on the contrary, it would have moved the<br>
compassion of your bitter enemy the Jew, if he had any. Afterwards, when<br>
I first saw you in London, and began to treat with you about marriage,<br>
your children, which, to all prudent women, are the first things<br>
provided for, were so far neglected as not to be spoken of, though mine<br>
were mentioned to you; and as our fortunes were very considerable, yours<br>
might very well have been put into the opposite scale with them. Another<br>
great piece of your injustice was when I offered to settle your own<br>
fortune upon yourself, you would not consent to it; I do not look on<br>
that piece of condescension out of love to me, but a thorough hatred you<br>
had to your own flesh and blood; and lastly, your not owning your<br>
daughter, though she strongly hinted who she was to you when she was<br>
twice in your company, and even followed you from place to place while<br>
you were in England. Now, if you can reconcile this piece of inhumanity<br>
with yourself, pray try what you can say to me about your never telling<br>
me the life you led in Pall Mall, in the character of Roxana? You<br>
scrupled to be happily married to me, and soon after came to England,<br>
and was a reputed whore to any nobleman that would come up to your<br>
price, and lived with one a considerable time, and was taken by several<br>
people to be his lawful wife. If any gentleman should ask me what I have<br>
taken to my bed, what must I answer? I must say an inhuman false-hearted<br>
whore, one that had not tenderness enough to own her own children, and<br>
has too little virtue, in my mind, to make a good wife.<br>
<br>
&quot;I own I would,&quot; says he, &quot;have settled your own estate upon you with<br>
great satisfaction, but I will not do it now; you may retire to your<br>
chamber, and when I have any occasion to speak with you, I will send a<br>
messenger to you; so, my undeserving lady countess, you may walk out of<br>
the room.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was going to reply to all this, but instead of hearing me, he began to<br>
speak against the Quaker, who, he supposed, knew all the intrigues of my<br>
life; but I cleared her innocence, by solemnly declaring it was a<br>
thorough reformation of my past life that carried me to live at the<br>
Quaker's house, who knew nothing of me before I went to live with her,<br>
and that she was, I believed, a virtuous woman.<br>
<br>
I went away prodigiously chagrined. I knew not what course to take; I<br>
found expostulation signified nothing, and all my hopes depended on what<br>
I might say to him after we were gone to bed at night. I sent in for<br>
Amy, and having told her our discourse, she said she knew not what to<br>
think of him, but hoped it would, by great submission, wear off by<br>
degrees. I could eat but little dinner, and Amy was more sorrowful than<br>
hungry, and after we had dined, we walked by ourselves in the garden,<br>
to know what we had best pursue. As we were walking about, Thomas came<br>
to us, and told us that the young woman who had caused all the words,<br>
had been at the door, and delivered a letter to my lord's footman, who<br>
had carried it upstairs, and that she was ordered to go to his lordship<br>
in his study, which struck me with a fresh and sensible grief. I told<br>
Thomas, as he was to be her brother, to learn what my lord had said to<br>
her, if he could, as she came down; on which he went into the house to<br>
obey his order.<br>
<br>
He was not gone in above a quarter of an hour before he came to me<br>
again, and told me she was gone, and that my lord had given her a purse<br>
of twenty guineas, with orders to live retired, let nobody know who or<br>
what she was, and come to him again in about a month's time. I was very<br>
much satisfied to hear this, and was in hopes of its proving a happy<br>
omen; and I was better pleased about two hours after, when Thomas came<br>
to me to let me know that my lord had given him thirty guineas, and bid<br>
him take off his livery, and new clothe himself, for he intended to make<br>
him his first clerk, and put him in the way of making his fortune. I now<br>
thought it was impossible for me to be poor, and was inwardly rejoiced<br>
that my children (meaning Thomas and Susanna) were in the high road to<br>
grow rich.<br>
<br>
As Amy and I had dined by ourselves, my lord kept his study all the day,<br>
and at night, after supper, Isabel came and told me that my lord's man<br>
had received orders to make his bed in the crimson room, which name it<br>
received from the colour of the bed and furniture, and was reserved<br>
against the coming of strangers, or sickness. When she had delivered her<br>
message she withdrew, and I told Amy it would be to no purpose to go to<br>
him again, but I would have her lie in a small bed, which I ordered<br>
immediately to be carried into my chamber. Before we went to bed, I went<br>
to his lordship to know why he would make us both look so little among<br>
our own servants, as to part, bed and board, so suddenly. He only said,<br>
&quot;My Lady Roxana knows the airs of quality too well to be informed that a<br>
scandal among nobility does not consist in parting of beds; if you<br>
cannot lie by yourself, you may send a letter to my Lord ----, whom you<br>
lived with as a mistress in London; perhaps he may want a bedfellow as<br>
well as you, and come to you at once; you are too well acquainted with<br>
him to stand upon ceremony.&quot;<br>
<br>
I left him, with my heart full of malice, grief, shame, and revenge. I<br>
did not want a good will to do any mischief; but I wanted an unlimited<br>
power to put all my wicked thoughts in execution.<br>
<br>
Amy and I lay in our chamber, and the next morning at breakfast we were<br>
talking of what the servants (for there were thirteen of them in all,<br>
viz., two coachmen, four footmen, a groom, and postillion, two women<br>
cooks, two housemaids, and a laundry-maid, besides Isabel, who was my<br>
waiting-maid, and Amy, who acted as housekeeper) could say of the<br>
disturbance that was in the family. &quot;Pho!&quot; said Amy, &quot;never trouble your<br>
head about that, for family quarrels are so common in noblemen's houses,<br>
both here and in England, that there are more families parted, both in<br>
bed and board, than live lovingly together. It can be no surprise to the<br>
servants, and if your neighbours should hear it, they will only think<br>
you are imitating the air of nobility, and have more of that blood in<br>
you than you appeared to have when you and your lord lived happily<br>
together.&quot;<br>
<br>
The time, I own, went very sluggishly on. I had no company but Amy and<br>
Isabel, and it was given out among the servants of noblemen and gentry<br>
that I was very much indisposed, for I thought it a very improper time<br>
either to receive or pay visits.<br>
<br>
In this manner I lived till the month was up that my daughter was to<br>
come again to my lord, for although I went morning, noon, and night,<br>
into his apartment to see him, I seldom had a quarter of an hour's<br>
discourse with him, and oftentimes one of his valets would be sent to<br>
tell me his lord was busy, a little before the time I usually went,<br>
which I found was to prevent my going in to him, but this was only when<br>
he was in an ill humour, as his man called it.<br>
<br>
Whether my lord used to make himself uneasy for want of mine or other<br>
company, I cannot tell, but the servants complained every day, as I<br>
heard by Amy, that his lordship ate little or nothing, and would<br>
sometimes shed tears when he sat down by himself to breakfast, dinner,<br>
or supper; and, indeed, I began to think that he looked very thin, his<br>
countenance grew pale, and that he had every other sign of a grieved or<br>
broken heart.<br>
<br>
My daughter came to him one Monday morning, and stayed with him in his<br>
study near two hours. I wondered at the reason of it, but could guess at<br>
nothing certain; and at last she went away, but I fixed myself so as to<br>
see her as she passed by me, and she appeared to have a countenance full<br>
of satisfaction.<br>
<br>
In the evening, when I went in as usual, he spoke to me in a freer style<br>
than he had done since our breach. &quot;Well, madam&quot; (for he had not used<br>
the words &quot;my lady&quot; at any time after my daughter's coming to our<br>
house), said he, &quot;I think I have provided for your daughter.&quot; &quot;As how,<br>
my lord, pray will you let me know?&quot; said I. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied he, &quot;as I<br>
have reason to think you will be sorry to hear of her welfare in any<br>
shape, I will tell you. A gentleman who is going factor for the Dutch<br>
East India Company, on the coast of Malabar, I have recommended her to;<br>
and he, on my character and promise of a good fortune, will marry her<br>
very soon, for the Company's ships sail in about twelve days; so, in a<br>
fortnight, like a great many mothers as there are nowadays, you may<br>
rejoice at having got rid of one of your children, though you neither<br>
know where, how, or to whom.&quot;<br>
<br>
Although I was very glad my lord spoke to me at all, and more especially<br>
so at my daughter's going to be married, and settling in the Indies, yet<br>
his words left so sharp a sting behind them as was exceeding troublesome<br>
to me to wear off. I did not dare venture to make any further inquiries,<br>
but was very glad of what I heard, and soon bidding my lord goodnight,<br>
went and found Amy, who was reading a play in the chamber.<br>
<br>
I waited with the greatest impatience for this marriage; and when I<br>
found the day was fixed, I made bold to ask my lord if I should not be<br>
present in his chamber when the ceremony was performed. This favor was<br>
also denied me. I then asked my lord's chaplain to speak to him on that<br>
head, but he was deaf to his importunities, and bade him tell me that I<br>
very well knew his mind. The wedding was performed on a Wednesday<br>
evening, in my lord's presence, and he permitted nobody to be there but<br>
a sister of the bridegroom's, and Thomas (now my lord's secretary or<br>
chief clerk), who was brother to the bride, and who gave her away. They<br>
all supped together after the ceremony was over in the great<br>
dining-room, where the fortune was paid, which was &pound;2000 (as I heard<br>
from Thomas afterwards), and the bonds for the performance of the<br>
marriage were redelivered.<br>
<br>
Next morning my lord asked me if I was willing to see my daughter before<br>
she sailed to the Indies. &quot;My lord,&quot; said I, &quot;as the seeing of her was<br>
the occasion of this great breach that has happened between us, so if<br>
your lordship will let me have a sight of her and a reconciliation with<br>
you at the same time, there is nothing can be more desirable to me, or<br>
would more contribute to my happiness during the rest of my life.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No, madam,&quot; says he, &quot;I would have you see your daughter, to be<br>
reconciled to her, and give her your blessing (if a blessing can proceed<br>
from you) at parting; but our reconciliation will never be completed<br>
till one of us comes near the verge of life, if then; for I am a man<br>
that am never reconciled without ample amends, which is a thing that is<br>
not in your power to give, without you can alter the course of nature<br>
and recall time.&quot;<br>
<br>
On hearing him declare himself so open, I told him that my curse instead<br>
of my blessing would pursue my daughter for being the author of all the<br>
mischiefs that had happened between us. &quot;No, madam,&quot; said he, &quot;if you<br>
had looked upon her as a daughter heretofore, I should have had no<br>
occasion to have had any breach with you. The whole fault lies at your<br>
own door; for whatever your griefs may inwardly be, I would have you<br>
recollect they were of your own choosing.&quot;<br>
<br>
I found I was going to give way to a very violent passion, which would<br>
perhaps be the worse for me, so I left the room and went up to my own<br>
chamber, not without venting bitter reproaches both against my daughter<br>
and her unknown husband.<br>
<br>
However, the day she was to go on shipboard, she breakfasted with my<br>
lord, and as soon as it was over, and my lord was gone into his study to<br>
fetch something out, I followed him there, and asked him if he would<br>
give me leave to present a gold repeating watch to my daughter before<br>
she went away. I thought he seemed somewhat pleased with this piece of<br>
condescension in me, though it was done more to gain his goodwill than<br>
to express any value I had for her. He told me that he did not know who<br>
I could better make such a present to, and I might give it to her if I<br>
pleased. Accordingly I went and got it out of my cabinet in a moment,<br>
and bringing it to my lord, desired he would give it her from me. He<br>
asked me if I would not give it her myself. I told him no; I wished her<br>
very well, but had nothing to say to her till I was restored to his<br>
lordship's bed and board.<br>
<br>
About two hours after all this, the coach was ordered to the door, and<br>
my daughter and her new husband, the husband's sister, and my son<br>
Thomas, all went into it, in order to go to the house of a rich uncle of<br>
the bridegroom's, where they were to dine before they went on board, and<br>
my lord went there in a sedan about an hour after. And having eaten<br>
their dinner, which on this occasion was the most elegant, they all went<br>
on board the Indiaman, where my lord and my son Thomas stayed till the<br>
ship's crew was hauling in their anchors to sail, and then came home<br>
together in the coach, and it being late in the evening, he told Thomas<br>
he should sup with him that night, after which they went to bed in<br>
their several apartments.<br>
<br>
Next morning when I went to see my lord as usual, he told me that as he<br>
had handsomely provided for my daughter, and sent her to the Indies with<br>
a man of merit and fortune, he sincerely wished her great prosperity.<br>
&quot;And,&quot; he added, &quot;to let you see, madam, that I should never have parted<br>
from my first engagements of love to you, had you not laid yourself so<br>
open to censure for your misconduct, my next care shall be to provide<br>
for your son Thomas in a handsome manner, before I concern myself with<br>
my son by you.&quot;<br>
<br>
This was the subject of our discourse, with which I was very well<br>
pleased. I only wished my daughter had been married and sent to the<br>
Indies before I had married myself; but I began to hope that the worst<br>
would be over when Thomas was provided for too, and the son my lord had<br>
by me, who was now at the university, was at home; which I would have<br>
brought to pass could my will be obeyed, but I was not to enjoy that<br>
happiness.<br>
<br>
My lord and I lived with a secret discontent of each other for near a<br>
twelvemonth before I saw any provision made for my son Thomas, and then<br>
I found my lord bought him a very large plantation in Virginia, and was<br>
furnishing him to go there in a handsome manner; he also gave him four<br>
quarter parts in four large trading West India vessels, in which he<br>
boarded a great quantity of merchandise to traffic with when he came to<br>
the end of his journey, so that he was a very rich man before he (what<br>
we call) came into the world.<br>
<br>
The last article that was to be managed, was to engage my son to a wife<br>
before he left Holland; and it happened that the gentleman who was the<br>
seller of the plantation my husband bought, had been a Virginia planter<br>
in that colony a great many years; but his life growing on the decline,<br>
and his health very dubious, he had come to Holland with an intent to<br>
sell his plantation, and then had resolved to send for his wife, son,<br>
and daughter, to come to him with the return of the next ships. This<br>
gentleman had brought over with him the pictures of all his family,<br>
which he was showing to my lord at the same time he was paying for the<br>
effects; and on seeing the daughter's picture, which appeared to him<br>
very beautiful, my lord inquired if she was married. &quot;No, my lord,&quot; says<br>
the planter, &quot;but I believe I shall dispose of her soon after she comes<br>
to me.&quot; &quot;How old is your daughter?&quot; said my lord. &quot;Why, my lord,&quot;<br>
replied the planter, &quot;she is twenty-two years of age.&quot; Then my lord<br>
asked my son if he should like that young lady for a wife. &quot;Nothing, my<br>
lord,&quot; said Thomas, &quot;could lay a greater obligation upon me than your<br>
lordship's providing me with a wife.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now, sir,&quot; said my lord to the planter, &quot;what do you say to a match<br>
between this young gentleman and your daughter? Their ages are<br>
agreeable, and if you can, or will, give her more fortune than he has,<br>
his shall be augmented. You partly know his substance, by the money I<br>
have now paid you.&quot;<br>
<br>
This generous proposal of my lord's pleased the planter to a great<br>
degree, and he declared to my lord that he thought nothing could be a<br>
greater favour done him, for two reasons; one of which was, that he was<br>
certain the young gentleman was as good as he appeared, because he had<br>
taken for his plantation so large a sum of money as none but a gentleman<br>
could pay. The next reason was, that this marriage, to be performed as<br>
soon as my son arrived there, would be a great satisfaction to his wife,<br>
whose favourite the daughter was. &quot;For,&quot; added he, &quot;my wife will not<br>
only have the pleasure of seeing her daughter settled on what was our<br>
own hereditary estate, but also see her married to a man of substance,<br>
without the danger of crossing the seas to be matched to a person equal<br>
to herself.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Pray, sir,&quot; said my lord, &quot;let me hear what fortune you are willing to<br>
give with your daughter; you have but two children, and I know you must<br>
be rich.&quot; &quot;Why, my lord,&quot; replied the planter, &quot;there is no denying<br>
that; but you must remember I have a son as well as a daughter to<br>
provide for, and he I intend to turn into the mercantile way as soon as<br>
he arrives safe from Virginia. I have, my lord,&quot; continued he, &quot;a very<br>
large stock-in-trade there, as warehouses of tobacco, &amp;c., lodged in the<br>
custom-houses of the ports, to the value of &pound;7000, to which I will add<br>
&pound;3000 in money, and I hope you will look upon that as a very competent<br>
estate; and when the young gentleman's fortune is joined to that, I<br>
believe he will be the richest man in the whole American colonies of his<br>
age.&quot;<br>
<br>
It was then considered between my lord and Thomas, that no woman with a<br>
quarter of that fortune would venture herself over to the West Indies<br>
with a man that had ten times as much; so it being hinted to the planter<br>
that my lord had agreed to the proposals, they promised to meet the next<br>
morning to settle the affair.<br>
<br>
In the evening, my lord, with Thomas in his company, hinted the above<br>
discourse to me. I was frightened almost out of my wits to think what a<br>
large sum of money had been laid out for my son, but kept what I thought<br>
to myself. It was agreed that my son was to marry the old planter's<br>
daughter, and a lawyer was sent for, with instructions to draw up all<br>
the writings for the marriage-settlement, &amp;c., and the next morning a<br>
messenger came from the planter with a note to my lord, letting him<br>
know, if it was not inconvenient, he would wait on his lordship to<br>
breakfast. He came soon after with a Dutch merchant of great estate, who<br>
was our neighbour at The Hague, where they settled every point in<br>
question, and the articles were all drawn up and signed by the several<br>
parties the next day before dinner.<br>
<br>
There was nothing now remaining but my son's departure to his new<br>
plantation in Virginia. Great despatch was made that he might be ready<br>
to sail in one of his own ships, and take the advantage of an English<br>
convoy, which was almost ready to sail. My lord sent several valuable<br>
presents to my son's lady, as did her father; and as I was at liberty in<br>
this case to do as I would, and knowing my lord had a very great value<br>
for my son, I thought that the richer my presents were, the more he<br>
would esteem me (but there was nothing in it, the enmity he took against<br>
me had taken root in his heart); so I sent her a curious set of china,<br>
the very best I could buy, with a silver tea-kettle and lamp, tea-pot,<br>
sugar-dish, cream-pot, teaspoons, &amp;c., and as my lord had sent a golden<br>
repeater, I added to it a golden equipage, with my lord's picture<br>
hanging to it, finely painted; (This was another thing I did purposely<br>
to please him, but it would not do.) A few days after, he came to take<br>
his leave of me, by my lord's order, and at my parting with him I shed<br>
abundance of tears, to think I was then in an almost strange place, no<br>
child that could then come near me, and under so severe a displeasure of<br>
my lord, that I had very little hopes of ever being friends with him<br>
again.<br>
<br>
My life did not mend after my son was gone; all I could do would not<br>
persuade my lord to have any free conversation with me. And at this<br>
juncture it was that the foolish jade Amy, who was now advanced in<br>
years, was catched in a conversation with one of my lord's men, which<br>
was not to her credit; for, it coming to his ears, she was turned out of<br>
the house by my lord's orders, and was never suffered to come into it<br>
again during his lifetime, and I did not dare to speak a word in her<br>
favour for fear he should retort upon me, &quot;Like mistress, like maid.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could hear nothing of Amy for the first three months after she had<br>
left me, till one day, as I was looking out of a dining-room window, I<br>
saw her pass by, but I did not dare ask her to come in, for fear my lord<br>
should hear of her being there, which would have been adding fuel to the<br>
fire; however, she, looking up at the house, saw me. I made a motion to<br>
her to stay a little about the door, and in the meantime I wrote a note,<br>
and dropped it out of the window, in which I told her how I had lived in<br>
her absence, and desired her to write me a letter, and carry it the next<br>
day to my sempstress's house, who would take care to deliver it to me<br>
herself.<br>
<br>
I told Isabel that she should let me know when the milliner came again,<br>
for I had some complaints to her about getting up my best suit of<br>
Brussels lace nightclothes. On the Saturday following, just after I had<br>
dined, Isabel came into my apartment. &quot;My lady,&quot; says she, &quot;the milliner<br>
is in the parlour; will you be pleased to have her sent upstairs, or<br>
will your ladyship be pleased to go down to her?&quot; &quot;Why, send her up,<br>
Isabel,&quot; said I, &quot;she is as able to come to me as I am to go to her; I<br>
will see her here.&quot;<br>
<br>
When the milliner came into my chamber, I sent Isabel to my<br>
dressing-room to fetch a small parcel of fine linen which lay there, and<br>
in the interim she gave me Amy's letter, which I put into my pocket,<br>
and, having pretended to be angry about my linen, I gave her the small<br>
bundle Isabel brought, and bid her be sure to do them better for the<br>
future.<br>
<br>
She promised me she would, and went about her business; and when she was<br>
gone, I opened Amy's letter, and having read it, found it was to the<br>
following purpose, viz., that she had opened a coffee-house, and<br>
furnished the upper part of it to let out in lodgings; that she kept two<br>
maids and a man, but that the trade of it did not answer as she had<br>
reason to expect; she was willing to leave it off, and retire into the<br>
country to settle for the rest of her life, but was continually harassed<br>
by such disturbance in her conscience as made her unfit to resolve upon<br>
anything, and wished there was a possibility for her to see me, that she<br>
might open her mind with the same freedom as formerly, and have my<br>
advice upon some particular affairs; and such-like discourse.<br>
<br>
It was a pretty while before I heard from Amy again, and when I did, the<br>
letter was in much the same strain as the former, excepting that things<br>
were coming more to a crisis; for she told me in it that her money was<br>
so out, that is, lent as ready money to traders, and trusted for liquors<br>
in her house, that if she did not go away this quarter, she should be<br>
obliged to run away the next. I very much lamented her unfortunate case,<br>
but that could be no assistance to her, as I had it not now in my power<br>
to see her when I would, or give her what I pleased, as it had always<br>
used to be; so all I could do was to wish her well, and leave her to<br>
take care of herself.<br>
<br>
About this time it was that I perceived my lord began to look very pale<br>
and meagre, and I had a notion he was going into a consumption, but did<br>
not dare tell him so, for fear he should say I was daily looking for his<br>
death, and was now overjoyed that I saw a shadow of it; nevertheless, he<br>
soon after began to find himself in a very bad state of health, for he<br>
said to me one morning, that my care would not last long, for he<br>
believed he was seized by a distemper it was impossible for him to get<br>
over. &quot;My lord,&quot; said I, &quot;you do not do me justice in imagining anything<br>
concerning me that does not tend to your own happiness, for if your body<br>
is out of order, my mind suffers for it.&quot; Indeed, had he died then,<br>
without making a will, it might have been well for me; but he was not so<br>
near death as that; and, what was worse, the distemper, which proved a<br>
consumption (which was occasioned chiefly by much study, watchings,<br>
melancholy thoughts, wilful and obstinate neglect of taking care of his<br>
body, and such like things), held him nine weeks and three days after<br>
this, before it carried him off.<br>
<br>
He now took country lodgings, most delightfully situated both for air<br>
and prospect, and had a maid and man to attend him. I begged on my knees<br>
to go with him, but could not get that favour granted; for, if I could,<br>
it might have been the means of restoring me to his favour, but our<br>
breach was too wide to be thoroughly reconciled, though I used all the<br>
endearing ways I had ever had occasion for to creep into his favour.<br>
<br>
Before he went out of town he locked and sealed up every room in the<br>
house, excepting my bedchamber, dressing-room, one parlour, and all the<br>
offices and rooms belonging to the servants; and, as he had now all my<br>
substance in his power, I was in a very poor state for a countess, and<br>
began to wish, with great sincerity, that I had never seen him, after I<br>
had lived so happy a life as I did at the Quaker's. For notwithstanding<br>
our estates joined together, when we were first married, amounted to<br>
&pound;3376 per annum, and near &pound;18,000 ready money, besides jewels, plate,<br>
goods, &amp;c., of a considerable value, yet we had lived in a very high<br>
manner since our taking the title of earl and countess upon us; setting<br>
up a great house, and had a number of servants; our equipage, such as<br>
coach, chariot, horses, and their attendants; a handsome fortune my lord<br>
had given to my daughter, and a very noble one to my son, whom he loved<br>
very well, not for his being my son, but for the courteous behaviour of<br>
him in never aspiring to anything above a valet after he knew who he<br>
was, till my lord made him his secretary or clerk. Besides all these<br>
expenses, my lord, having flung himself into the trade to the Indies,<br>
both East and West, had sustained many great and uncommon losses,<br>
occasioned by his merchandise being mostly shipped in English bottoms;<br>
and that nation having declared war against the crown of Spain, he was<br>
one of the first and greatest sufferers by that power; so that, on the<br>
whole, our estate, which was as above, dwindled to about &pound;1000 per<br>
annum, and our home stock, viz., about &pound;17,000, was entirely gone. This,<br>
I believe, was another great mortification to his lordship, and one of<br>
the main things that did help to hasten his end; for he was observed,<br>
both by me and all his servants, to be more cast down at hearing of his<br>
losses, that were almost daily sent to him, than he was at what had<br>
happened between him and me.<br>
<br>
Nothing could give more uneasiness than the damage our estate sustained<br>
by this traffic. He looked upon it as a mere misfortune that no person<br>
could avoid; but I, besides that, thought it was a judgment upon me, to<br>
punish me in the loss of all my ill-got gain. But when I found that his<br>
own fortune began to dwindle as well as mine, I was almost ready to<br>
think it was possible his lordship might have been as wicked a liver as<br>
I had, and the same vengeance as had been poured upon me for my repeated<br>
crimes might also be a punishment for him.<br>
<br>
As his lordship was in a bad state of health, and had removed to a<br>
country lodging, his study and counting-house, as well as his other<br>
rooms, were locked and sealed up; all business was laid aside, excepting<br>
such letters as came to him were carried to his lordship to be opened,<br>
read, and answered. I also went to see him morning and evening, but he<br>
would not suffer me to stay with him a single night. I might have had<br>
another room in the same house, but was not willing the people who kept<br>
it should know that there was a misunderstanding between us; so I<br>
contented myself to be a constant visitor, but could not persuade him to<br>
forgive me the denying of my daughter, and acting the part of Roxana,<br>
because I had kept those two things an inviolable secret from him and<br>
everybody else but Amy, and it was carelessness in her conduct at last<br>
that was the foundation of all my future misery.<br>
<br>
As my lord's weakness increased, so his ill temper, rather than<br>
diminish, increased also. I could do nothing to please him, and began to<br>
think that he was only pettish because he found it was his turn to go<br>
out of the world first. A gentleman that lived near him, as well as his<br>
chaplain, persuaded him to have a physician, to know in what state his<br>
health was; and by all I could learn, the doctor told him to settle his<br>
worldly affairs as soon as he conveniently could. &quot;For,&quot; says he,<br>
&quot;although your death is not certain, still your life is very<br>
precarious.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first thing he did after this was to send for the son he had by me<br>
from the university. He came the week afterwards, and the tutor with<br>
him, to take care of his pupil. The next day after my lord came home,<br>
and sending for six eminent men that lived at The Hague he made his<br>
will, and signed it in the presence of them all; and they, with the<br>
chaplain, were appointed the executors of it, and guardians of my son.<br>
<br>
As I was in a great concern at his making his will unknown to me, and<br>
before we were friends, I thought of it in too serious a manner not to<br>
speak about it. I did not know where to apply first, but after mature<br>
consideration sent for the chaplain, and he coming to me, I desired he<br>
would give me the best intelligence he could about it. &quot;My lady,&quot; said<br>
he, &quot;you cannot be so unacquainted with the duty of my function, and the<br>
trust my lord has reposed in me, but you must know I shall go beyond my<br>
trust in relating anything of that nature to you; all that I can say on<br>
that head is, that I would have you make friends with my lord as soon as<br>
you possibly can, and get him to make another will, or else take the<br>
best care of yourself as lies in your power; for, I assure you, if his<br>
lordship dies, you are but poorly provided for.&quot;<br>
<br>
These last words of the chaplain's most terribly alarmed me. I knew not<br>
what to do; and, at last, as if I was to be guided by nothing but the<br>
furies, I went to his chamber, and after inquiring how he did, and<br>
hearing that he was far from well, I told him I had heard he had made<br>
his will. &quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;I have; and what then?&quot; &quot;Why, my lord,&quot;<br>
replied I, &quot;I thought it would not have been derogatory to both our<br>
honours for you to have mentioned it to me before you did it, and have<br>
let me known in what manner you intended to settle your estate. This<br>
would have been but acting like a man to his wife, even if you had<br>
married me without a fortune; but as you received so handsomely with me,<br>
you ought to have considered it as my substance, as well as your own,<br>
that you were going to dispose of.&quot;<br>
<br>
My lord looked somewhat staggered at what I had said, and pausing a<br>
little while, answered, that he thought, and also looked upon it as a<br>
granted opinion, that after a man married a woman, all that she was in<br>
possession of was his, excepting he had made a prior writing or<br>
settlement to her of any part or all she was then possessed of.<br>
&quot;Besides, my lady,&quot; added he, &quot;I have married both your children, and<br>
given them very noble fortunes, especially your son. I have also had<br>
great losses in trade, both by sea and land, since you delivered your<br>
fortune to me, and even at this time, notwithstanding the appearance we<br>
make in the world, I am not worth a third of what I was when we came to<br>
settle in Holland; and then, here is our own son shall be provided for<br>
in a handsome manner by me; for I am thoroughly convinced there will be<br>
but little care taken of him if I leave anything in your power for that<br>
purpose: witness Thomas and Susanna.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;My lord,&quot; said I, &quot;I am not come into your chamber to know what care<br>
you have taken of our child. I do not doubt but you have acted like a<br>
father by it. What I would be informed in is, what I am to depend upon<br>
in case of your decease; which I, however, hope may be a great many<br>
years off yet.&quot; &quot;You need not concern yourself about that,&quot; said he;<br>
&quot;your son will take care that you shall not want; but yet, I will tell<br>
you, too,&quot; said he, &quot;that it may prevent your wishing for my death. I<br>
have, in my will, left all I am possessed of in the world to my son,<br>
excepting &pound;1500; out of that there is &pound;500 for you, &pound;500 among my<br>
executors, and the other &pound;500 is to bury me, pay my funeral expenses,<br>
and what is overplus I have ordered to be equally divided among my<br>
servants.&quot;<br>
<br>
When I had heard him pronounce these words, I stared like one that was<br>
frightened out of his senses. &quot;Five hundred pounds for me!&quot; says I;<br>
&quot;pray, what do you mean? What! am I, that brought you so handsome a<br>
fortune, to be under the curb of my son, and ask him for every penny I<br>
want? No, sir,&quot; said I, &quot;I will not accept it. I expect to be left in<br>
full possession of one-half of your fortune, that I may live the<br>
remainder of my life like your wife.&quot; &quot;Madam,&quot; replied my lord, &quot;you may<br>
expect what you please. If you can make it appear since I found you out<br>
to be a jilt that I have looked upon you as my wife, everything shall be<br>
altered and settled just as you desire, which might then be called your<br>
will; but as the case now stands, the will is mine, and so it shall<br>
remain.&quot;<br>
<br>
I thought I should have sunk when I had heard him make this solemn and<br>
premeditated declaration. I raved like a mad woman, and, at the end of<br>
my discourse, told him that I did not value what could happen to me,<br>
even if I was forced to beg my bread, for I would stand the test of my<br>
own character; and as I could get nothing by being an honest woman, so<br>
I should not scruple to declare that &quot;the son you have left what you<br>
have to is a bastard you had by me several years before we were<br>
married.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh,&quot; says he, &quot;madam, do you think you can frighten me? no, not in the<br>
least; for if you ever mention anything of it, the title, as well as all<br>
the estate, will go to another branch of my family, and you will then be<br>
left to starve in good earnest, without having the least glimpse of hope<br>
to better your fortune; for,&quot; added he, &quot;it is not very probable that<br>
you will be courted for a wife by any man of substance at these years;<br>
so if you have a mind to make yourself easy in your present<br>
circumstances, you must rest contented with what I have left you, and<br>
not prove yourself a whore to ruin your child, in whose power it will be<br>
to provide for you in a handsome manner, provided you behave yourself<br>
with that respect to him and me as you ought to do; for if any words<br>
arise about what I have done, I shall make a fresh will, and, as the<br>
laws of this nation will give me liberty, cut you off with a shilling.&quot;<br>
<br>
My own unhappiness, and his strong and lasting resentment, had kept me<br>
at high words, and flowing in tears, for some time; and as I was<br>
unwilling anybody should see me in that unhappy condition, I stayed<br>
coolly talking to him, till our son, who had been to several gentlemen's<br>
houses about my lord's business, came home to tell his father the<br>
success he had met with abroad. He brought in with him bank-notes to<br>
the amount of &pound;12,000, which he had received of some merchants he held a<br>
correspondence with; at which my lord was well pleased, for he was<br>
pretty near out of money at this juncture. After our son had delivered<br>
the accounts and bills, and had withdrawn, I asked my lord, in a calm<br>
tone, to give me the satisfaction of knowing in what manner the losses<br>
he had complained to have suffered consisted. &quot;You must consider, my<br>
lord,&quot; said I, &quot;that according to what you have been pleased to inform<br>
me of, we are upwards of &pound;2000 per annum, besides about &pound;17,000 ready<br>
money, poorer than we were when we first came to settle in Holland.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You talk,&quot; replied my lord, &quot;in a very odd manner. Do not you know that<br>
I had children of my own by a former wife? and of these I have taken so<br>
much care as to provide with very handsome fortunes, which are settled<br>
irrevocably upon them. I have, Providence be thanked, given each of them<br>
&pound;5000, and that is laid in East India stock, sufficient to keep them<br>
genteelly, above the frowns of fortune, and free from the fear of want.<br>
This, joined to the money I mentioned to you before, as losses at sea,<br>
deaths, and bankruptcies, your children's fortunes, which are larger<br>
than my own children's, the buying the estate we live on, and several<br>
other things, which my receipts and notes will account for, as you may<br>
see after my decease. I have, to oblige you on this head, almost<br>
descended to particulars, which I never thought to have done; but as I<br>
have, rest yourself contented, and be well assured that I have not<br>
wilfully thrown any of your substance away.&quot;<br>
<br>
I could not tell what he meant by saying he had not wilfully thrown any<br>
of my substance away. These words puzzled me, for I found by his<br>
discourse I was to have but &pound;500 of all I had brought him, at his<br>
decease, which I looked upon to be near at hand. I had but one thing<br>
that was any satisfaction to me, which was this: I was assured by him<br>
that he had not bestowed above the &pound;15,000 he mentioned to me, on his<br>
children by his former wife; and, on an exact calculation, he made it<br>
appear that he had bestowed on my son Thomas alone near &pound;13,000 in<br>
buying the plantation, shares in vessels, and merchandise, besides<br>
several valuable presents sent to his wife, both by him and me; and as<br>
for my daughter Susanna, she was very well married to a factor, with a<br>
fortune of &pound;2000 (which was a great sum of money for a woman to have who<br>
was immediately to go to the East Indies), besides some handsome<br>
presents given to her both by him and me. In fact, her fortune was, in<br>
proportion, as large as her brother's, for there is but very few women<br>
in England or Holland with &pound;2000 fortune that would venture to the coast<br>
of Malabar, even to have married an Indian king, much more to have gone<br>
over with a person that no one could tell what reception he might meet<br>
with, or might be recalled at the pleasure of the Company upon the least<br>
distaste taken by the merchants against him. Neither would I, though her<br>
own mother, hinder her voyage, for she had been the author of all the<br>
misfortunes that happened to me; and if my speaking a word would have<br>
saved her from the greatest torment, I believe I should have been quite<br>
silent. And I had but one reason to allege for the girl's going so<br>
hazardous a voyage, which is, she knew that the match was proposed by my<br>
lord, and if he had not thought it would have been advantageous for her,<br>
he would never have given &pound;2000 to her husband as a fortune; and again,<br>
as my lord was the only friend she had in our family, she was cunning<br>
enough to know that the bare disobliging of him would have been her ruin<br>
for ever after; to which I may add, that it is possible, as she had made<br>
so much mischief about me, she was glad to get what she could and go out<br>
of the way, for fear my lord and I should be friends; which, if that had<br>
happened, she would have been told never to come to our house any more.<br>
<br>
As my lord's death began to be daily the discourse of the family, I<br>
thought that he might be more reconciled if I entered into the arguments<br>
again, pro and con, which we had together before. I did so, but all I<br>
could say was no satisfaction, till I importuned him on my knees, with a<br>
flood of tears. &quot;Madam,&quot; said he, &quot;what would you have me do?&quot; &quot;Do, my<br>
lord,&quot; said I, &quot;only be so tender to my years and circumstances as to<br>
alter your will, or, at least, add a codicil to it; I desire nothing<br>
more, for I declare I had rather be a beggar, than live under my<br>
child's jurisdiction.&quot; To this he agreed with some reluctance, and he<br>
added a codicil to his will.<br>
<br>
This pleased me greatly, and gave me comfort, for I dreaded nothing so<br>
much, after all my high living, as being under any person, relation or<br>
stranger, and whether they exercised any power over me or not.<br>
<br>
I saw the lawyer come out of the chamber first, but was above asking him<br>
any questions; the next were the executors and chaplain. I asked the<br>
last how they came to have words. He did not answer me directly, but<br>
begged to know whose pleasure it was to have the codicil annexed. &quot;It<br>
was mine, sir,&quot; replied I; &quot;and it made me very uneasy before I could<br>
have the favour granted.&quot; He only replied by saying, &quot;Ah! poor lady, the<br>
favour, as you are pleased to term it, is not calculated for any benefit<br>
to you; think the worst you can of it.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was terribly uneasy at what the chaplain had said, but I imagined to<br>
myself that I could not be worse off than I thought I should be before<br>
the codicil was annexed; and as he withdrew without saying any more, I<br>
was fain to rest satisfied with what I had heard, and that amounted to<br>
nothing.<br>
<br>
The next day after this the physicians that attended my lord told him it<br>
was time for him to settle his worldly affairs, and prepare himself for<br>
a hereafter. I now found all was over, and I had no other hopes of his<br>
life than the physicians' declaration of his being near his death. For<br>
it often happens that the gentlemen of the faculty give out that a man<br>
is near his death, to make the cure appear to be the effect of their<br>
great skill in distempers and medicine; as others, when they cannot find<br>
out the real disease, give out that a man's end is near, rather than<br>
discover their want of judgment; and this I thought might be the case<br>
with our doctors of physic.<br>
<br>
Our son was still kept from the university, and lodged at the house of<br>
one of his future guardians; but when he heard that his father was so<br>
near his end, he was very little out of his presence, for he dearly<br>
loved him. My lord sent the day before his death to lock and seal up all<br>
the doors in his dwelling house at The Hague; and the steward had<br>
orders, in case of my lord's decease, not to let anybody come in, not<br>
even his lady (who had for some time lodged in the same house with her<br>
lord), without an order from the executors.<br>
<br>
The keys of the doors were carried to him, and as he saw his death<br>
approach, he prepared for it, and, in fact, resigned up the keys of<br>
everything to the executors, and having bid them all a farewell, they<br>
were dismissed. The physicians waited; but as the verge of life<br>
approached, and it was out of their power to do him any service, he gave<br>
them a bill of &pound;100 for the care they had taken of him, and dismissed<br>
them.<br>
<br>
I now went into the chamber, and kneeling by his bedside, kissed him<br>
with great earnestness, and begged of him, if ever I had disobliged him<br>
in any respect, to forgive me. He sighed, and said he most freely<br>
forgave me everything that I had reason to think I had offended him in;<br>
but he added, &quot;If you had been so open in your conversation to me before<br>
our marriage as to discover your family and way of life, I know not but<br>
that I should have married you as I did. I might now have been in a good<br>
state of health, and you many years have lived with all the honours due<br>
to the Countess de Wintselsheim.&quot; These words drew tears from my eyes,<br>
and they being the last of any consequence he said, they had the greater<br>
impression upon me. He faintly bid me a long farewell, and said, as he<br>
had but a few moments to live, he hoped I would retire, and leave him<br>
with our son and chaplain. I withdrew into my own chamber, almost<br>
drowned in tears, and my son soon followed me out, leaving the chaplain<br>
with his father, offering up his prayers to Heaven for the receiving of<br>
his soul into the blessed mansions of eternal bliss.<br>
<br>
A few minutes after our son went into the chamber with me again, and<br>
received his father's last blessing. The chaplain now saw him departing,<br>
and was reading the prayer ordered by the Church for that occasion; and<br>
while he was doing it, my lord laid his head gently on the pillow, and<br>
turning on his left side, departed this life with all the calmness of a<br>
composed mind, without so much as a groan, in the fifty-seventh year of<br>
his age.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was dead an undertaker was sent for, by order of the<br>
executors, who met together immediately to open his will, and take care<br>
of all my son's effects. I was present when it was opened and read; but<br>
how terribly I was frightened at hearing the codicil repeated any person<br>
may imagine by the substance of it, which was to this effect; that if I<br>
had given me any more after his decease than the &pound;500 he had left me,<br>
the &pound;500 left to his executors, and the &pound;1000 of my son's estate (which<br>
was now a year's interest), was to be given to such poor families at The<br>
Hague as were judged to be in the greatest want of it; not to be divided<br>
into equal sums, but every family to have according to their merit and<br>
necessity. But this was not all. My son was tied down much harder; for<br>
if it was known that he gave me any relief, let my condition be ever so<br>
bad, either by himself, by his order, or in any manner of way, device,<br>
or contrivance that he could think of, one-half of his estate, which was<br>
particularly mentioned, was to devolve to the executors for ever; and if<br>
they granted me ever so small a favour, that sum was to be equally<br>
divided among the several parishes where they lived, for the benefit of<br>
the poor.<br>
<br>
Any person would have been surprised to have seen how we all sat staring<br>
at each other; for though it was signed by all the executors, yet they<br>
did not know the substance of it till it was publicly read, excepting<br>
the chaplain; and he, as I mentioned before, had told me the codicil had<br>
better never have been added.<br>
<br>
I was now in a fine dilemma; had the title of a countess, with &pound;500, and<br>
nothing else to subsist on but a very good wardrobe of clothes, which<br>
were not looked upon by my son and the executors to be my late lord's<br>
property, and which were worth, indeed, more than treble the sum I had<br>
left me.<br>
<br>
I immediately removed from the lodgings, and left them to bury the body<br>
when they thought proper, and retired to a lodging at a private<br>
gentleman's house, about a mile from The Hague. I was now resolved to<br>
find out Amy, being, as it were, at liberty; and accordingly went to the<br>
house where she had lived, and finding that empty, inquired for her<br>
among the neighbours, who gave various accounts of what had become of<br>
her; but one of them had a direction left at his house where she might<br>
be found. I went to the place and found the house shut up, and all the<br>
windows broken, the sign taken down, and the rails and benches pulled<br>
from before the door. I was quite ashamed to ask for her there, for it<br>
was a very scandalous neighbourhood, and I concluded that Amy had been<br>
brought to low circumstances, and had kept a house of ill-fame, and was<br>
either run away herself, or was forced to it by the officers of justice.<br>
However, as nobody knew me here, I went into a shop to buy some trifles,<br>
and asked who had lived in the opposite house (meaning Amy's). &quot;Really,<br>
madam,&quot; says the woman, &quot;I do not well know; but it was a woman who kept<br>
girls for gentlemen; she went on in that wickedness for some time, till<br>
a gentleman was robbed there of his watch and a diamond ring, on which<br>
the women were all taken up, and committed to the house of correction;<br>
but the young ones are now at liberty, and keep about the town.&quot; &quot;Pray,&quot;<br>
said I, &quot;what may have become of the old beast that could be the ruin of<br>
those young creatures?&quot; &quot;Why, I do not well know,&quot; says she; &quot;but I have<br>
heard that, as all her goods were seized upon, she was sent to the<br>
poorhouse; but it soon after appearing that she had the French disease<br>
to a violent degree, was removed to a hospital to be taken care of, but<br>
I believe she will never live to come out; and if she should be so<br>
fortunate, the gentleman that was robbed, finding that she was the<br>
guilty person, intends to prosecute her to the utmost rigour of the<br>
law.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was sadly surprised to hear this character of Amy; for I thought<br>
whatever house she might keep, that the heyday of her blood had been<br>
over. But I found that she had not been willing to be taken for an old<br>
woman, though near sixty years of age; and my not seeing or hearing from<br>
her for some time past was a confirmation of what had been told me.<br>
<br>
I went home sadly dejected, considering how I might hear of her. I had<br>
known her for a faithful servant to me, in all my bad and good fortune,<br>
and was sorry that at the last such a miserable end should overtake her,<br>
though she, as well as I, deserved it several years before.<br>
<br>
A few days after I went pretty near the place I had heard she was, and<br>
hired a poor woman to go and inquire how Amy ---- did, and whether she<br>
was likely to do well. The woman returned, and told me that the matron,<br>
or mistress, said, the person I inquired after died in a salivation two<br>
days before, and was buried the last night in the cemetery belonging to<br>
the hospital.<br>
<br>
I was very sorry to hear of Amy's unhappy and miserable death; for when<br>
she came first into my service she was really a sober girl, very witty<br>
and brisk, but never impudent, and her notions in general were good,<br>
till my forcing her, as it were, to have an intrigue with the jeweller.<br>
She had also lived with me between thirty and forty years, in the<br>
several stages of life as I had passed through; and as I had done<br>
nothing but what she was privy to, so she was the best person in the<br>
universal world to consult with and take advice from, as my<br>
circumstances now were.<br>
<br>
I returned to my lodgings much chagrined, and very disconsolate; for as<br>
I had for several years lived at the pinnacle of splendour and<br>
satisfaction, it was a prodigious heart-break to me now to fall from<br>
upwards of &pound;3000 per annum to a poor &pound;500 principal.<br>
<br>
A few days after this I went to see my son, the Earl of Wintselsheim. He<br>
received me in a very courteous (though far from a dutiful) manner. We<br>
talked together near an hour upon general things, but had no particular<br>
discourse about my late lord's effects, as I wanted to have. Among<br>
other things he told me that his guardians had advised him to go to the<br>
university for four years longer, when he would come of age, and his<br>
estate would be somewhat repaired; to which he said he had agreed; and<br>
for that purpose all the household goods and equipages were to be<br>
disposed of the next week, and the servants dismissed. I immediately<br>
asked if it would be looked upon as an encroachment upon his father's<br>
will if I took Isabel (who had been my waiting-maid ever since I came<br>
from England) to live with me. &quot;No, my lady,&quot; very readily replied he;<br>
&quot;as she will be dismissed from me, she is certainly at liberty and full<br>
freedom to do for herself as soon and in the best manner she possibly<br>
can.&quot; After this I stayed about a quarter of an hour with him, and then<br>
I sent for Isabel, to know if she would come and live with me on her<br>
dismission from her lord's. The girl readily consented, for I had always<br>
been a good mistress to her; and then I went to my own lodgings in my<br>
son's coach, which he had ordered to be got ready to carry me home.<br>
<br>
Isabel came, according to appointment, about ten days after, and told me<br>
the house was quite cleared both of men and movables, but said her lord<br>
(meaning my son) was not gone to the university as yet, but was at one<br>
of his guardians' houses, where he would stay about a month, and that he<br>
intended to make a visit before his departure, which he did, attended by<br>
my late chaplain; and I, being in handsome lodgings, received them with<br>
all the complaisance and love as was possible, telling them that time<br>
and circumstances having greatly varied with me, whatever they saw amiss<br>
I hoped they would be so good as to look over it at that time, by<br>
considering the unhappy situation of my affairs.<br>
<br>
After this visit was over, and I had myself and Isabel to provide for,<br>
handsome lodgings to keep (which were as expensive as they were fine),<br>
and nothing but my principal money to live on (I mean what I happened to<br>
have in my pocket at my lord's death, for I had not been paid my &pound;500 as<br>
yet), I could not manage for a genteel maintenance as I had done some<br>
years before. I thought of divers things to lay my small sums out to<br>
advantage, but could fix on nothing; for it always happens that when<br>
people have but a trifle, they are very dubious in the disposal of it.<br>
<br>
Having been long resolving in my mind, I at last fixed on merchandise as<br>
the most genteel and profitable of anything else. Accordingly I went to<br>
a merchant who was intimate with my late lord, and letting him know how<br>
my circumstances were, he heartily condoled with me, and told me he<br>
could help me to a share in two ships--one was going a trading voyage to<br>
the coast of Africa, and the other a-privateering. I was now in a<br>
dilemma, and was willing to have a share in the trader, but was dubious<br>
of being concerned in the privateer; for I had heard strange stories<br>
told of the gentlemen concerned in that way of business. Nay, I had<br>
been told, but with what certainty I cannot aver, that there was a set<br>
of men who took upon them to issue ships, and as they always knew to<br>
what port they are bound, notice was sent to their correspondent abroad<br>
to order out their privateers on the coast the other sailed, and they<br>
knowing the loading, and the numbers of hands and guns were on board,<br>
soon made prizes of the vessels, and the profits were equally divided,<br>
after paying what was paid for their insurance, among them all.<br>
<br>
However, I at last resolved, by the merchant's advice, to have a share<br>
in the trader, and the next day he over-persuaded me to have a share in<br>
the privateer also. But that I may not lay out my money before I have<br>
it, it may not be amiss to observe that I went to the executors and<br>
received my &pound;500 at an hour's notice, and then went to the merchant's to<br>
know what the shares would come to, and being told &pound;1500, I was resolved<br>
to raise the money; so I went home, and, with my maid Isabel, in two<br>
days' time disposed of as many of my clothes as fetched me near &pound;1100,<br>
which, joined to the above sum, I carried to the merchant's, where the<br>
writings were drawn, signed, sealed, and delivered to me in the presence<br>
of two witnesses, who went with me for that purpose. The ships were near<br>
ready for sailing; the trader was so well manned and armed, as well as<br>
the privateer, that the partners would not consent to insure them, and<br>
out they both sailed, though from different ports, and I depended on<br>
getting a good estate between them.<br>
<br>
When I was about this last ship a letter came from the count, my son,<br>
full of tender expressions of his duty to me, in which I was informed<br>
that he was going again to the university at Paris, where he should<br>
remain four years; after that he intended to make the tour of Europe,<br>
and then come and settle at The Hague. I returned him thanks in a letter<br>
for his compliment, wished him all happiness, and a safe return to<br>
Holland, and desired that he would write to me from time to time that I<br>
might hear of his welfare, which was all I could now expect of him. But<br>
this was the last time I heard from him, or he from me.<br>
<br>
In about a month's time the news came that the privateer (which sailed<br>
under British colours, and was divided into eight shares) had taken a<br>
ship, and was bringing it into the Texel, but that it accidentally<br>
foundered, and being chained to the privateer, had, in sinking, like to<br>
have lost that too. Two or three of the hands got on shore, and came to<br>
The Hague; but how terribly I was alarmed any one may judge, when I<br>
heard the ship the privateer had was the Newfoundland merchantman, as I<br>
had bought two shares in out of four. About two months after news was<br>
current about The Hague of a privateer or merchantman, one of them of<br>
the town, though not known which, having an engagement in the<br>
Mediterranean, in which action both the privateer and trader was lost.<br>
Soon after their names were publicly known, and, in the end, my partners<br>
heard that they were our ships, and unhappily sailing under false<br>
colours (a thing often practised in the time of war), and never having<br>
seen each other, had, at meeting, a very smart engagement, each fighting<br>
for life and honour, till two unfortunate shots; one of them, viz., the<br>
privateer, was sunk by a shot between wind and water, and the trader<br>
unhappily blown up by a ball falling in the powder-room. There were only<br>
two hands of the trader, and three of the privateer, that escaped, and<br>
they all fortunately met at one of the partners' houses, where they<br>
confirmed the truth of this melancholy story, and to me a fatal loss.<br>
<br>
What was to be done now? I had no money, and but few clothes left;<br>
there, was no hope of subsistence from my son or his guardians; they<br>
were tied down to be spectators of my misfortunes, without affording me<br>
any redress, even if they would.<br>
<br>
Isabel, though I was now reduced to the last penny, would live with me<br>
still, and, as I observed before and may now repeat, I was in a pretty<br>
situation to begin the world--upwards of sixty years of age, friendless,<br>
scanty of clothes, and but very little money.<br>
<br>
I proposed to Isabel to remove from lodgings and retire to Amsterdam,<br>
where I was not known, and might turn myself into some little way of<br>
business, and work for that bread now which had been too often<br>
squandered away upon very trifles. And upon consideration I found myself<br>
in a worse condition than I thought, for I had nothing to recommend me<br>
to Heaven, either in works or thoughts; had even banished from my mind<br>
all the cardinal and moral virtues, and had much more reason to hide<br>
myself from the sight of God, if possible, than I had to leave The<br>
Hague, that I might not be known of my fellow-creatures. And farther to<br>
hasten our removing to Amsterdam, I recollected I was involved in debt<br>
for money to purchase a share in the Newfoundland trader, which was<br>
lost, and my creditors daily threatened me with an arrest to make me pay<br>
them.<br>
<br>
I soon discharged my lodgings and went with Isabel to Amsterdam, where I<br>
thought, as I was advanced in years, to give up all I could raise in the<br>
world, and on the sale of everything I had to go into one of the<br>
Proveniers' houses, where I should be settled for life. But as I could<br>
not produce enough money for it, I turned it into a coffee-house near<br>
the Stadt-house, where I might have done well; but as soon as I was<br>
settled one of my Hague creditors arrested me for a debt of &pound;75, and I<br>
not having a friend in the world of whom to raise the money, was, in a<br>
shameful condition, carried to the common jail, where poor Isabel<br>
followed me with showers of tears, and left me inconsolable for my great<br>
misfortunes. Here, without some very unforeseen accident, I shall never<br>
go out of it until I am carried to my grave, for which my much-offended<br>
God prepare me as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
_The continuation of the Life of Roxana, by Isabel Johnson, who had<br>
been her waiting-maid, from the time she was thrown into jail to<br>
the time of her death._<br>
<br>
After my lady, as it was my duty to call her, was thrown into jail for a<br>
debt she was unable to pay, she gave her mind wholly up to devotion.<br>
Whether it was from a thorough sense of her wretched state, or any other<br>
reason, I could never learn; but this I may say, that she was a sincere<br>
penitent, and in every action had all the behaviour of a Christian. By<br>
degrees all the things she had in the world were sold, and she began to<br>
find an inward decay upon her spirits. In this interval she repeated all<br>
the passages of her ill-spent life to me, and thoroughly repented of<br>
every bad action, especially the little value she had for her children,<br>
which were honestly born and bred. And having, as she believed, made her<br>
peace with God, she died with mere grief on the 2nd of July 1742, in the<br>
sixty-fifth year of her age, and was decently buried by me in the<br>
churchyard belonging to the Lutherans, in the city of Amsterdam.<br>
