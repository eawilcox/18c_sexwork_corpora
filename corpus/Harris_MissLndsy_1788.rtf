 Street_.<br>
<br>
 What pity 'tis so fine a face and form<br>
 Should suffer pride, the cankerworms of joy,<br>
 That beauty to deform.<br>
<br>
 If a warm son of Bacchus, flush'd with<br>
the fullness of desire impetuous, Would wish<br>
to melt a haughty temper down to the<br>
standard of all complying love, let him<br>
repair to this imperious golden hair'd<br>
beauty, for however proud, she will stoop<br>
to conquer any bold _invader_; and you<br>
may lay her on her back by closing with<br>
her in the athletic exercise of wrestling,<br>
as she is very fond of Cupid's _hug_, and the<br>
amorous _lock_, and will wait your _further_<br>
attack with becoming spirit, and engage<br>
your _champion_ of her _ring_, with a grasp,<br>
till he is reduced to _bend_ beneath the<br>
powerful squeeze, and _yield_ all the _metal_<br>
he has about him to his circling antago-<br>
nist, who, so far from behaving ungene-<br>
rous, will give out in exchange as much,<br>
or more rich treasure of another coin, in<br>
token of mutual amity; in short she is as<br>
smart a little girl as you will in general<br>
see of her complexion and size, and bor-<br>
rows her name from a gentleman who is<br>
a very good friend, but does not expect<br>
her to confine the whole of her favours to<br>
him alone; but allows her to pick up her<br>
odd guineas as she pleases.</font></span></font></body>
