Mrs. Bi\'97d, No, 27, Salisbury-street, Strand.\
\
For 'tis in vain to guess \
At women by appearances; \
They paint and patch their imperfections \
Of intellectual complexions, \
And daub their tempers o'er with washes, \
As artificial as their faces.\
\
Those who keep ladies do not seem to regard their charms, but become \
keepers because it is the fashion. But she cannot be admired on \
account of her charms, for she has very few; indeed we are so blind \
that we cannot discern any. She is tall and lusty, has a dead eye and \
flattish nose, and good teeth, and is very much given to laughing, \
she wears short petticoats. We do not know whether her favours are \
bestowed for money or love, but this we are certain of, that C\'97 H\'97 is \
not the only man who experiences the happiness of her voluptuous \
favours, which are very numerous.\
