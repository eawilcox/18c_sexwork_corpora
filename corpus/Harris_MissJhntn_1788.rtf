 Court, St. Martin's Lane_.<br>
<br>
 Here roses red, and lilys fair;<br>
 The gifts of nature, deck her air.<br>
<br>
 Oh for a touch of the pencil of anima-<br>
tion to color the picture of one of the most<br>
lively productions in our exhibition; she<br>
is genteel and well made, with a beautiful<br>
face, the tints in which are done by<br>
nature alone, fine light hair, and a pretty<br>
learing eye, that would make a monk<br>
disregard his vow of celibacy, or a<br>
mahometan think that he had got one of<br>
the daughters of paradise; her mouth<br>
small, her lips tempting; her teeth even,<br>
white, and regular; her foot and leg<br>
smart, and her dress at once neat and<br>
genteel. But these are not the sole<br>
powers of this lady; she is acquainted at<br>
once with the whole rationale of love, as<br>
well as with the entire practice of it; and<br>
whether we talk of those mysteries which<br>
are only known by the adepts, or those<br>
more clumsily applied operations of the<br>
lower orders of the sisterhood, she is up<br>
to every thing in love's tactics. Her<br>
dialect does not tell us she is a native of<br>
Scotland, tho' her father, who is an<br>
half pay officer, yet resides there; at<br>
this period when the powers of love or<br>
lust are at their full bloom, necessity and<br>
inclination together, prompted her to<br>
become a dancer on our cyprian stage,<br>
and is very desirous of pleasing every<br>
man that makes her his partner, and is<br>
so very careful of her health, that before<br>
she receives her _guinea_, she must examine<br>
every _one_ of her partner's _legs_.</font></span></font></body>
