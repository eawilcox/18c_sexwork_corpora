<body><font face="Courier"><span style="font-size:13pt"><font color="#000000">Miss Fanny H--nl--y, No 14, _King-<br>
 Street, Saint James's Square_.<br>
<br>
 Her every thought, and wishes, and desires,<br>
 Agree with yours, and burn with mutual fires.<br>
<br>
 This merry, little lively tit appears to<br>
be about sixteen, and is never to be met<br>
without a smile upon her countenance,<br>
and a frisky song at her tongue's end;<br>
she is very short, a brunette in com-<br>
plexion, with a lustfully sparkling eye,<br>
and jetty ringlets down her back. The sis-<br>
ter hills, with their bewitching coral<br>
pinnacles, are irresistibly firm, and speak<br>
their silent language very forcibly to the<br>
heart. The grove beneath, shading the<br>
font of life, is drest in sable, and se-<br>
cures the _internal mansion_ from any sud-<br>
den _attack_. She is generally very expe-<br>
ditious in dying, therefore we would ad-<br>
vise her antagonist to push the warm con-<br>
est with agility, or it will not be a _dead_<br>
heat; she is a very willing and amorous<br>
bedfellow, never against repetition, and<br>
such a good natured, and good tem-<br>
per'd creature, that she seems to say to<br>
every one,<br>
<br>
 With thee secur'd,--I'd smile at fortune's<br>
 frowns,<br>
 And all her threats defy,--nor court her<br>
 smiles.<br>
