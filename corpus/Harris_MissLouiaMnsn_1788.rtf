<br>
 What various charms can M-ns-n boast,<br>
 By nature thus befriended;<br>
 Whose legs impart a charm when cross'd,<br>
 And charming when extended.<br>
<br>
 Observe her well, the oblique glance,<br>
the lascivious look, the frequent heave of<br>
the breasts fully speak her inward feel-<br>
ings; but can any of our readers account<br>
for her immoderate fondness for sugar<br>
plumbs? it must certainly be that that<br>
induced, her to take the famous little<br>
Jemmy B--tl--r into her train, the<br>
_upper mouth_ he keeps constantly supplied<br>
with its favourite food; but we fear<br>
_Jemmy_ has not parts sufficient to supply<br>
the _lower_ with a tenth part of _its_ neces-<br>
sary food. She therefore solicits the<br>
favours of the good natured public for<br>
the necessary supplies to that inchanting<br>
spot. She is of a good size, and every<br>
limb well proportioned. Knowing the<br>
beauty of her hand and arm, she takes<br>
particular care they shall not pass un-<br>
noticed for want of being seen; convinced<br>
of the delicate proportion of her leg and<br>
foot, she is very careful their covering<br>
shall not discredit them, and has a<br>
pleasing knack of keeping them con-<br>
stantly exposed to sight; and being<br>
taught by the eyes of her admirers the<br>
influence her neck and breasts command,<br>
she covers them with so thin a veil, that<br>
the smallest blue branch is easily<br>
covered; her eyes she cannot hide, nor<br>
does she wish it; they are plain indications<br>
of nature's central spot, and beam with<br>
all the fire of the _enchanting spot_. Two<br>
guineas is her price, and should Jemmy<br>
be there he must retire if she thinks fit.<br>
