 ford Market_.<br>
<br>
 Give me plenty of bub,<br>
 From the large brandy tub,<br>
 And I'll _spend_ the whole night in your arms,<br>
 I'll expose every part<br>
 Of my brown _apple cart_,<br>
 And stifle, quite stifle the _boy_ in its _charms_.<br>
<br>
 I hope none of our readers will proves a<br>
Mr. L-d-tt, who, about six months ago,<br>
from a mere silly quarrel with this his fa-<br>
vourite fair, thought it convenient to fin-<br>
ish his existence in the _leaden way_; she<br>
does not possess either youth or novelty<br>
sufficient to tempt many, to act in that<br>
way, having been at least seven years a<br>
trading nymph to our knowledge; she is<br>
tall, and genteelly made, with a fine skin,<br>
and beautiful flaxen hair, but is too fond<br>
of the brandy bottle to give that sincere<br>
delight, that _mutual interchange of souls_<br>
so necessary to stamp the _extatic rapture_;<br>
she may, however, prove to those that<br>
will drink a glass with her, and has no<br>
objection to become as merry as herself,<br>
a desireable piece, as she is neither extra-<br>
vagant in her demands, or nice in the<br>
choicee of her admirers.</font></span></font></body>
