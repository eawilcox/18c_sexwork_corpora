<body><font face="Courier"><span style="font-size:13pt"><font color="#000000">Miss R--fs, at Mrs. Wanpoles, No. 1,<br>
 _Poland-Street_.<br>
<br>
 Soft, as when the wooing dove,<br>
 Woo's his mate in vernal bowr's,<br>
 Is this purest child of love,<br>
 When she her _choicest treasure pours_.<br>
<br>
 Here youth and beauty are combined,<br>
and unadorned by education or art; what<br>
she _feels_ in the _amorous encounter_ cannot<br>
be feigned. Her natural simplicity is<br>
yet so unstained, and her knowledge of<br>
the world so very little, that it is almost<br>
impossible for her to dissemble; her<br>
hair, eye-brows and eyes, are of the<br>
deepest black; her complexion of the<br>
roses red, and her neck and breasts of<br>
the purest white; her limbs are nobly<br>
formed, every joint possessing the most<br>
enchanting flexibility, which she mana-<br>
ges with uncommon dexterity, and her<br>
_Venus Mount_ is so _nobly fortified_, that she<br>
has no occasion to dread the _fiercest at-<br>
tack_, nor does she: and although she is<br>
obliged to make sudden _retreats_, her _ad-<br>
vances_ follow so very brisk, and are so<br>
effectual, that<br>
<br>
 Whene'er she quits the field,<br>
 Waits _vice_ on her _lovely shield_.<br>
<br>
but we must advise our lovers of the sport<br>
to keep her pleased, as her temper, a<br>
little different from _another part_, is not<br>
to be sported with.</font></span></font></body>
