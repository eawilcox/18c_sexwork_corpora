 Chesterfield-Street_.<br>
<br>
 Loves subtle fluid, and life's thrilling kiss<br>
 Glide thro' her frame, and speak the coming<br>
 bliss.<br>
<br>
In this age of gallantry and pleasure,<br>
when epicurism is so much practised,<br>
and variety so much sought after, we are<br>
happy in being able to serve up a dish to<br>
every palate, and here present our readers<br>
with as delicious a one (that is when she<br>
does not smell of brandy) as would be<br>
provided by the hand of luxury itself,<br>
and stimulate the most languid appetite<br>
to fall on with the greatest _gou_; for in<br>
Betsy is comprised an epitome of delight,<br>
rather above mediocrity in her size, fine<br>
dark eyes and hair, and a fine durable<br>
complexion, and teeth that needs not the<br>
dentist nor his dentrifice; and a pair of<br>
tempting full formed breasts, made for<br>
the swelling yielding joy, and to send the<br>
murmurring sigh of rapture to the breath-<br>
ing trembling lips; and at the critical<br>
juncture of supreme pleasure, her whole<br>
spirit seems to dissolve within her, weep<br>
thro' all her frame with exquisitely<br>
thrilling languor, and _pour down_ to<br>
the _centrical point_ from every _Cyprian<br>
spring_ a whole flood of _liquid life_: for a<br>
nocturnal bathe in this Cyprian spring,<br>
she expects at least two guineas.</font></span></font></body>
