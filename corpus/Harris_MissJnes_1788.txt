 Oxford-Street_.<br>
<br>
 ------------Oh she's all softness,<br>
 All melting mild, and calm as a rock'd infant;<br>
 Nor can you wake her into cries, by heaven!<br>
 She's the child of love, and she was born in<br>
 smiles.<br>
<br>
 Oh may the giddy rake, whose head<br>
overpowered by the effects of the grape,<br>
whose every thought, whose every idea<br>
lies centered in the gratification of a<br>
sensual appetite; whole impetuosity in-<br>
discriminately rushes him on the first<br>
object that presents herself, may he, at<br>
this his most unguarded hour, rest in the<br>
arms of this enchanting girl whose good<br>
nature, care, and attention, might make<br>
him reflect with pleasure on the past<br>
folly. In her he'll meet with every<br>
pleasing accomplishment the heart of<br>
man could wish; her natural disposition<br>
as yet remains unvitiated by the knowledge<br>
of the world, or corrupted by the hand<br>
of time. She is now in her eighteenth<br>
year, with every amorous feeling nature<br>
at this youthful period can furnish her<br>
with; nor is she desirous of keeping<br>
those feelings a secret. Look in those<br>
fine black eyes, there read the perfect<br>
language of her soul, for never was<br>
_silent language_ so fully seen and felt; she<br>
has a fine open handsome countenance,<br>
tall of stature, and if her man is pleased<br>
with a good song, he won't be didappoint-<br>
ed by putting the request to our sweet<br>
J--nes, whose good nature is such she<br>
never refuses,<br>
<br>
 Or should he wish to join the merry dance,<br>
 Where the brisk couplets artfully advance.<br>
<br>
Here likewise with our charmer as a<br>
partner would he be equally delighted;<br>
here she displays such a leg and foot, and<br>
with so much activity, sprightliness, and<br>
judgment, that none can see but admire,<br>
admire but love; with all these qualifi-<br>
cations, say you, she cannot be a bad<br>
bedfellow; she has equal merits in bed,<br>
and pleases there with equal certainty.<br>
She is neither covetous, nor will she<br>
sink below what her real merits deserve;<br>
if after this, and our readers recollecting<br>
she is but lately arrived from the lewd<br>
mountains of Wales, he thinks two<br>
guineas to much, he had better steer some<br>
other course.</font></span></font></body>
