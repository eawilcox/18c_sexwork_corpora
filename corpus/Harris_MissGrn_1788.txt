<br>
 Strait a new heat return'd with his embrace,<br>
Warmth to my blood and colour to my face;<br>
Till at the length, with mutual kisses fir'd,)<br>
To the last bliss we eagerly aspir'd, ]<br>
And both alike attain'd, what both alike )<br>
 desir'd.<br>
<br>
When beauty beats up for recruits, he<br>
must be an errant coward indeed, who re-<br>
fuses to enlist under its banner; and<br>
when good humour, complaisance, and<br>
engaging behaviour are the rewards of<br>
service, it is shameful to desert. This<br>
lady's charms attract most who behold<br>
them; though of a low stature, and<br>
rather under the middle size, she is ele-<br>
gantly formed; her black eyes, contrasted<br>
with her white teeth, are highly pleasing,<br>
and the goodness of her temper rivets the<br>
chains which her agreeable form first put<br>
one. One guinea, is then, too poor a re-<br>
compence for such merit; and it is to be<br>
deplored, that a girl, who should only<br>
exchange love for love, should be obliged<br>
to take payment for what is ever beyond<br>
price: in bed, she is by far the better<br>
piece, and is up to every manoeuvre<br>
necessary to restore life, and every<br>
luscious _move_ to destroy; hands, tongue,<br>
lips, legs, and every part of the busy<br>
frame is engaged at once in the pleasing<br>
task, and all to provoke and bring the<br>
_soul breathing conflict_ to the _last extatic<br>
gush_.</font></span></font></body>
