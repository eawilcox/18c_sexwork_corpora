 Queen-Ann-Street East_.<br>
 -----------Lilting o'er the lea,<br>
 Ye're welcomer to take me, than to let me be.<br>
<br>
She is tall and fair, of a striking figure,<br>
and amiable in conversation, perfectly<br>
complying with the desires of her ena-<br>
morato's: she is said, like the river<br>
Nile, frequently to overflow, but some-<br>
how or another her inundations differ<br>
from those of that river, as they do not<br>
produce foecundity, some skilful gar-<br>
deners are of opinion that she drowns<br>
the _seed_, which is the reason that it does<br>
not take root. This, is a disagreeable<br>
circumstance to those who may wish not<br>
to till in vain; but to others who would<br>
prefer the pleasure without the expensive<br>
consequences, she is the more desirable,<br>
as they are sure that all who bathe in her<br>
_Castalian spring_, will be overwhelmed<br>
with a flood of delight.<br>
