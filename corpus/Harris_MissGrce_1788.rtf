<br>
 Forc'd to consent, but never to obey,<br>
 Panting he lies; the _liquid minute_ pass'd,<br>
 She feedeth on the _stream_ as on a prey,<br>
 And calls it heavenly moisture.<br>
<br>
Some ladies prefer the profit, others<br>
the pleasure; some may divide it equally<br>
in their choice, and perhaps their may<br>
be, among Venus's tribe, the lady found<br>
almost indifferent to either; this lady<br>
however we may venture to affirm is not<br>
of the last stamp; she is a fine inviting<br>
looking girl, with very lively Cupidinous<br>
eyes and a good complexion, and scarcely<br>
ever to be found but in a good humour;<br>
and her paramour, provided he can prove<br>
himself the good bed fellow, has nothing<br>
to fear in this lady's company, as money<br>
with her is not the entire object, it is the<br>
enjoyment that constitutes her happiness,<br>
and in that part she is a truly lovely ac-<br>
tress; her twining limbs never forget their<br>
office; her busy lips is mistress of the ge-<br>
nuine burning kiss, and the intermediate<br>
parts move in every direction that can<br>
possibly enhance the coming joy, which<br>
she will powerfully urge a repetition of,<br>
as long as dame nature can possibly af-<br>
ford it. She is at prefent in keeping by<br>
a French count, who though very jea-<br>
lous, often suffers her to sport it in his<br>
chariot, during which time her tell-<br>
tale black eyes, is busy in hunting for ad-<br>
mirers, and can tip the wink and con-<br>
duct him, if approved, to a safe harbour;<br>
and altho' not so very fond of money,<br>
she does not expect to have less than five<br>
guineas offered her.</font></span></font></body>
