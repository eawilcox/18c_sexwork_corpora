 street_.<br>
<br>
 Well pleas'd at the _frolic_, she laugh'd at the<br>
 pain,<br>
 And wish'd with more ardour, to try it again;<br>
 Which, when _handled_ and _dandled_, and made<br>
 fit for use,<br>
 She push'd with less pain, as the parts grew<br>
 more loose;<br>
 Then _upping_ and _downing_, kind nature told<br>
 how,<br>
 She cry'd over-raptur'd, it does not hurt now.<br>
<br>
 This was her confession to her dear Mr.<br>
Wh--te, had she less partiality for him,<br>
her friends in general would have a greater<br>
partiality for her; she has a tolerable pretty<br>
mouth, we wish we could pay her teeth<br>
the same compliment; that mouth she<br>
thinks serves as an index to its _cousin be-<br>
low_; to be sure she has learned the wrig-<br>
ling part of pleasing, and would willing-<br>
lY make her gentlemen believe, when in<br>
the _heat_ of the engagement,' that he is<br>
giving her pain; but however large the<br>
_premises_ may be, she certainly has attained<br>
a very pleasing method of _contracting them_,<br>
never meeting with one she could not per-<br>
fectly well accommodate, from an infant<br>
shoe to a _jack_ boot. She is of the mid-<br>
dling size, with dark hair and eyes; re-<br>
tains a good complexion without the<br>
assistance of rouge or pearl powder; is<br>
very lively and chearful, and as a conver-<br>
sation piece only, would make the time<br>
pass away agreeable enough, being chear-<br>
ful and good humoured, with a pleasant<br>
smile upon her countenance; will drink<br>
a chearful glass to George the third with<br>
pleasure, and whilst she has the glass in<br>
one hand, has no objection to see his<br>
picture in the other; but sooner than her<br>
dear man should want, she would retail her<br>
charms at five shillings an hour all day<br>
long.</font></span></font></body>
