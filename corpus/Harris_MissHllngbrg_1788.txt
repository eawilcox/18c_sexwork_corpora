 Street, East_.<br>
<br>
 In hell and earth, and seas and heaven above,<br>
 Love conquers all, and we must yield to force.<br>
<br>
 This lady, tho' an adept in the art, so<br>
nobly erases true impudence, with false<br>
modesty, that her lover would be almost<br>
lead to think his chosen fair, at first sight,<br>
an immaculate Virgin. The _supreme gush_,<br>
the enraptured moment she so mutually<br>
interchanges, or at least seems so to do,<br>
that she might well be stil'd the paragon<br>
of her sex; and so perfectly well convin-<br>
ced of her own proficiency in the art,<br>
(altho in spite, of those killing lumi-<br>
naries, embellished by a tolerable good<br>
skin, she has too large a mouth ever to<br>
be stil'd a beauty) she never will see her<br>
man a second time, unless Plutus has suf-<br>
ficiently shewn his power first. Our<br>
charmer was taken from her parents, and<br>
taught the use of the _tree of life_ at a very<br>
early period; but never had the good for-<br>
tune on her side to be much exalted: in-<br>
deed, when we consider the more early<br>
part of her life was spent, and the whole<br>
of her education was received in a sea port<br>
town, we cannot be much surprised.</font></span></font></body>
