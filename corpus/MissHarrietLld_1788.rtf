 German-Street_<br>
<br>
 ---------Born with every grace,<br>
 Ev'n envy must applaud so fair a face;<br>
 Such is her form as painters when they show<br>
 Their utmost art, on naked limbs bestow.<br>
<br>
 This pretty little smart girl, this true<br>
lover of the sport, is at present in keeping<br>
by a member of P--------t, not far<br>
from St. James's; but not being suffi-<br>
ciently _membered_ for her _lower house_, she<br>
appropriates the greatest part of the<br>
member's hard coin to support and keep<br>
in good humour two favourites of her<br>
own. The one a tender sprig of the<br>
law, the other a jolly hearty looking<br>
butcher; but still in spite of these three,<br>
she has her _best apartment_ ready for any<br>
one that is master of five guineas, and<br>
will make her mistress of the same;<br>
it is neatly ornamented with chestnut<br>
coloured fringe, is snug and warm, and<br>
when not _too warm_ (which we are told is<br>
sometimes the case) very comfortable;<br>
she is now only seventeen, her dark eyes<br>
have much lustre and more meaning:<br>
her limbs, tho' small, are well shaped,<br>
covered with a skin fair as the swan's<br>
neck, and soft as its down, they are<br>
perfectly pliable, and form a thousand<br>
true lovers knots, first to facilitate the<br>
entrance into her _apartment_, and then<br>
to keep the enraptured lodger there as<br>
long as possible. Indeed, she never lets<br>
one depart till he has paid his _rent_; but<br>
to shew she is not avaricious, she<br>
generally returns as much as she receives,<br>
in the like _metal_, tho' not in the same<br>
coin.</font></span></font></body>
