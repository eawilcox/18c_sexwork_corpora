 Street, Soho_.<br>
<br>
 Then he began to rave and tear,<br>
 And swore once more he'd try the fair<br>
 To grace his notes he would take care,<br>
 She gave her kind consent.<br>
 He pitch'd the highest note he could,<br>
 And kept the stops just where he should,<br>
 Damon, says she, your musick's good,<br>
 And I am now content.<br>
<br>
 This lady, we are told, is remarkably<br>
fond of musick, and there is no _tune_<br>
within _compass of the flute_ but she plays<br>
with the greatest dexterity; she is perfect<br>
mistress of all the _graces_, is never _out_ in<br>
_stopping_, and is full as well skilled in<br>
_pricking_; altho' the principal part of her<br>
_music_ is played in _duets_, and every _duet_<br>
in a _natural key_, she has not the smallest<br>
objection to _two flats_; she has a variety<br>
of sweet notes, and many pleasing _airs_,<br>
and generally chooses the lowest part;<br>
every _shake and quaver_ she feels in-<br>
stinctively, and sometimes has played the<br>
same _tune_ over _twice_, before her partner<br>
has gone through it once, without the<br>
least deviation from true concord; she<br>
does not allow of any _cross barrs_, and is<br>
particularly partial to the _Tacit_ flute;<br>
her moving stars are as black and as<br>
round as the end of a _Crotchet_; no _flower<br>
that blows is like_ her cheek, or _scatters such<br>
perfume_ as her breath: no _advice can<br>
controul her love; she does as she will with<br>
her swain_, presses him _away to the copse_,<br>
puts the _wanton God where the bee sucks into<br>
her pleasant native plains_, soon after you<br>
feel the _graceful move_ and find _how sweet<br>
it is in the low-lands_; and should it be _in<br>
sable night, she loves to restore the drooping<br>
plant_, thinks _variety is charming_, and<br>
always _gives one kind kiss before she parts_;<br>
and as she is now only nineteen, can sing<br>
a French as well as an English song, and<br>
has a very good friend, whose name she at<br>
present assumes: you must not approach<br>
her shrine without being well fortifyed<br>
with _root of all evil_.</font></span></font></body>
