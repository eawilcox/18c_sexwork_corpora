<body>Mrs. R&mdash;ad, No. 66, Queen Anne Street East.<br>
<br>
With the sports of the field, there's no Pleasure can vie, <br>
Then follow, follow, &amp;c. the hounds in full cry.<br>
<br>
A fine tall girl, about twenty-two, elegant in person, with a <br>
captivating countenance. She has found out the true art to please and <br>
be pleased. Mrs. R&mdash;d has very dark eyes and eye-brows, and plenty of <br>
the same colour hair on the enchanting spot of love, being a fine <br>
cover for game. This lady has tasted the sweets of many good things <br>
in purse and person, and relishes them all. Her predominant passion <br>
seems for horses, hounds, and the delights of the field. No one is <br>
more emulous than our heroine, to be in at the death; upon the whole <br>
we may pronounce this lady a woman of taste and spirit, which she <br>
displays in nothing more forcibly, hunting not excepted, than in the <br>
choice of her favourite, as he is still a hunter.<br>
