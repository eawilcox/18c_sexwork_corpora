Miss Fra\'97r, No. 6, Queen-street, Golden Square.\
\
The ridiculous distinctions which tradesmen make among one another, \
were the actual means of placing Miss F\'97 in her present situation. We \
may see every day a wholesale dealer look upon a retailer as \
infinitely below him, and even the Tallow-chandler treats the Butcher \
with contempt, the Butcher in his turn looks down on the poor Barber; \
and the Barber has his triumph over the Blacksmith and the keeper of \
a Chandler's shop; none put themselves on an equality with all except \
the Attorney, who has an opportunity of profiting by other people's \
weakness and absurdities. Nancy is the daughter of a Tradesman, and \
was taught by her parents not for the world to keep company with Miss \
Rappee, the Tobacconist's daughter; who, in her turn was taught to \
despise the Cheesemonger's family: the consequence of which was, that \
being taught to look so much above their own sphere, they became an \
easy prey to men of fashion and were soon abandoned.\
\
Nancy has a good deal of vivacity, and a pretty face, she has a very \
pleasing aquiline nose, has excellent teeth, and good hair, and is \
good natured but rather haughty, she does not much care to give her \
company to any body whose person is not in some measure pleasing to \
her, without they make it well worth her while. She has an open \
manner of discourse in company, which is highly agreeable, and though \
she expects a genteel present, she is by no means mercenary, but \
enjoys the sport with all the vigorous ardour that may be expected \
from a girl of one and twenty\
