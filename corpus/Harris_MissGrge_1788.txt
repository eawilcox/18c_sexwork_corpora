 Moulton-Street_.<br>
<br>
 Hast thou beheld a fresher, sweeter nymph,<br>
 Such war of white and red upon her cheeks,<br>
 What stars do spangle, Heaven, with so much<br>
 beauty,<br>
 As those two eyes become that Heav'nly face.<br>
<br>
 At the tempting luscious age of nine-<br>
teen, this lovely girl presents us with a<br>
face well worth the attention of the _na-<br>
turalist_; She is of a fine fair complexion,<br>
with light brown hair, which waves in<br>
many a graceful ringlet, has good teeth,<br>
and her tell-tale dark eyes, speak indeed,<br>
the tender language of love, and beam<br>
unutterable softness; she is tall of stature;<br>
and of the moft tempting _en bon point_;<br>
plump breasts, which in whiteness sur-<br>
pass the driven _snow_, and melt the most<br>
_snowy_ of mankind to rapture. Her name<br>
she borrows from a gentleman, who,<br>
some little time ago, posessed her (as he<br>
thought) entirely for some time, but find-<br>
ing himslef mistaken, and tired with the<br>
_cornuted_ burthen on his brows, he left her<br>
about six months ago, to seek support in<br>
this grand mart of pleasure; and as she<br>
has been remarkably successful, and sti11<br>
remains a favourite piece for the enjoy-<br>
ment of her charms, and the conversa-<br>
tional intercourse, with a temper remark-<br>
ably good, for a whole night she ex-<br>
pects five pounds five shillings.<br>
