 Soho_.<br>
<br>
 Si javois pour heritage,<br>
 Le tresor le plus charmant,<br>
 je vous en donnerois en gage,<br>
 Et mon coeur pour un present.<br>
<br>
 It is only six months that this lady has<br>
left her native country, and at present<br>
speaks very little English. She is young<br>
and lively, (but still does not seem to<br>
possess so much vivacity as the majority<br>
of her countrywomen;) she loves to<br>
revenge her countrymen's cause on the<br>
English, by doing what the most valor-<br>
ous Frenchman would never effect, that<br>
is, to bring Britons on their knees; she<br>
is now about twenty two, rather short<br>
and fat, with a plump face, and such a<br>
roguish lear in her eye, that cannot be<br>
resisted. Several of our brave officers<br>
have spent some of their _best blood_ in her<br>
service, and regretted they had no more<br>
to _shed_. Her lovely dark hair seems like<br>
a net to catch lovers, and her lower tend-<br>
rils, which sport on her alabaster mount<br>
of Venus, are formed to give delight. She<br>
has one qualification which many English<br>
girls want, which is a certain cleanliness<br>
in the Netherlands. They are contented<br>
to wash their faces, necks, and hands;<br>
but Mademoiselle, like many of her<br>
countrywomen, thinks that not enough;<br>
she performs constant ablutions on the<br>
gulph of pleasure, and keeps it constantly<br>
fresh, cool, and clean, never putting<br>
a morsel into that mouth, till she has<br>
fully absterged every possible remnant of<br>
the last meal. She constantly mounts<br>
her _bidet_, and with a large sponge laves<br>
the whole extent of the parish of the<br>
mother of all saints. Some may, perhaps,<br>
think her a female spy, or a smuggler;<br>
but surely a girl, who so freely discloses<br>
her own secrets, can have no improper<br>
aim at those of government; and her<br>
commodity cannot be pronounced as<br>
contraband when it hath so often been<br>
duly entered.<br>
<br>
She dresses quite in the French stile<br>
and taste, lays on a profusion of rouge<br>
and pearl powder, and is not particularly<br>
partial to money, but will condescend to<br>
take a couple of guineas, _not as payment,<br>
but solely as 'une gage d'amour_.<br>
