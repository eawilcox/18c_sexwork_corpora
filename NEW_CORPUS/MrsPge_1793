<body>Mrs. P&mdash;ge, No. 26, Upper Newman-street.<br>
<br>
Come, thou Goddess, fair and free, <br>
With the sweet simplicity.<br>
<br>
The above two lines are highly descriptive of Mrs. P&mdash;, who for ease, <br>
freedom and simplicity is scarcely to be matched among the whole <br>
sisterhood, besides which, her beauty is by no means inconsiderable. <br>
She is about twenty, has been near five years in business, and has <br>
had tolerable fortune; her features are good, except her mouth, which <br>
is a little too wide, especially when she laughs, which is pretty <br>
often. Those who are inclined to mirth, will find her to be a good <br>
companion, without the least tincture of blasphemy, she is not of a <br>
mercenary disposition, yet she expects one pound one, but rather than <br>
lose a customer will put up with half the sum.<br>
