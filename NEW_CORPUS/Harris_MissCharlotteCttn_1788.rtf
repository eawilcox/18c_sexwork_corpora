 street, Soho_.<br>
<br>
 ----------The self same cates<br>
 Still offer'd, soon the appetite offend;<br>
 The most delicious soonest.<br>
<br>
How happy would it be for the author<br>
of this anniversary publication, could he<br>
procure a friend to new christen the fea-<br>
tures, that the reader might with less fa-<br>
tigue go through this heap of tautology,<br>
but as that end is not yet accomplished,<br>
we must steer according to the old line,<br>
<br>
An eye must still be an eye, and a tooth a tooth;<br>
<br>
both of which our young Venus, who has<br>
just reached her seventeenth year, pos-<br>
sesses in a superlative degree. She strong-<br>
ly points to your imagination a casket of<br>
orient pearls, the former of two living dia-<br>
monds, whose language so forcibly invite<br>
thq blind boy to the happy cloyster, that<br>
there is seldom many fleeting moments<br>
before an almost involuntary attack must<br>
be made. Her heaving breasts foretell<br>
the _Coming_ joy; the _liquid eye_ declares it<br>
nearer still; the _interrupted sigh_, the sud-<br>
den _gush_, if premature and _involuntary twist_<br>
of the limbs speaks a _flowing_ of the _tide_,<br>
and the critical oh! bids the silly pen<br>
defiance to express. She is of a good size,<br>
and well form'd, of a lively and sweet<br>
disposition, has been but a short time in<br>
life, and has beautiful dark hair;<br>
<br>
 Her eye brows arch'd, and rather full than<br>
 thin,<br>
 To shade the dazzling light that dwells within.<br>
<br>
She has met with many admirers but<br>
showing lately too great a partiality for<br>
the gentleman whose name she assumes,<br>
( a horse jockey) she has lately sunk a<br>
little in the world; his late inconstancy,<br>
however, has wrought so powerfully upon<br>
her, that she is now soliciting the fa-<br>
vours and support of her old friends; she<br>
is of a good size, and well made, of a<br>
lively and sweet disposition, loves a glass<br>
of Madeira, but never takes a glass in<br>
one hand without having prudence in<br>
the other, and is particularly careful that<br>
the effects of Bacchus shall not prevent<br>
the more sensible joys, of Venus. Two<br>
pounds two shillings is her price to stran-<br>
gers, but if a very old and good, acquain-<br>
tance, she will not refuse half the sum.<br>
