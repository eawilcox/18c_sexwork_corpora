<body>Miss Godf&mdash;y, No. 22, Upper Newman-street.<br>
<br>
If parts can conquer great and small, <br>
Sure &mdash; and Godf&mdash;y must needs do all.<br>
<br>
This lady is a kind of boatswain in her way, and when she speaks, <br>
every word is uttered with a thundering and vociferous tone. She is a <br>
fine lively little girl, about twenty-two, very fond of dancing, has <br>
dark eyes and hair, well shaped, and an exceeding good bed-fellow, <br>
will take brandy with any one, or drink and swear, and though but <br>
little, will fight a good battle. We apprehend this lady would be an <br>
extraordinary good companion for an officer in the army, as she might <br>
save him the trouble of giving the word of command.<br>
<br>
She resides in the first floor.<br>
