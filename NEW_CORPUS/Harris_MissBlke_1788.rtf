 Oxford Road_.<br>
<br>
 The soft desiring girl expects thy coming;<br>
 Busy in thought, and hasty for the hour,<br>
 She turns and sighs, and wishes, counts the<br>
 clock,<br>
 And every minute drags a heavy pace,<br>
 Till thou appear, the champion of the bed,<br>
 Arm'd at all points, and eager for the charge<br>
 That calls thee to the combat of thy love.<br>
<br>
 This lady's graceful figure, beautiful<br>
face, dark hair, and ivory teeth, must<br>
surely win the heart of every one, who<br>
is fortunate enough to get into her com-<br>
pany, and make you pant for the en-<br>
joyment of the more essential bliss; for<br>
the performance of which, who indeed,<br>
is better qualified? who is of a sweeter<br>
temper? who can better twine in the en-<br>
chanting folds of love? who can fill the<br>
night with stranger raptures? few, if<br>
any. Inslead of expecting two guineas<br>
for the performance, we may rather<br>
wonder at her moderation in not ex-<br>
pecting more: and though she is per-<br>
fectly charming when drest, yet we are<br>
informed that her naked beauties are still<br>
more enchanting; her lovely demi<br>
globes of delight, with their ruby buds,<br>
ravish the wondering eye. Descend still<br>
lower to the _regions of happiness_, the _true<br>
country of pleasure_, and there appear the<br>
_flaxen tendrils_ wantonly playing over the<br>
_mother of all saints_, whilst the _pouting<br>
protuberances_ leave it doubtful which _lips_<br>
better deserve the burning kiss; the ex-<br>
tatic embrace both act in concert, and<br>
charm with delightful unison; whilst<br>
those _above_ murmur the transports of the<br>
soul, those which are placed _below_, per-<br>
form the delicious suction, which cannot<br>
be resisted till every atom of the genial<br>
juice is drawn through its most natural<br>
vent--that the man blest with enjoy-<br>
ment, may cry out with Lee in his<br>
_Caesar Borgia_,<br>
<br>
<br>
 ---------O thou great chemise, nature,<br>
 Who draw'st one spirit so divinely perfect,<br>
 Thou mak'st a dreg of all the world beside.<br>
<br>
 Ireland lays claim to the honour of<br>
giving birth to this charming girl, who<br>
has not sported her figure in public<br>
life more than ten months; indeed her<br>
particular friend, the Captain, whose<br>
name she has taken the liberty of<br>
assuming, thinks her rather more honest<br>
than we believe her to be; she is now<br>
in her eighteenth year, dances well,<br>
and is fond of frequenting public hops,<br>
where, if her partner pleases her, for<br>
two guineas she has no objection to<br>
take him home, and return the com-<br>
pliment, that is, provided the Captain,<br>
is from town.<br>
