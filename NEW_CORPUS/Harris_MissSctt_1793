<body>Miss Sc&mdash;tt, No. 44, Margaret-street, Cavendish-square.<br>
<br>
'Ads bobs she's wondrous pretty! <br>
Her looks are almost jetty; <br>
She's a finer wench than Betty, <br>
And lo! her eyes are blue!<br>
<br>
We cannot call this lady a beauty of the first rate; She is what may <br>
be determined pretty, but nothing extraordinary, and tho' she cannot <br>
boast of all those external graces, which distinguish the beauties of <br>
some ladies; yet I've heard, when she is engaged in her business, <br>
there are very few who are her superiors. She is amorous to the <br>
greatest degree, and has courage enough not to be afraid of the <br>
largest and the strongest man that ever drew weapon in the cause of <br>
love. She has had a number of admirers in her time, all of which she <br>
had the satisfaction of pleasing during their temporary residence <br>
with her. She is now in keeping by one Mr. B&mdash;, who is not a little <br>
enamoured of her. Her person is of the middling fine, little black <br>
eyes, black hair, very fine teeth, and is altogether very agreeable.<br>
