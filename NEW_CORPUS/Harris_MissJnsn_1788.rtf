 Charlotte Street_.<br>
<br>
 And all these joys insatiably to prove,<br>
 With which rich beauty feasts the glutton love.<br>
<br>
The raven coloured tresses of Miss<br>
J--ns--n are pleasing, and are charac-<br>
teristics of strength and ability in the<br>
wars of Venus. Indeed this fair one is<br>
not afraid of work, but will undergo a<br>
great deal of labour in the action; she<br>
sings, dances, will drink a chearful glass,<br>
and is a good companion. She has such<br>
a noble elasticity in her loins, that she can<br>
cast her lover to a pleasing height, and<br>
receive him again with the utmost dex-<br>
terity. Her price is one pound one, and<br>
for her person and amorous qualifications<br>
she is well worth the money.</font></span></font></body>
