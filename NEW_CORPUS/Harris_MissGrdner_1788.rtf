 Oxford street_.<br>
<br>
 She thrust among the bushes her fair hand,<br>
 To draw the plant; and every plant she drew,<br>
 She shook the stalk, and brushed away the dew.<br>
<br>
 This lady's character answers exceed-<br>
ingly well to her name, being exquisitely<br>
well skilled in the art of _raising_ plants in<br>
a _hot-bed_; this she practices on her own<br>
_bottom_, but still wishes for a partner to be<br>
concerned in the business. Her person is<br>
pleasing, she has the roses in her cheeks,<br>
encircled with beds of never fading lilys;<br>
is as strait as a pine of two years growth,<br>
though not quite so tall; her locks shine<br>
like black maiden hair, and she is as full<br>
of juice as a _ripe amber goose-berry_; she<br>
takes a guinea to be _engrafted_ upon, and<br>
is a very agreeable sprig of _hare-hound_.<br>
She is much esteemed by the lovers of<br>
_planting_, for having a beautiful show of<br>
_navel-wort_, and her fondness for _rampions_<br>
and _amber vitae_, she despises _fool-stones_,<br>
_cuckow pintle_, _Jews ears_, or _birch_; but<br>
particularly likes _Adam's Apple-tree_, _sensi-<br>
tive plant_, _stich-wort_, _nutmegs_, and such<br>
valuable productions. To all such she is<br>
free, for her _lips_ opens her _lady's mantle_,<br>
encloses them in her _convolvulus_, pours<br>
down a whole volley of _seed_, and never<br>
quits them whilst they have a _drop_ of _sap_.<br>
