<body>Mrs. Bi&mdash;d, No, 27, Salisbury-street, Strand.<br>
<br>
For 'tis in vain to guess <br>
At women by appearances; <br>
They paint and patch their imperfections <br>
Of intellectual complexions, <br>
And daub their tempers o'er with washes, <br>
As artificial as their faces.<br>
<br>
Those who keep ladies do not seem to regard their charms, but become <br>
keepers because it is the fashion. But she cannot be admired on <br>
account of her charms, for she has very few; indeed we are so blind <br>
that we cannot discern any. She is tall and lusty, has a dead eye and <br>
flattish nose, and good teeth, and is very much given to laughing, <br>
she wears short petticoats. We do not know whether her favours are <br>
bestowed for money or love, but this we are certain of, that C&mdash; H&mdash; is <br>
not the only man who experiences the happiness of her voluptuous <br>
favours, which are very numerous.</body>
