 stock-row_.<br>
<br>
 In framing thee, heav'n took unusual care,<br>
 And stampt thee fairest of the _Cretan_ fair.<br>
<br>
 There is something so very engaging<br>
in the person of this lady, that those gen-<br>
tlemen, who once visit her, seldom or<br>
ever fail repeating it. In her deportment<br>
she is free and open, without the least<br>
tinge of affectation, in size rather below<br>
mediocrity, fine dark hair, and bewitch-<br>
ing black eyes; a complexion between<br>
the fair and brunette: her features are<br>
remarkably delicate, and, conjunctively<br>
taken, fully verifies the Poet.<br>
<br>
 None can observe her features but approve,<br>
 There's grace with beauty, dignity with love.<br>
<br>
Her breasts are finely proportioned, and<br>
delicately moulded for love's tender attack,<br>
and swell and recede the melting lan-<br>
guage of the heart; the _grove beneath_,<br>
delicately shaded by a _sable thicket_, is<br>
fraught with all its proper sensibility,<br>
and, well knowing the value of her charms,<br>
she is not one that can be sported with,<br>
not will she suffer any liberty beyond the<br>
strictest bounds of decency to take place,<br>
without the payment of one piece before<br>
hand.<br>
