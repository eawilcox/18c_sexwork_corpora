 Oxford-Road_.<br>
<br>
 Oh, pleasing talk, to paint the ripen'd charms<br>
 Of youth untutor'd in the female arts;<br>
 To see instinctively desire blaze out,<br>
 And warm the mind with all its burning joys.<br>
 The _tell-tale eyes_ in liquid pools sustain'd,<br>
 The throbbing breast now rising, now suppress't;<br>
 The _thrilling bliss_ quick darting thro' the frame,<br>
 The _short fetch'd sighs_, the snow white twining<br>
 limbs,<br>
 The sudden gush, and the extatic oh.<br>
<br>
SUCH our all pleasing L--st--r<br>
leads the train, and, smiling like<br>
the morn, unfolds her heaven of beauties.<br>
Oh, for a _Guido's touch_, or _Thomson's<br>
 thought_,<br>
<br>
 ( 16 )<br>
<br>
thought_, to paint the richness of her<br>
unequall'd charms; every perfection<br>
that can possibly adorn the face and<br>
mind of Woman seem centered in this be-<br>
witching girl; hither resort then, ye<br>
genuine lovers of beauty and good<br>
sense; here, whilst _Plutus_ reigns, may<br>
you revel nor know satiety; here feast<br>
the longing appetite, and return with<br>
fresh _vigor_ to every _attack_. Now arrived<br>
at the tempting age of nineteen, her ima-<br>
gination is filled with every luscious<br>
idea, _refined_ sensibiiity, and _fierce desire_<br>
can unite, her form is majestic, tall, and<br>
elegant; her make truly genteel, her<br>
complexion<br>
<br>
 -----As April's lily fair,<br>
 And blooming as June's brightest rose.<br>
<br>
Painted by the masterly hand of nature,<br>
shaded by tresses of the darkest brown,<br>
and enlivened by two stars that swim in<br>
all the essence of unsatiated love.<br>
<br>
 Her pouting lips distil nectarious balm,<br>
 And thro' the frame its thrilling transports<br>
 dart;<br>
<br>
which, when parted, display a casket<br>
of snow white pearls, ranged in the nicest<br>
regularity, the _neighbouring hills_ below<br>
 full<br>
<br>
 ( 71 )<br>
<br>
full ripe for manual pressure, firm, and<br>
elastic, and heave at every touch. The<br>
_Elysian font_, in the centre of a _black be-<br>
witching grove_, supported by two pyra-<br>
mids white as alabaster, very delicate,<br>
and soft as turtle's down. At the _approach_<br>
of their _favourite lord_ unfold, and for<br>
three guineas he is conducted to this<br>
_harbour_ of never failing delight. Add<br>
to all this, she sings well, is a very<br>
chearful companion, and has only been,<br>
in _life_ nine months.</font></span></font></body>
