 Market-Lane, near the Opera House_.<br>
<br>
 In the middle of me,<br>
 You plainly may see,<br>
 A thing that will suit every man;<br>
 And when you are in it,<br>
 The critical minute,<br>
 Ensure as fast as you can.<br>
<br>
A young tit of Mother Gr--y's own<br>
procuring, and that our reader should<br>
not mistake the old abbess, we will give<br>
a short description of her. If you chance<br>
to visit her in the morning, the smell of<br>
yellow usquebaugh will salute your nos-<br>
trils, of which she takes copious draughts<br>
before breakfast. In all her actions she<br>
shews the lewdness of a monkey, and<br>
the letchery of a goat; she has lately<br>
been _fired_ by P----, the French fri-<br>
zeur, but knowing the use of murcury,<br>
she applied it in such a manner that she<br>
procured an effectual salivation, and<br>
enabled her to take into her house the<br>
fame squinting gentleman that present<br>
acts as her _fine man_; she boasts of her<br>
knowledge of great men, and there is<br>
scarce a lord or duke in the land that<br>
has not been her _cull_.<br>
We can but pity our little girl in<br>
question for being so unhappily situated;<br>
she is a charming sprightly lass, and so<br>
fond of kissing, and so perfect a mistress<br>
in the art, that she will frequently force<br>
nature to a dissolving pitch, before the<br>
_right parts_ come in proper contract; her<br>
liveliness of disposition, and activity in<br>
the sports of Venus, make her so desi-<br>
rable a bed-fellow, that her magic _ring_<br>
is as much sought after as the philoso-<br>
pher's stone; has good hair and teeth, a<br>
plump round, firm breast, and confined<br>
merely as an object to sensual desire, pos-<br>
sesses every qualification a sensualift can<br>
desire. She is to be met with every<br>
night at Sterling's, and being newly come<br>
on to the town, and possessing too much<br>
innocence, as well as ignorance, to fight<br>
the world as she ought, she is frequently<br>
bilked; but this there is no doubt she<br>
will soon get the better off, particularly<br>
if she follows the precepts and advice of<br>
the old lady she lives with.</font></span></font></body>
