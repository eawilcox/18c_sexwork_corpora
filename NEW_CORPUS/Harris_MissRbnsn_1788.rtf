 Leciester Fields.<br>
<br>
 Thou can'st not see one wrinkle in my brow,<br>
 My eyes tho' dark, are bright and quick in<br>
 turning,<br>
 My beauty as the spring does yearly grow,<br>
 My flesh is soft and plump; my marrow<br>
 burning.<br>
<br>
 It is not surprising, the notice which<br>
a lady, who as long _erected_ her standard<br>
in the _field_ of _pleasure_, attracts from the<br>
veterans in the same field. This is the case<br>
of our heroine, now about twenty-eight<br>
years of age, tall, rather lusty, and a<br>
figure that speaks true symmetry; hand-<br>
some, a slight tinge of the brunette in<br>
her complexion, with very fine dark hair,<br>
fine hazel eyes, very dark, and finely<br>
arch'd eye brows; indeed, she has been<br>
a very fine woman, and is far from being<br>
in her wane of beauty; her hair, indeed,<br>
is remarkably fine, and such a length, as<br>
to be able to be interwoven with her _once<br>
maidenhead thicket_, now grown to a _fine<br>
bushy arbour_ surrounding the _blissful cell_ of<br>
the blind sovereign of wanton sports,<br>
where he reigns predominant over every<br>
sense, and subjects all the rest to that of<br>
feeling; here he keeps his court and holds<br>
his revels; come then ye followers of Co-<br>
mus, plunge your burning _plough shares_<br>
within the betwiching circle, and slake<br>
the hot breathing of untamed desire; here<br>
dance the round of joy till sense grows<br>
giddy in the maze, and taste the delicious<br>
transports of maddening delight, till _pan-<br>
ting nature striking the alarm_, proclaims a<br>
_dying pause_ to her own music, and _pours_<br>
forth the _flood_ of mingled rapture; she has<br>
good breasts, and her limbs are finely<br>
turn'd and proportioned; she is of a very<br>
good disposition, and a most agreeable<br>
companion, and is at present in keep-<br>
ing by a Mr. M--lls; but being fond of<br>
the _glow_ of youth, and the manly embrace<br>
of full vigour, she indulges variety, and<br>
is various in her expectation for so doing.</font></span></font></body>
