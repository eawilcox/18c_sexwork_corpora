<br>
 Dieux; qu'a t-il vu, que d'appas enchanteurs!<br>
 Sous un bosquet, d'ou coule une fountaine,<br>
 Ou chaque mois le doux printemps ramene;<br>
 Pour nos plaisirs, l'abondance &amp; les fleurs,<br>
 It voit un trou, le joli precipice;<br>
 Ce n'etact point le trou de saint Patrice.<br>
<br>
 This lady has lately been a teacher in a<br>
French boarding fchool, but taking a li-<br>
king to a young Clergyman in the neigh-<br>
bourhood, she made a conjunction of<br>
calvanism with the established church,<br>
and he propagated the gospel in her _fo-<br>
reign parts_ with great assiduity; but her<br>
immoderate love of the sport, after<br>
having once tasted the power of the _Bri-<br>
tish constitution_, speedily brought her to<br>
our market, here to her great discredit<br>
and loss she has form'd a connection<br>
with a boy by the name of N--wb--y,<br>
brother to the noted attorney well known<br>
as a flash man among the ladies, and one<br>
whose principles will not bear the strictest<br>
scrutiny. She is a tall, genteel looking<br>
figure, speaks English pretty well, fine<br>
dark eyes and hair, a tolerable complex-<br>
ion, thanks to Mr. Warren, who oc-<br>
casionally fills up those indentions the<br>
small pox has been busy in making, and<br>
makes her a desirable piece enough.<br>
Her low countries are said to be of am-<br>
ple dimensions, and she is so publick spir-<br>
ited, that she makes no distinction of<br>
persons or nations; but will say, _je vous<br>
remercie_, to any man for the smallest<br>
piece of gold.</font></span></font></body>
