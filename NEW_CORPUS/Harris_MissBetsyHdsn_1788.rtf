 Duke-Street, Saint James's_.<br>
<br>
 How dull the spring of life would prove,<br>
 Without the kiss that waits on love;<br>
 From youthful lips you soon receive<br>
 The richest harvest lips can give.<br>
<br>
 Eloped from her friends in the country<br>
but a short time, flushed with all the<br>
amorous fire of youth insatiate, and ripe<br>
with every personal charm the heart of<br>
man can wish, this pleasing girl enters<br>
our list. The fresh country bloom still<br>
remains unimpaired, the rural vivacity is<br>
still the same, and united with a beauti-<br>
ful skin and complexion, we can present<br>
our readers with a temper and disposition<br>
that good nature and affability must call<br>
their own. Her teeth are regular, and<br>
very white, her eyes of the most lively<br>
hazel, which, without the least fire from<br>
Bacchus, shoot the most powerful glances;<br>
her hair a lovely brown, her breasts are<br>
small and never have been sufficiently<br>
subjected to manual pressure to deprive<br>
them of their natural firmness; she is<br>
willingly compliant to any liberty in<br>
company, that does not extend beyond<br>
the bounds of decency; but let nature<br>
come forth _unadorned_, get once the<br>
enchanting girl in bed, she _opens_ all her<br>
charms, and gives a sudden loose to such<br>
a bent of amorous passion, she would fire<br>
the most torpid dispolition; when once<br>
you press her in your eager arms the<br>
game must instantly begin, and scarcely<br>
does she allow an introductory kiss, so<br>
uncurbed is her appetite, and so fond is<br>
she of _repetition_, that she would with<br>
every lover that passes a night with her<br>
to be able to say with Ovid,<br>
<br>
 Fair Betsy knows, when numbering the delight<br>
 Not less than _nine_ full tranfports crown'd the<br>
 night.<br>
<br>
Only six months has this child of love<br>
dealed out her charms in public, but well<br>
knowing their value, is not quite satisfied<br>
if she does not receive on _paper_ a proof<br>
of their excellence.</font></span></font></body>
