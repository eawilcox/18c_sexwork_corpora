 Rathbone Place_.<br>
<br>
 Hope, with a gaudy prospect feeds the eye,<br>
 Sooths every sense, does with each with<br>
 comply;<br>
 But false enjoyment the kind guide destroys,<br>
 We lose the passion in the treacherous joys.<br>
<br>
 Enjoyment is the most exquisite of<br>
human pleasures; ah! what a pity it is<br>
so short in duration. Nature wound up<br>
to the highest pitch, after striking _twelve_,<br>
immediately descends to poor solitary<br>
_one_: these are the reflections that na-<br>
turally arise on enjoying Betsy. Though<br>
she is but little, she is an epitome of de-<br>
light, a quintescence of joy, which by the<br>
most endearing chemistry, give all spirit,<br>
and unite in small compass, the efficacy<br>
of a much larger bulk. Her lovely fair<br>
tresses and elegant countenance beat<br>
alarms to love; but we attack only to<br>
fall in the breach, and lament that the<br>
luscious conflict is so soon ended. The<br>
common destroyer of beauty has made a<br>
few dells on the face of this fair Jewess,<br>
but a pair of pretty dimples makes ample<br>
amends, and quite over balances these<br>
trifling imperfections; she has been in<br>
life not more than six months, and ex-<br>
pects, if she calls any man a friend,<br>
to receive two guineas the first visit.<br>
