 Middlesex-Hospital_.<br>
<br>
 Give me a nymph with all her charms,<br>
 A full grown nymph to fill my arms;<br>
 And leave to them that cannot feel,<br>
 The insipid things they call genteel.<br>
<br>
Strange it is, but not less strange than<br>
true, that Englishmen in general have a<br>
great itch for variety; and according to<br>
our promissary note in the preface, we<br>
here present them with one of the finest,<br>
fattest figures as fully finished for fun<br>
and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed;<br>
fraught with every melting charm that<br>
can be found in the field of Venus, for-<br>
tunate for the true lovers of fat, should<br>
fate throw them into the possession of<br>
such full grown. beauties. Can you<br>
conceive the lightest tints of an Italian<br>
sky? Such then her melting eye; can<br>
you figure to your imagination the swel-<br>
ling ripeness of two tempting cherries?<br>
such then her lips; though some might<br>
be led to imagine if they were a size less,<br>
they would be full as tempting. Can you<br>
place before your eyes, two beds of down<br>
for Cupids to sport on? Such then her<br>
breasts. Would you wish for an _ambush_,<br>
for some of their more wanton brothers<br>
to play at _hide_ and _seek_ in? Show them<br>
her Cyprian mounts. Have you a desire<br>
to roll in the loose luscious lap of lip-<br>
inviting luxury? _Spend_ an hour in her<br>
arms; that is, if Mr. C--tt--n should<br>
not be there first; he being so great a<br>
favourite, she is always denied when in<br>
his company. If not at home, she is to<br>
be found at any of the public hops, and<br>
in general with her favourite man, who<br>
we are told, won her first by virtue of his<br>
fiddle-stick, and has, since her first attach-<br>
ment, kept her in very good tune; if any<br>
of our readers wishes to try a tune with<br>
her, _he_ must pay for it; but she is not at<br>
all exorbitant in her demands, seldom<br>
wishing to turn money away.<br>
