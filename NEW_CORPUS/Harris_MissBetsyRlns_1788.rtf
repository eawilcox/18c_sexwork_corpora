<body>Miss Betsy R--l--ns, No. 12, _Little<br>
 Tichfield Street_.<br>
<br>
 Just at fifteen the _down_ of nature grew,<br>
 O'er the soft yielding _lips_ of crimson hue;<br>
 The wanton fire of love began to play,<br>
 And on her bosom shew its powerful sway<br>
 When two more years had ripened every joint,<br>
 All nature's power did to the _centre_ point,<br>
<br>
 And still continues to point there,<br>
never seeking for a more engaging part,<br>
than that whose natural instinct so forcibly<br>
point to that _central_ abode; and well<br>
may it point there, for she can command<br>
a Paradise of bliss; a fair eye, and<br>
beautiful complexion, together with<br>
firm panting breasts, busy hand, which<br>
loves to be busily employed in inviting the<br>
tumid guest to her dear land of delight;<br>
the two grand supporters of which always<br>
unfold at the approach of this never un-<br>
welcome visitor, whose _knocking_ and<br>
entrance is generally performed at the<br>
same time; the _dando_ and _reddendo_ game<br>
soon began, which cannot be won but by<br>
death. She is tall and genteelly formed,good teeth, a fair skin, and pretty<br>
melting light eyes, and was taught,<br>
when in keeping by the surgeon sh takes<br>
her name from, that kind of behaviour<br>
that does credit to herself, and is very<br>
rare to be met with amongst the frail<br>
daughters of pleasure.<br>
