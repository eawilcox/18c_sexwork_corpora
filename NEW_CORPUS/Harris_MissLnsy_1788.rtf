 Berwick Street_.<br>
<br>
 Close in the arms she languishingly lies,<br>
 With dying looks, short breath, and swimming<br>
 eyes.<br>
<br>
To all lovers of carrots we would re-<br>
commend this fair complex, and blue ey'd<br>
nymph; she is now steering into the<br>
nineteenth year, and has very little of the<br>
vulgarity too often found in the sister-<br>
hood, but would be rather silent than<br>
speak nonsense: the mere sensualist will<br>
not find her quite to his fancy, but she<br>
will please the delicate and sensible, who can<br>
spend the dull pause of joy with her<br>
agreeably, till call'd by nature to repeti-<br>
tion; in which, as well as in conservation,<br>
we are informed she is equally charming.</font></span></font></body>
