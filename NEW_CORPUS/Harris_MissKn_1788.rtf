<br>
 &quot;Let _Nature_ empty her whole quiver in me,<br>
 &quot;I have a _part_, which, like an ample shield,<br>
 Can _take in all_, and yet leave room for more.<br>
<br>
 This lady assumed the name, she at<br>
present goes by, from motives of con-<br>
cealment in her _sportive_ profession, in<br>
which the drives a good trade, and is<br>
very much lik'd by the _beaux esprits_ of<br>
the age for her _spunk_, being remarkably<br>
full of Cyprian Spirit, many degrees<br>
above any proof it has ever been put to;<br>
so that for the power of her parts, and<br>
active ability, she could match Turk<br>
Gregory; and when she had him in her<br>
tenacious arms, he might perform the<br>
amorous feat within the _magic circle_ of her<br>
charms, till even strength, like his, was<br>
_spent_, and nature quite exhausted of all<br>
her balmy store, whilst she, untired, and<br>
springing from the bed, would ask a fresh<br>
attack, and still give pleasure in the warm<br>
embrace; she is of a dark complexion,<br>
with a wide mouth, and extraordinary<br>
well formed for a winter's companion.<br>
She has no pretensions to beauty, but<br>
founds her claims to public favour on in-<br>
ternal merit, and her _capacity_ and skill in<br>
the rites of Venus, appealing rather to<br>
the sense of touch, than that of sight; she<br>
is in general to be met with at a favourite<br>
hop, at the west end of the town, and if<br>
Mr. B--rd should not be there, you may<br>
gain the liberty of attending her home,<br>
and the will thank you for half a guinea.<br>
