 Street, Oxford-Road_.<br>
<br>
 Wine whets the wit, improves its native force,<br>
 And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse.<br>
<br>
 This is fully verified in Mrs. S. who<br>
is never so good a companion as when a<br>
_little_ enlivened with the juice of the grape<br>
but, always guided by prudence and dis-<br>
cretion, she never goes so far as to render<br>
herself the least unpleasant. Her figure<br>
is tall, elegant and stately.<br>
<br>
 Her full orb'd chest lie open to the gale,<br>
 And teach the lily whiteness in the vale.<br>
<br>
Her legs and feet are particularly neat<br>
and clean; she sings a good song, is a<br>
very good friend to mirth and good hu-<br>
mour, and always steers clear of vulga-<br>
rity. She is now in her twentieth year,<br>
possessed of every charm that encourag-<br>
ing. age can boast, and but a very few<br>
months has left Hampshire; we therefore<br>
think two guineas bestowed upon her<br>
cannot be regretted.</font></span></font></body>
