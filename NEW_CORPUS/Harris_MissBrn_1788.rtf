 Street, Soho_.<br>
<br>
 Close in the arms she languishingly lies,<br>
 With dying looks, short breath, and wishing<br>
 eyes.<br>
<br>
This accomplished nymph has just<br>
attained her eighteenth year, and fraught<br>
with every perfection, enters a volunteer<br>
in the field of Venus. She plays on the<br>
piano forte, sings, dances, and is mistress<br>
of every _Manoeuvre_ in the amorous contest<br>
that can enhance the coming pleasure;<br>
is of the middle stature, fine auburn<br>
hair, dark eyes, and very inviting<br>
countenance, which ever seems to beam<br>
delight and love. In bed she is all the<br>
heart can wish, or eye admire, every<br>
limb is symmetry, every action under<br>
cover truly amorous; her price is two<br>
pounds two.</font></span></font></body>
