<br>
THE AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE<br>
<br>
<br>
The world is so taken up of late with novels and romances, that it will<br>
be hard for a private history to be taken for genuine, where the names<br>
and other circumstances of the person are concealed, and on this<br>
account we must be content to leave the reader to pass his own opinion<br>
upon the ensuing sheet, and take it just as he pleases.<br>
<br>
The author is here supposed to be writing her own history, and in the<br>
very beginning of her account she gives the reasons why she thinks fit<br>
to conceal her true name, after which there is no occasion to say any<br>
more about that.<br>
<br>
It is true that the original of this story is put into new words, and<br>
the style of the famous lady we here speak of is a little altered;<br>
particularly she is made to tell her own tale in modester words that<br>
she told it at first, the copy which came first to hand having been<br>
written in language more like one still in Newgate than one grown<br>
penitent and humble, as she afterwards pretends to be.<br>
<br>
The pen employed in finishing her story, and making it what you now see<br>
it to be, has had no little difficulty to put it into a dress fit to be<br>
seen, and to make it speak language fit to be read. When a woman<br>
debauched from her youth, nay, even being the offspring of debauchery<br>
and vice, comes to give an account of all her vicious practices, and<br>
even to descend to the particular occasions and circumstances by which<br>
she ran through in threescore years, an author must be hard put to it<br>
wrap it up so clean as not to give room, especially for vicious<br>
readers, to turn it to his disadvantage.<br>
<br>
All possible care, however, has been taken to give no lewd ideas, no<br>
immodest turns in the new dressing up of this story; no, not to the<br>
worst parts of her expressions. To this purpose some of the vicious<br>
part of her life, which could not be modestly told, is quite left out,<br>
and several other parts are very much shortened. What is left &rsquo;tis<br>
hoped will not offend the chastest reader or the modest hearer; and as<br>
the best use is made even of the worst story, the moral &rsquo;tis hoped will<br>
keep the reader serious, even where the story might incline him to be<br>
otherwise. To give the history of a wicked life repented of,<br>
necessarily requires that the wicked part should be make as wicked as<br>
the real history of it will bear, to illustrate and give a beauty to<br>
the penitent part, which is certainly the best and brightest, if<br>
related with equal spirit and life.<br>
<br>
It is suggested there cannot be the same life, the same brightness and<br>
beauty, in relating the penitent part as is in the criminal part. If<br>
there is any truth in that suggestion, I must be allowed to say &rsquo;tis<br>
because there is not the same taste and relish in the reading, and<br>
indeed it is too true that the difference lies not in the real worth of<br>
the subject so much as in the gust and palate of the reader.<br>
<br>
But as this work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to read<br>
it, and how to make the good uses of it which the story all along<br>
recommends to them, so it is to be hoped that such readers will be more<br>
pleased with the moral than the fable, with the application than with<br>
the relation, and with the end of the writer than with the life of the<br>
person written of.<br>
<br>
There is in this story abundance of delightful incidents, and all of<br>
them usefully applied. There is an agreeable turn artfully given them<br>
in the relating, that naturally instructs the reader, either one way or<br>
other. The first part of her lewd life with the young gentleman at<br>
Colchester has so many happy turns given it to expose the crime, and<br>
warn all whose circumstances are adapted to it, of the ruinous end of<br>
such things, and the foolish, thoughtless, and abhorred conduct of both<br>
the parties, that it abundantly atones for all the lively description<br>
she gives of her folly and wickedness.<br>
<br>
The repentance of her lover at the Bath, and how brought by the just<br>
alarm of his fit of sickness to abandon her; the just caution given<br>
there against even the lawful intimacies of the dearest friends, and<br>
how unable they are to preserve the most solemn resolutions of virtue<br>
without divine assistance; these are parts which, to a just<br>
discernment, will appear to have more real beauty in them, than all the<br>
amorous chain of story which introduces it.<br>
<br>
In a word, as the whole relation is carefully garbled of all the levity<br>
and looseness that was in it, so it all applied, and with the utmost<br>
care, to virtuous and religious uses. None can, without being guilty of<br>
manifest injustice, cast any reproach upon it, or upon our design in<br>
publishing it.<br>
<br>
The advocates for the stage have, in all ages, made this the great<br>
argument to persuade people that their plays are useful, and that they<br>
ought to be allowed in the most civilised and in the most religious<br>
government; namely, that they are applied to virtuous purposes, and<br>
that by the most lively representations, they fail not to recommend<br>
virtue and generous principles, and to discourage and expose all sorts<br>
of vice and corruption of manners; and were it true that they did so,<br>
and that they constantly adhered to that rule, as the test of their<br>
acting on the theatre, much might be said in their favour.<br>
<br>
Throughout the infinite variety of this book, this fundamental is most<br>
strictly adhered to; there is not a wicked action in any part of it,<br>
but is first and last rendered unhappy and unfortunate; there is not a<br>
superlative villain brought upon the stage, but either he is brought to<br>
an unhappy end, or brought to be a penitent; there is not an ill thing<br>
mentioned but it is condemned, even in the relation, nor a virtuous,<br>
just thing but it carries its praise along with it. What can more<br>
exactly answer the rule laid down, to recommend even those<br>
representations of things which have so many other just objections<br>
leaving against them? namely, of example, of bad company, obscene<br>
language, and the like.<br>
<br>
Upon this foundation this book is recommended to the reader as a work<br>
from every part of which something may be learned, and some just and<br>
religious inference is drawn, by which the reader will have something<br>
of instruction, if he pleases to make use of it.<br>
<br>
All the exploits of this lady of fame, in her depredations upon<br>
mankind, stand as so many warnings to honest people to beware of them,<br>
intimating to them by what methods innocent people are drawn in,<br>
plundered and robbed, and by consequence how to avoid them. Her robbing<br>
a little innocent child, dressed fine by the vanity of the mother, to<br>
go to the dancing-school, is a good memento to such people hereafter,<br>
as is likewise her picking the gold watch from the young lady&rsquo;s side in<br>
the Park.<br>
<br>
Her getting a parcel from a hare-brained wench at the coaches in St.<br>
John Street; her booty made at the fire, and again at Harwich, all give<br>
us excellent warnings in such cases to be more present to ourselves in<br>
sudden surprises of every sort.<br>
<br>
Her application to a sober life and industrious management at last in<br>
Virginia, with her transported spouse, is a story fruitful of<br>
instruction to all the unfortunate creatures who are obliged to seek<br>
their re-establishment abroad, whether by the misery of transportation<br>
or other disaster; letting them know that diligence and application<br>
have their due encouragement, even in the remotest parts of the world,<br>
and that no case can be so low, so despicable, or so empty of prospect,<br>
but that an unwearied industry will go a great way to deliver us from<br>
it, will in time raise the meanest creature to appear again in the<br>
world, and give him a new case for his life.<br>
<br>
There are a few of the serious inferences which we are led by the hand<br>
to in this book, and these are fully sufficient to justify any man in<br>
recommending it to the world, and much more to justify the publication<br>
of it.<br>
<br>
There are two of the most beautiful parts still behind, which this<br>
story gives some idea of, and lets us into the parts of them, but they<br>
are either of them too long to be brought into the same volume, and<br>
indeed are, as I may call them, whole volumes of themselves, viz.: 1.<br>
The life of her governess, as she calls her, who had run through, it<br>
seems, in a few years, all the eminent degrees of a gentlewoman, a<br>
whore, and a bawd; a midwife and a midwife-keeper, as they are called;<br>
a pawnbroker, a childtaker, a receiver of thieves, and of thieves&rsquo;<br>
purchase, that is to say, of stolen goods; and in a word, herself a<br>
thief, a breeder up of thieves and the like, and yet at last a<br>
penitent.<br>
<br>
The second is the life of her transported husband, a highwayman, who it<br>
seems, lived a twelve years&rsquo; life of successful villainy upon the road,<br>
and even at last came off so well as to be a volunteer transport, not a<br>
convict; and in whose life there is an incredible variety.<br>
<br>
But, as I have said, these are things too long to bring in here, so<br>
neither can I make a promise of the coming out by themselves.<br>
<br>
We cannot say, indeed, that this history is carried on quite to the end<br>
of the life of this famous Moll Flanders, as she calls herself, for<br>
nobody can write their own life to the full end of it, unless they can<br>
write it after they are dead. But her husband&rsquo;s life, being written by<br>
a third hand, gives a full account of them both, how long they lived<br>
together in that country, and how they both came to England again,<br>
after about eight years, in which time they were grown very rich, and<br>
where she lived, it seems, to be very old, but was not so extraordinary<br>
a penitent as she was at first; it seems only that indeed she always<br>
spoke with abhorrence of her former life, and of every part of it.<br>
<br>
In her last scene, at Maryland and Virginia, many pleasant things<br>
happened, which makes that part of her life very agreeable, but they<br>
are not told with the same elegancy as those accounted for by herself;<br>
so it is still to the more advantage that we break off here.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 MOLL FLANDERS<br>
<br>
<br>
My true name is so well known in the records or registers at Newgate,<br>
and in the Old Bailey, and there are some things of such consequence<br>
still depending there, relating to my particular conduct, that it is<br>
not be expected I should set my name or the account of my family to<br>
this work; perhaps, after my death, it may be better known; at present<br>
it would not be proper, no not though a general pardon should be<br>
issued, even without exceptions and reserve of persons or crimes.<br>
<br>
It is enough to tell you, that as some of my worst comrades, who are<br>
out of the way of doing me harm (having gone out of the world by the<br>
steps and the string, as I often expected to go), knew me by the name<br>
of Moll Flanders, so you may give me leave to speak of myself under<br>
that name till I dare own who I have been, as well as who I am.<br>
<br>
I have been told that in one of our neighbour nations, whether it be in<br>
France or where else I know not, they have an order from the king, that<br>
when any criminal is condemned, either to die, or to the galleys, or to<br>
be transported, if they leave any children, as such are generally<br>
unprovided for, by the poverty or forfeiture of their parents, so they<br>
are immediately taken into the care of the Government, and put into a<br>
hospital called the House of Orphans, where they are bred up, clothed,<br>
fed, taught, and when fit to go out, are placed out to trades or to<br>
services, so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest,<br>
industrious behaviour.<br>
<br>
Had this been the custom in our country, I had not been left a poor<br>
desolate girl without friends, without clothes, without help or helper<br>
in the world, as was my fate; and by which I was not only exposed to<br>
very great distresses, even before I was capable either of<br>
understanding my case or how to amend it, but brought into a course of<br>
life which was not only scandalous in itself, but which in its ordinary<br>
course tended to the swift destruction both of soul and body.<br>
<br>
But the case was otherwise here. My mother was convicted of felony for<br>
a certain petty theft scarce worth naming, viz. having an opportunity<br>
of borrowing three pieces of fine holland of a certain draper in<br>
Cheapside. The circumstances are too long to repeat, and I have heard<br>
them related so many ways, that I can scarce be certain which is the<br>
right account.<br>
<br>
However it was, this they all agree in, that my mother pleaded her<br>
belly, and being found quick with child, she was respited for about<br>
seven months; in which time having brought me into the world, and being<br>
about again, she was called down, as they term it, to her former<br>
judgment, but obtained the favour of being transported to the<br>
plantations, and left me about half a year old; and in bad hands, you<br>
may be sure.<br>
<br>
This is too near the first hours of my life for me to relate anything<br>
of myself but by hearsay; it is enough to mention, that as I was born<br>
in such an unhappy place, I had no parish to have recourse to for my<br>
nourishment in my infancy; nor can I give the least account how I was<br>
kept alive, other than that, as I have been told, some relation of my<br>
mother&rsquo;s took me away for a while as a nurse, but at whose expense, or<br>
by whose direction, I know nothing at all of it.<br>
<br>
The first account that I can recollect, or could ever learn of myself,<br>
was that I had wandered among a crew of those people they call gypsies,<br>
or Egyptians; but I believe it was but a very little while that I had<br>
been among them, for I had not had my skin discoloured or blackened, as<br>
they do very young to all the children they carry about with them; nor<br>
can I tell how I came among them, or how I got from them.<br>
<br>
It was at Colchester, in Essex, that those people left me; and I have a<br>
notion in my head that I left them there (that is, that I hid myself<br>
and would not go any farther with them), but I am not able to be<br>
particular in that account; only this I remember, that being taken up<br>
by some of the parish officers of Colchester, I gave an account that I<br>
came into the town with the gypsies, but that I would not go any<br>
farther with them, and that so they had left me, but whither they were<br>
gone that I knew not, nor could they expect it of me; for though they<br>
send round the country to inquire after them, it seems they could not<br>
be found.<br>
<br>
I was now in a way to be provided for; for though I was not a parish<br>
charge upon this or that part of the town by law, yet as my case came<br>
to be known, and that I was too young to do any work, being not above<br>
three years old, compassion moved the magistrates of the town to order<br>
some care to be taken of me, and I became one of their own as much as<br>
if I had been born in the place.<br>
<br>
In the provision they made for me, it was my good hap to be put to<br>
nurse, as they call it, to a woman who was indeed poor but had been in<br>
better circumstances, and who got a little livelihood by taking such as<br>
I was supposed to be, and keeping them with all necessaries, till they<br>
were at a certain age, in which it might be supposed they might go to<br>
service or get their own bread.<br>
<br>
This woman had also had a little school, which she kept to teach<br>
children to read and to work; and having, as I have said, lived before<br>
that in good fashion, she bred up the children she took with a great<br>
deal of art, as well as with a great deal of care.<br>
<br>
But that which was worth all the rest, she bred them up very<br>
religiously, being herself a very sober, pious woman, very house-wifely<br>
and clean, and very mannerly, and with good behaviour. So that in a<br>
word, expecting a plain diet, coarse lodging, and mean clothes, we were<br>
brought up as mannerly and as genteelly as if we had been at the<br>
dancing-school.<br>
<br>
I was continued here till I was eight years old, when I was terrified<br>
with news that the magistrates (as I think they called them) had<br>
ordered that I should go to service. I was able to do but very little<br>
service wherever I was to go, except it was to run of errands and be a<br>
drudge to some cookmaid, and this they told me of often, which put me<br>
into a great fright; for I had a thorough aversion to going to service,<br>
as they called it (that is, to be a servant), though I was so young;<br>
and I told my nurse, as we called her, that I believed I could get my<br>
living without going to service, if she pleased to let me; for she had<br>
taught me to work with my needle, and spin worsted, which is the chief<br>
trade of that city, and I told her that if she would keep me, I would<br>
work for her, and I would work very hard.<br>
<br>
I talked to her almost every day of working hard; and, in short, I did<br>
nothing but work and cry all day, which grieved the good, kind woman so<br>
much, that at last she began to be concerned for me, for she loved me<br>
very well.<br>
<br>
One day after this, as she came into the room where all we poor<br>
children were at work, she sat down just over against me, not in her<br>
usual place as mistress, but as if she set herself on purpose to<br>
observe me and see me work. I was doing something she had set me to; as<br>
I remember, it was marking some shirts which she had taken to make, and<br>
after a while she began to talk to me. &ldquo;Thou foolish child,&rdquo; says she,<br>
&ldquo;thou art always crying&rdquo; (for I was crying then); &ldquo;prithee, what dost<br>
cry for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Because they will take me away,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and put me to<br>
service, and I can&rsquo;t work housework.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but<br>
though you can&rsquo;t work housework, as you call it, you will learn it in<br>
time, and they won&rsquo;t put you to hard things at first.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, they<br>
will,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and if I can&rsquo;t do it they will beat me, and the maids<br>
will beat me to make me do great work, and I am but a little girl and I<br>
can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo;; and then I cried again, till I could not speak any more<br>
to her.<br>
<br>
This moved my good motherly nurse, so that she from that time resolved<br>
I should not go to service yet; so she bid me not cry, and she would<br>
speak to Mr. Mayor, and I should not go to service till I was bigger.<br>
<br>
Well, this did not satisfy me, for to think of going to service was<br>
such a frightful thing to me, that if she had assured me I should not<br>
have gone till I was twenty years old, it would have been the same to<br>
me; I should have cried, I believe, all the time, with the very<br>
apprehension of its being to be so at last.<br>
<br>
When she saw that I was not pacified yet, she began to be angry with<br>
me. &ldquo;And what would you have?&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t I tell you that you<br>
shall not go to service till your are bigger?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but then<br>
I must go at last.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, what?&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;is the girl mad? What would<br>
you be&mdash;a gentlewoman?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says I, and cried heartily till I roared<br>
out again.<br>
<br>
This set the old gentlewoman a-laughing at me, as you may be sure it<br>
would. &ldquo;Well, madam, forsooth,&rdquo; says she, gibing at me, &ldquo;you would be a<br>
gentlewoman; and pray how will you come to be a gentlewoman? What! will<br>
you do it by your fingers&rsquo; end?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says I again, very innocently.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, what can you earn?&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;what can you get at your work?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Threepence,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when I spin, and fourpence when I work plain<br>
work.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! poor gentlewoman,&rdquo; said she again, laughing, &ldquo;what will that do<br>
for thee?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It will keep me,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if you will let me live with you.&rdquo; And this<br>
I said in such a poor petitioning tone, that it made the poor woman&rsquo;s<br>
heart yearn to me, as she told me afterwards.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;that will not keep you and buy you clothes too; and<br>
who must buy the little gentlewoman clothes?&rdquo; says she, and smiled all<br>
the while at me.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will work harder, then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and you shall have it all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Poor child! it won&rsquo;t keep you,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;it will hardly keep you in<br>
victuals.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then I will have no victuals,&rdquo; says I, again very innocently; &ldquo;let me<br>
but live with you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, can you live without victuals?&rdquo; says she.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; again says I, very much like a child, you may be sure, and still<br>
I cried heartily.<br>
<br>
I had no policy in all this; you may easily see it was all nature; but<br>
it was joined with so much innocence and so much passion that, in<br>
short, it set the good motherly creature a-weeping too, and she cried<br>
at last as fast as I did, and then took me and led me out of the<br>
teaching-room. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you shan&rsquo;t go to service; you shall<br>
live with me&rdquo;; and this pacified me for the present.<br>
<br>
Some time after this, she going to wait on the Mayor, and talking of<br>
such things as belonged to her business, at last my story came up, and<br>
my good nurse told Mr. Mayor the whole tale. He was so pleased with it,<br>
that he would call his lady and his two daughters to hear it, and it<br>
made mirth enough among them, you may be sure.<br>
<br>
However, not a week had passed over, but on a sudden comes Mrs.<br>
Mayoress and her two daughters to the house to see my old nurse, and to<br>
see her school and the children. When they had looked about them a<br>
little, &ldquo;Well, Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; says the Mayoress to my nurse, &ldquo;and pray which<br>
is the little lass that intends to be a gentlewoman?&rdquo; I heard her, and<br>
I was terribly frighted at first, though I did not know why neither;<br>
but Mrs. Mayoress comes up to me. &ldquo;Well, miss,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and what are<br>
you at work upon?&rdquo; The word miss was a language that had hardly been<br>
heard of in our school, and I wondered what sad name it was she called<br>
me. However, I stood up, made a curtsy, and she took my work out of my<br>
hand, looked on it, and said it was very well; then she took up one of<br>
the hands. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;the child may come to be a gentlewoman for<br>
aught anybody knows; she has a gentlewoman&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; says she. This<br>
pleased me mightily, you may be sure; but Mrs. Mayoress did not stop<br>
there, but giving me my work again, she put her hand in her pocket,<br>
gave me a shilling, and bid me mind my work, and learn to work well,<br>
and I might be a gentlewoman for aught she knew.<br>
<br>
Now all this while my good old nurse, Mrs. Mayoress, and all the rest<br>
of them did not understand me at all, for they meant one sort of thing<br>
by the word gentlewoman, and I meant quite another; for alas! all I<br>
understood by being a gentlewoman was to be able to work for myself,<br>
and get enough to keep me without that terrible bugbear going to<br>
service, whereas they meant to live great, rich and high, and I know<br>
not what.<br>
<br>
Well, after Mrs. Mayoress was gone, her two daughters came in, and they<br>
called for the gentlewoman too, and they talked a long while to me, and<br>
I answered them in my innocent way; but always, if they asked me<br>
whether I resolved to be a gentlewoman, I answered Yes. At last one of<br>
them asked me what a gentlewoman was? That puzzled me much; but,<br>
however, I explained myself negatively, that it was one that did not go<br>
to service, to do housework. They were pleased to be familiar with me,<br>
and like my little prattle to them, which, it seems, was agreeable<br>
enough to them, and they gave me money too.<br>
<br>
As for my money, I gave it all to my mistress-nurse, as I called her,<br>
and told her she should have all I got for myself when I was a<br>
gentlewoman, as well as now. By this and some other of my talk, my old<br>
tutoress began to understand me about what I meant by being a<br>
gentlewoman, and that I understood by it no more than to be able to get<br>
my bread by my own work; and at last she asked me whether it was not<br>
so.<br>
<br>
I told her, yes, and insisted on it, that to do so was to be a<br>
gentlewoman; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;there is such a one,&rdquo; naming a woman that<br>
mended lace and washed the ladies&rsquo; laced-heads; &ldquo;she,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is a<br>
gentlewoman, and they call her madam.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; says my good old nurse, &ldquo;you may soon be such a<br>
gentlewoman as that, for she is a person of ill fame, and has had two<br>
or three bastards.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I did not understand anything of that; but I answered, &ldquo;I am sure they<br>
call her madam, and she does not go to service nor do housework&rdquo;; and<br>
therefore I insisted that she was a gentlewoman, and I would be such a<br>
gentlewoman as that.<br>
<br>
The ladies were told all this again, to be sure, and they made<br>
themselves merry with it, and every now and then the young ladies, Mr.<br>
Mayor&rsquo;s daughters, would come and see me, and ask where the little<br>
gentlewoman was, which made me not a little proud of myself.<br>
<br>
This held a great while, and I was often visited by these young ladies,<br>
and sometimes they brought others with them; so that I was known by it<br>
almost all over the town.<br>
<br>
I was now about ten years old, and began to look a little womanish, for<br>
I was mighty grave and humble, very mannerly, and as I had often heard<br>
the ladies say I was pretty, and would be a very handsome woman, so you<br>
may be sure that hearing them say so made me not a little proud.<br>
However, that pride had no ill effect upon me yet; only, as they often<br>
gave me money, and I gave it to my old nurse, she, honest woman, was so<br>
just to me as to lay it all out again for me, and gave me head-dresses,<br>
and linen, and gloves, and ribbons, and I went very neat, and always<br>
clean; for that I would do, and if I had rags on, I would always be<br>
clean, or else I would dabble them in water myself; but, I say, my good<br>
nurse, when I had money given me, very honestly laid it out for me, and<br>
would always tell the ladies this or that was bought with their money;<br>
and this made them oftentimes give me more, till at last I was indeed<br>
called upon by the magistrates, as I understood it, to go out to<br>
service; but then I was come to be so good a workwoman myself, and the<br>
ladies were so kind to me, that it was plain I could maintain<br>
myself&mdash;that is to say, I could earn as much for my nurse as she was<br>
able by it to keep me&mdash;so she told them that if they would give her<br>
leave, she would keep the gentlewoman, as she called me, to be her<br>
assistant and teach the children, which I was very well able to do; for<br>
I was very nimble at my work, and had a good hand with my needle,<br>
though I was yet very young.<br>
<br>
But the kindness of the ladies of the town did not end here, for when<br>
they came to understand that I was no more maintained by the public<br>
allowance as before, they gave me money oftener than formerly; and as I<br>
grew up they brought me work to do for them, such as linen to make, and<br>
laces to mend, and heads to dress up, and not only paid me for doing<br>
them, but even taught me how to do them; so that now I was a<br>
gentlewoman indeed, as I understood that word, I not only found myself<br>
clothes and paid my nurse for my keeping, but got money in my pocket<br>
too beforehand.<br>
<br>
The ladies also gave me clothes frequently of their own or their<br>
children&rsquo;s; some stockings, some petticoats, some gowns, some one<br>
thing, some another, and these my old woman managed for me like a mere<br>
mother, and kept them for me, obliged me to mend them, and turn them<br>
and twist them to the best advantage, for she was a rare housewife.<br>
<br>
At last one of the ladies took so much fancy to me that she would have<br>
me home to her house, for a month, she said, to be among her daughters.<br>
<br>
Now, though this was exceeding kind in her, yet, as my old good woman<br>
said to her, unless she resolved to keep me for good and all, she would<br>
do the little gentlewoman more harm than good. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the lady,<br>
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s true; and therefore I&rsquo;ll only take her home for a week, then,<br>
that I may see how my daughters and she agree together, and how I like<br>
her temper, and then I&rsquo;ll tell you more; and in the meantime, if<br>
anybody comes to see her as they used to do, you may only tell them you<br>
have sent her out to my house.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was prudently managed enough, and I went to the lady&rsquo;s house; but<br>
I was so pleased there with the young ladies, and they so pleased with<br>
me, that I had enough to do to come away, and they were as unwilling to<br>
part with me.<br>
<br>
However, I did come away, and lived almost a year more with my honest<br>
old woman, and began now to be very helpful to her; for I was almost<br>
fourteen years old, was tall of my age, and looked a little womanish;<br>
but I had such a taste of genteel living at the lady&rsquo;s house that I was<br>
not so easy in my old quarters as I used to be, and I thought it was<br>
fine to be a gentlewoman indeed, for I had quite other notions of a<br>
gentlewoman now than I had before; and as I thought, I say, that it was<br>
fine to be a gentlewoman, so I loved to be among gentlewomen, and<br>
therefore I longed to be there again.<br>
<br>
About the time that I was fourteen years and a quarter old, my good<br>
nurse, mother I rather to call her, fell sick and died. I was then in a<br>
sad condition indeed, for as there is no great bustle in putting an end<br>
to a poor body&rsquo;s family when once they are carried to the grave, so the<br>
poor good woman being buried, the parish children she kept were<br>
immediately removed by the church-wardens; the school was at an end,<br>
and the children of it had no more to do but just stay at home till<br>
they were sent somewhere else; and as for what she left, her daughter,<br>
a married woman with six or seven children, came and swept it all away<br>
at once, and removing the goods, they had no more to say to me than to<br>
jest with me, and tell me that the little gentlewoman might set up for<br>
herself if she pleased.<br>
<br>
I was frighted out of my wits almost, and knew not what to do, for I<br>
was, as it were, turned out of doors to the wide world, and that which<br>
was still worse, the old honest woman had two-and-twenty shillings of<br>
mine in her hand, which was all the estate the little gentlewoman had<br>
in the world; and when I asked the daughter for it, she huffed me and<br>
laughed at me, and told me she had nothing to do with it.<br>
<br>
It was true the good, poor woman had told her daughter of it, and that<br>
it lay in such a place, that it was the child&rsquo;s money, and had called<br>
once or twice for me to give it me, but I was, unhappily, out of the<br>
way somewhere or other, and when I came back she was past being in a<br>
condition to speak of it. However, the daughter was so honest<br>
afterwards as to give it me, though at first she used me cruelly about<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Now was I a poor gentlewoman indeed, and I was just that very night to<br>
be turned into the wide world; for the daughter removed all the goods,<br>
and I had not so much as a lodging to go to, or a bit of bread to eat.<br>
But it seems some of the neighbours, who had known my circumstances,<br>
took so much compassion of me as to acquaint the lady in whose family I<br>
had been a week, as I mentioned above; and immediately she sent her<br>
maid to fetch me away, and two of her daughters came with the maid<br>
though unsent. So I went with them, bag and baggage, and with a glad<br>
heart, you may be sure. The fright of my condition had made such an<br>
impression upon me, that I did not want now to be a gentlewoman, but<br>
was very willing to be a servant, and that any kind of servant they<br>
thought fit to have me be.<br>
<br>
But my new generous mistress, for she exceeded the good woman I was<br>
with before, in everything, as well as in the matter of estate; I say,<br>
in everything except honesty; and for that, though this was a lady most<br>
exactly just, yet I must not forget to say on all occasions, that the<br>
first, though poor, was as uprightly honest as it was possible for any<br>
one to be.<br>
<br>
I was no sooner carried away, as I have said, by this good gentlewoman,<br>
but the first lady, that is to say, the Mayoress that was, sent her two<br>
daughters to take care of me; and another family which had taken notice<br>
of me when I was the little gentlewoman, and had given me work to do,<br>
sent for me after her, so that I was mightily made of, as we say; nay,<br>
and they were not a little angry, especially madam the Mayoress, that<br>
her friend had taken me away from her, as she called it; for, as she<br>
said, I was hers by right, she having been the first that took any<br>
notice of me. But they that had me would not part with me; and as for<br>
me, though I should have been very well treated with any of the others,<br>
yet I could not be better than where I was.<br>
<br>
Here I continued till I was between seventeen and eighteen years old,<br>
and here I had all the advantages for my education that could be<br>
imagined; the lady had masters home to the house to teach her daughters<br>
to dance, and to speak French, and to write, and other to teach them<br>
music; and I was always with them, I learned as fast as they; and<br>
though the masters were not appointed to teach me, yet I learned by<br>
imitation and inquiry all that they learned by instruction and<br>
direction; so that, in short, I learned to dance and speak French as<br>
well as any of them, and to sing much better, for I had a better voice<br>
than any of them. I could not so readily come at playing on the<br>
harpsichord or spinet, because I had no instrument of my own to<br>
practice on, and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they<br>
left it, which was uncertain; but yet I learned tolerably well too, and<br>
the young ladies at length got two instruments, that is to say, a<br>
harpsichord and a spinet too, and then they taught me themselves. But<br>
as to dancing, they could hardly help my learning country-dances,<br>
because they always wanted me to make up even number; and, on the other<br>
hand, they were as heartily willing to learn me everything that they<br>
had been taught themselves, as I could be to take the learning.<br>
<br>
By this means I had, as I have said above, all the advantages of<br>
education that I could have had if I had been as much a gentlewoman as<br>
they were with whom I lived; and in some things I had the advantage of<br>
my ladies, though they were my superiors; but they were all the gifts<br>
of nature, and which all their fortunes could not furnish. First, I was<br>
apparently handsomer than any of them; secondly, I was better shaped;<br>
and, thirdly, I sang better, by which I mean I had a better voice; in<br>
all which you will, I hope, allow me to say, I do not speak my own<br>
conceit of myself, but the opinion of all that knew the family.<br>
<br>
I had with all these the common vanity of my sex, viz. that being<br>
really taken for very handsome, or, if you please, for a great beauty,<br>
I very well knew it, and had as good an opinion of myself as anybody<br>
else could have of me; and particularly I loved to hear anybody speak<br>
of it, which could not but happen to me sometimes, and was a great<br>
satisfaction to me.<br>
<br>
Thus far I have had a smooth story to tell of myself, and in all this<br>
part of my life I not only had the reputation of living in a very good<br>
family, and a family noted and respected everywhere for virtue and<br>
sobriety, and for every valuable thing; but I had the character too of<br>
a very sober, modest, and virtuous young woman, and such I had always<br>
been; neither had I yet any occasion to think of anything else, or to<br>
know what a temptation to wickedness meant.<br>
<br>
But that which I was too vain of was my ruin, or rather my vanity was<br>
the cause of it. The lady in the house where I was had two sons, young<br>
gentlemen of very promising parts and of extraordinary behaviour, and<br>
it was my misfortune to be very well with them both, but they managed<br>
themselves with me in a quite different manner.<br>
<br>
The eldest, a gay gentleman that knew the town as well as the country,<br>
and though he had levity enough to do an ill-natured thing, yet had too<br>
much judgment of things to pay too dear for his pleasures; he began<br>
with the unhappy snare to all women, viz. taking notice upon all<br>
occasions how pretty I was, as he called it, how agreeable, how<br>
well-carriaged, and the like; and this he contrived so subtly, as if he<br>
had known as well how to catch a woman in his net as a partridge when<br>
he went a-setting; for he would contrive to be talking this to his<br>
sisters when, though I was not by, yet when he knew I was not far off<br>
but that I should be sure to hear him. His sisters would return softly<br>
to him, &ldquo;Hush, brother, she will hear you; she is but in the next<br>
room.&rdquo; Then he would put it off and talk softlier, as if he had not<br>
known it, and begin to acknowledge he was wrong; and then, as if he had<br>
forgot himself, he would speak aloud again, and I, that was so well<br>
pleased to hear it, was sure to listen for it upon all occasions.<br>
<br>
After he had thus baited his hook, and found easily enough the method<br>
how to lay it in my way, he played an opener game; and one day, going<br>
by his sister&rsquo;s chamber when I was there, doing something about<br>
dressing her, he comes in with an air of gaiety. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Betty,&rdquo; said<br>
he to me, &ldquo;how do you do, Mrs. Betty? Don&rsquo;t your cheeks burn, Mrs.<br>
Betty?&rdquo; I made a curtsy and blushed, but said nothing. &ldquo;What makes you<br>
talk so, brother?&rdquo; says the lady. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we have been talking<br>
of her below-stairs this half-hour.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says his sister, &ldquo;you can<br>
say no harm of her, that I am sure, so &rsquo;tis no matter what you have<br>
been talking about.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis so far from talking harm of<br>
her, that we have been talking a great deal of good, and a great many<br>
fine things have been said of Mrs. Betty, I assure you; and<br>
particularly, that she is the handsomest young woman in Colchester;<br>
and, in short, they begin to toast her health in the town.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I wonder at you, brother,&rdquo; says the sister. &ldquo;Betty wants but one<br>
thing, but she had as good want everything, for the market is against<br>
our sex just now; and if a young woman have beauty, birth, breeding,<br>
wit, sense, manners, modesty, and all these to an extreme, yet if she<br>
have not money, she&rsquo;s nobody, she had as good want them all for nothing<br>
but money now recommends a woman; the men play the game all into their<br>
own hands.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Her younger brother, who was by, cried, &ldquo;Hold, sister, you run too<br>
fast; I am an exception to your rule. I assure you, if I find a woman<br>
so accomplished as you talk of, I say, I assure you, I would not<br>
trouble myself about the money.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the sister, &ldquo;but you will take care not to fancy one, then,<br>
without the money.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that neither,&rdquo; says the brother.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But why, sister,&rdquo; says the elder brother, &ldquo;why do you exclaim so at<br>
the men for aiming so much at the fortune? You are none of them that<br>
want a fortune, whatever else you want.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I understand you, brother,&rdquo; replies the lady very smartly; &ldquo;you<br>
suppose I have the money, and want the beauty; but as times go now, the<br>
first will do without the last, so I have the better of my neighbours.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the younger brother, &ldquo;but your neighbours, as you call<br>
them, may be even with you, for beauty will steal a husband sometimes<br>
in spite of money, and when the maid chances to be handsomer than the<br>
mistress, she oftentimes makes as good a market, and rides in a coach<br>
before her.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I thought it was time for me to withdraw and leave them, and I did so,<br>
but not so far but that I heard all their discourse, in which I heard<br>
abundance of the fine things said of myself, which served to prompt my<br>
vanity, but, as I soon found, was not the way to increase my interest<br>
in the family, for the sister and the younger brother fell grievously<br>
out about it; and as he said some very disobliging things to her upon<br>
my account, so I could easily see that she resented them by her future<br>
conduct to me, which indeed was very unjust to me, for I had never had<br>
the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger brother;<br>
indeed, the elder brother, in his distant, remote way, had said a great<br>
many things as in jest, which I had the folly to believe were in<br>
earnest, or to flatter myself with the hopes of what I ought to have<br>
supposed he never intended, and perhaps never thought of.<br>
<br>
It happened one day that he came running upstairs, towards the room<br>
where his sisters used to sit and work, as he often used to do; and<br>
calling to them before he came in, as was his way too, I, being there<br>
alone, stepped to the door, and said, &ldquo;Sir, the ladies are not here,<br>
they are walked down the garden.&rdquo; As I stepped forward to say this,<br>
towards the door, he was just got to the door, and clasping me in his<br>
arms, as if it had been by chance, &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Betty,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are you<br>
here? That&rsquo;s better still; I want to speak with you more than I do with<br>
them&rdquo;; and then, having me in his arms, he kissed me three or four<br>
times.<br>
<br>
I struggled to get away, and yet did it but faintly neither, and he<br>
held me fast, and still kissed me, till he was almost out of breath,<br>
and then, sitting down, says, &ldquo;Dear Betty, I am in love with you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
His words, I must confess, fired my blood; all my spirits flew about my<br>
heart and put me into disorder enough, which he might easily have seen<br>
in my face. He repeated it afterwards several times, that he was in<br>
love with me, and my heart spoke as plain as a voice, that I liked it;<br>
nay, whenever he said, &ldquo;I am in love with you,&rdquo; my blushes plainly<br>
replied, &ldquo;Would you were, sir.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
However, nothing else passed at that time; it was but a surprise, and<br>
when he was gone I soon recovered myself again. He had stayed longer<br>
with me, but he happened to look out at the window and see his sisters<br>
coming up the garden, so he took his leave, kissed me again, told me he<br>
was very serious, and I should hear more of him very quickly, and away<br>
he went, leaving me infinitely pleased, though surprised; and had there<br>
not been one misfortune in it, I had been in the right, but the mistake<br>
lay here, that Mrs. Betty was in earnest and the gentleman was not.<br>
<br>
From this time my head ran upon strange things, and I may truly say I<br>
was not myself; to have such a gentleman talk to me of being in love<br>
with me, and of my being such a charming creature, as he told me I was;<br>
these were things I knew not how to bear, my vanity was elevated to the<br>
last degree. It is true I had my head full of pride, but, knowing<br>
nothing of the wickedness of the times, I had not one thought of my own<br>
safety or of my virtue about me; and had my young master offered it at<br>
first sight, he might have taken any liberty he thought fit with me;<br>
but he did not see his advantage, which was my happiness for that time.<br>
<br>
After this attack it was not long but he found an opportunity to catch<br>
me again, and almost in the same posture; indeed, it had more of design<br>
in it on his part, though not on my part. It was thus: the young ladies<br>
were all gone a-visiting with their mother; his brother was out of<br>
town; and as for his father, he had been in London for a week before.<br>
He had so well watched me that he knew where I was, though I did not so<br>
much as know that he was in the house; and he briskly comes up the<br>
stairs and, seeing me at work, comes into the room to me directly, and<br>
began just as he did before, with taking me in his arms, and kissing me<br>
for almost a quarter of an hour together.<br>
<br>
It was his younger sister&rsquo;s chamber that I was in, and as there was<br>
nobody in the house but the maids below-stairs, he was, it may be, the<br>
ruder; in short, he began to be in earnest with me indeed. Perhaps he<br>
found me a little too easy, for God knows I made no resistance to him<br>
while he only held me in his arms and kissed me; indeed, I was too well<br>
pleased with it to resist him much.<br>
<br>
However, as it were, tired with that kind of work, we sat down, and<br>
there he talked with me a great while; he said he was charmed with me,<br>
and that he could not rest night or day till he had told me how he was<br>
in love with me, and, if I was able to love him again, and would make<br>
him happy, I should be the saving of his life, and many such fine<br>
things. I said little to him again, but easily discovered that I was a<br>
fool, and that I did not in the least perceive what he meant.<br>
<br>
Then he walked about the room, and taking me by the hand, I walked with<br>
him; and by and by, taking his advantage, he threw me down upon the<br>
bed, and kissed me there most violently; but, to give him his due,<br>
offered no manner of rudeness to me, only kissed a great while. After<br>
this he thought he had heard somebody come upstairs, so got off from<br>
the bed, lifted me up, professing a great deal of love for me, but told<br>
me it was all an honest affection, and that he meant no ill to me; and<br>
with that he put five guineas into my hand, and went away downstairs.<br>
<br>
I was more confounded with the money than I was before with the love,<br>
and began to be so elevated that I scarce knew the ground I stood on. I<br>
am the more particular in this part, that if my story comes to be read<br>
by any innocent young body, they may learn from it to guard themselves<br>
against the mischiefs which attend an early knowledge of their own<br>
beauty. If a young woman once thinks herself handsome, she never doubts<br>
the truth of any man that tells her he is in love with her; for if she<br>
believes herself charming enough to captivate him, &rsquo;tis natural to<br>
expect the effects of it.<br>
<br>
This young gentleman had fired his inclination as much as he had my<br>
vanity, and, as if he had found that he had an opportunity and was<br>
sorry he did not take hold of it, he comes up again in half an hour or<br>
thereabouts, and falls to work with me again as before, only with a<br>
little less introduction.<br>
<br>
And first, when he entered the room, he turned about and shut the door.<br>
&ldquo;Mrs. Betty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I fancied before somebody was coming upstairs,<br>
but it was not so; however,&rdquo; adds he, &ldquo;if they find me in the room with<br>
you, they shan&rsquo;t catch me a-kissing of you.&rdquo; I told him I did not know<br>
who should be coming upstairs, for I believed there was nobody in the<br>
house but the cook and the other maid, and they never came up those<br>
stairs. &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis good to be sure, however&rdquo;; and<br>
so he sits down, and we began to talk. And now, though I was still all<br>
on fire with his first visit, and said little, he did as it were put<br>
words in my mouth, telling me how passionately he loved me, and that<br>
though he could not mention such a thing till he came to this estate,<br>
yet he was resolved to make me happy then, and himself too; that is to<br>
say, to marry me, and abundance of such fine things, which I, poor<br>
fool, did not understand the drift of, but acted as if there was no<br>
such thing as any kind of love but that which tended to matrimony; and<br>
if he had spoke of that, I had no room, as well as no power, to have<br>
said no; but we were not come that length yet.<br>
<br>
We had not sat long, but he got up, and, stopping my very breath with<br>
kisses, threw me upon the bed again; but then being both well warmed,<br>
he went farther with me than decency permits me to mention, nor had it<br>
been in my power to have denied him at that moment, had he offered much<br>
more than he did.<br>
<br>
However, though he took these freedoms with me, it did not go to that<br>
which they call the last favour, which, to do him justice, he did not<br>
attempt; and he made that self-denial of his a plea for all his<br>
freedoms with me upon other occasions after this. When this was over,<br>
he stayed but a little while, but he put almost a handful of gold in my<br>
hand, and left me, making a thousand protestations of his passion for<br>
me, and of his loving me above all the women in the world.<br>
<br>
It will not be strange if I now began to think, but alas! it was but<br>
with very little solid reflection. I had a most unbounded stock of<br>
vanity and pride, and but a very little stock of virtue. I did indeed<br>
case sometimes with myself what young master aimed at, but thought of<br>
nothing but the fine words and the gold; whether he intended to marry<br>
me, or not to marry me, seemed a matter of no great consequence to me;<br>
nor did my thoughts so much as suggest to me the necessity of making<br>
any capitulation for myself, till he came to make a kind of formal<br>
proposal to me, as you shall hear presently.<br>
<br>
Thus I gave up myself to a readiness of being ruined without the least<br>
concern and am a fair memento to all young women whose vanity prevails<br>
over their virtue. Nothing was ever so stupid on both sides. Had I<br>
acted as became me, and resisted as virtue and honour require, this<br>
gentleman had either desisted his attacks, finding no room to expect<br>
the accomplishment of his design, or had made fair and honourable<br>
proposals of marriage; in which case, whoever had blamed him, nobody<br>
could have blamed me. In short, if he had known me, and how easy the<br>
trifle he aimed at was to be had, he would have troubled his head no<br>
farther, but have given me four or five guineas, and have lain with me<br>
the next time he had come at me. And if I had known his thoughts, and<br>
how hard he thought I would be to be gained, I might have made my own<br>
terms with him; and if I had not capitulated for an immediate marriage,<br>
I might for a maintenance till marriage, and might have had what I<br>
would; for he was already rich to excess, besides what he had in<br>
expectation; but I seemed wholly to have abandoned all such thoughts as<br>
these, and was taken up only with the pride of my beauty, and of being<br>
beloved by such a gentleman. As for the gold, I spent whole hours in<br>
looking upon it; I told the guineas over and over a thousand times a<br>
day. Never a poor vain creature was so wrapt up with every part of the<br>
story as I was, not considering what was before me, and how near my<br>
ruin was at the door; indeed, I think I rather wished for that ruin<br>
than studied to avoid it.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, however, I was cunning enough not to give the least<br>
room to any in the family to suspect me, or to imagine that I had the<br>
least correspondence with this young gentleman. I scarce ever looked<br>
towards him in public, or answered if he spoke to me when anybody was<br>
near us; but for all that, we had every now and then a little<br>
encounter, where we had room for a word or two, and now and then a<br>
kiss, but no fair opportunity for the mischief intended; and especially<br>
considering that he made more circumlocution than, if he had known my<br>
thoughts, he had occasion for; and the work appearing difficult to him,<br>
he really made it so.<br>
<br>
But as the devil is an unwearied tempter, so he never fails to find<br>
opportunity for that wickedness he invites to. It was one evening that<br>
I was in the garden, with his two younger sisters and himself, and all<br>
very innocently merry, when he found means to convey a note into my<br>
hand, by which he directed me to understand that he would to-morrow<br>
desire me publicly to go of an errand for him into the town, and that I<br>
should see him somewhere by the way.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, after dinner, he very gravely says to me, his sisters<br>
being all by, &ldquo;Mrs. Betty, I must ask a favour of you.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;<br>
says his second sister. &ldquo;Nay, sister,&rdquo; says he very gravely, &ldquo;if you<br>
can&rsquo;t spare Mrs. Betty to-day, any other time will do.&rdquo; Yes, they said,<br>
they could spare her well enough, and the sister begged pardon for<br>
asking, which they did but of mere course, without any meaning. &ldquo;Well,<br>
but, brother,&rdquo; says the eldest sister, &ldquo;you must tell Mrs. Betty what<br>
it is; if it be any private business that we must not hear, you may<br>
call her out. There she is.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, sister,&rdquo; says the gentleman very<br>
gravely, &ldquo;what do you mean? I only desire her to go into the High<br>
Street&rdquo; (and then he pulls out a turnover), &ldquo;to such a shop&rdquo;; and then<br>
he tells them a long story of two fine neckcloths he had bid money for,<br>
and he wanted to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to the<br>
turnover that he showed, to see if they would take my money for the<br>
neckcloths; to bid a shilling more, and haggle with them; and then he<br>
made more errands, and so continued to have such petty business to do,<br>
that I should be sure to stay a good while.<br>
<br>
When he had given me my errands, he told them a long story of a visit<br>
he was going to make to a family they all knew, and where was to be<br>
such-and-such gentlemen, and how merry they were to be, and very<br>
formally asks his sisters to go with him, and they as formally excused<br>
themselves, because of company that they had notice was to come and<br>
visit them that afternoon; which, by the way, he had contrived on<br>
purpose.<br>
<br>
He had scarce done speaking to them, and giving me my errand, but his<br>
man came up to tell him that Sir W&mdash;&mdash; H&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s coach stopped at the door;<br>
so he runs down, and comes up again immediately. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; says he aloud,<br>
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s all my mirth spoiled at once; sir W&mdash;&mdash; has sent his coach for<br>
me, and desires to speak with me upon some earnest business.&rdquo; It seems<br>
this Sir W&mdash;&mdash; was a gentleman who lived about three miles out of town,<br>
to whom he had spoken on purpose the day before, to lend him his<br>
chariot for a particular occasion, and had appointed it to call for<br>
him, as it did, about three o&rsquo;clock.<br>
<br>
Immediately he calls for his best wig, hat, and sword, and ordering his<br>
man to go to the other place to make his excuse&mdash; that was to say, he<br>
made an excuse to send his man away&mdash;he prepares to go into the coach.<br>
As he was going, he stopped a while, and speaks mighty earnestly to me<br>
about his business, and finds an opportunity to say very softly to me,<br>
&ldquo;Come away, my dear, as soon as ever you can.&rdquo; I said nothing, but made<br>
a curtsy, as if I had done so to what he said in public. In about a<br>
quarter of an hour I went out too; I had no dress other than before,<br>
except that I had a hood, a mask, a fan, and a pair of gloves in my<br>
pocket; so that there was not the least suspicion in the house. He<br>
waited for me in the coach in a back-lane, which he knew I must pass<br>
by, and had directed the coachman whither to go, which was to a certain<br>
place, called Mile End, where lived a confidant of his, where we went<br>
in, and where was all the convenience in the world to be as wicked as<br>
we pleased.<br>
<br>
When we were together he began to talk very gravely to me, and to tell<br>
me he did not bring me there to betray me; that his passion for me<br>
would not suffer him to abuse me; that he resolved to marry me as soon<br>
as he came to his estate; that in the meantime, if I would grant his<br>
request, he would maintain me very honourably; and made me a thousand<br>
protestations of his sincerity and of his affection to me; and that he<br>
would never abandon me, and as I may say, made a thousand more<br>
preambles than he need to have done.<br>
<br>
However, as he pressed me to speak, I told him I had no reason to<br>
question the sincerity of his love to me after so many protestations,<br>
but&mdash;and there I stopped, as if I left him to guess the rest. &ldquo;But what,<br>
my dear?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I guess what you mean: what if you should be with<br>
child? Is not that it? Why, then,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you and<br>
provide for you, and the child too; and that you may see I am not in<br>
jest,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s an earnest for you,&rdquo; and with that he pulls out<br>
a silk purse, with an hundred guineas in it, and gave it me. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll<br>
give you such another,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;every year till I marry you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
My colour came and went, at the sight of the purse and with the fire of<br>
his proposal together, so that I could not say a word, and he easily<br>
perceived it; so putting the purse into my bosom, I made no more<br>
resistance to him, but let him do just what he pleased, and as often as<br>
he pleased; and thus I finished my own destruction at once, for from<br>
this day, being forsaken of my virtue and my modesty, I had nothing of<br>
value left to recommend me, either to God&rsquo;s blessing or man&rsquo;s<br>
assistance.<br>
<br>
But things did not end here. I went back to the town, did the business<br>
he publicly directed me to, and was at home before anybody thought me<br>
long. As for my gentleman, he stayed out, as he told me he would, till<br>
late at night, and there was not the least suspicion in the family<br>
either on his account or on mine.<br>
<br>
We had, after this, frequent opportunities to repeat our crime&mdash;chiefly<br>
by his contrivance&mdash;especially at home, when his mother and the young<br>
ladies went abroad a-visiting, which he watched so narrowly as never to<br>
miss; knowing always beforehand when they went out, and then failed not<br>
to catch me all alone, and securely enough; so that we took our fill of<br>
our wicked pleasure for near half a year; and yet, which was the most<br>
to my satisfaction, I was not with child.<br>
<br>
But before this half-year was expired, his younger brother, of whom I<br>
have made some mention in the beginning of the story, falls to work<br>
with me; and he, finding me alone in the garden one evening, begins a<br>
story of the same kind to me, made good honest professions of being in<br>
love with me, and in short, proposes fairly and honourably to marry me,<br>
and that before he made any other offer to me at all.<br>
<br>
I was now confounded, and driven to such an extremity as the like was<br>
never known; at least not to me. I resisted the proposal with<br>
obstinacy; and now I began to arm myself with arguments. I laid before<br>
him the inequality of the match; the treatment I should meet with in<br>
the family; the ingratitude it would be to his good father and mother,<br>
who had taken me into their house upon such generous principles, and<br>
when I was in such a low condition; and, in short, I said everything to<br>
dissuade him from his design that I could imagine, except telling him<br>
the truth, which would indeed have put an end to it all, but that I<br>
durst not think of mentioning.<br>
<br>
But here happened a circumstance that I did not expect indeed, which<br>
put me to my shifts; for this young gentleman, as he was plain and<br>
honest, so he pretended to nothing with me but what was so too; and,<br>
knowing his own innocence, he was not so careful to make his having a<br>
kindness for Mrs. Betty a secret in the house, as his brother was. And<br>
though he did not let them know that he had talked to me about it, yet<br>
he said enough to let his sisters perceive he loved me, and his mother<br>
saw it too, which, though they took no notice of it to me, yet they did<br>
to him, an immediately I found their carriage to me altered, more than<br>
ever before.<br>
<br>
I saw the cloud, though I did not foresee the storm. It was easy, I<br>
say, to see that their carriage to me was altered, and that it grew<br>
worse and worse every day; till at last I got information among the<br>
servants that I should, in a very little while, be desired to remove.<br>
<br>
I was not alarmed at the news, having a full satisfaction that I should<br>
be otherwise provided for; and especially considering that I had reason<br>
every day to expect I should be with child, and that then I should be<br>
obliged to remove without any pretences for it.<br>
<br>
After some time the younger gentleman took an opportunity to tell me<br>
that the kindness he had for me had got vent in the family. He did not<br>
charge me with it, he said, for he know well enough which way it came<br>
out. He told me his plain way of talking had been the occasion of it,<br>
for that he did not make his respect for me so much a secret as he<br>
might have done, and the reason was, that he was at a point, that if I<br>
would consent to have him, he would tell them all openly that he loved<br>
me, and that he intended to marry me; that it was true his father and<br>
mother might resent it, and be unkind, but that he was now in a way to<br>
live, being bred to the law, and he did not fear maintaining me<br>
agreeable to what I should expect; and that, in short, as he believed I<br>
would not be ashamed of him, so he was resolved not to be ashamed of<br>
me, and that he scorned to be afraid to own me now, whom he resolved to<br>
own after I was his wife, and therefore I had nothing to do but to give<br>
him my hand, and he would answer for all the rest.<br>
<br>
I was now in a dreadful condition indeed, and now I repented heartily<br>
my easiness with the eldest brother; not from any reflection of<br>
conscience, but from a view of the happiness I might have enjoyed, and<br>
had now made impossible; for though I had no great scruples of<br>
conscience, as I have said, to struggle with, yet I could not think of<br>
being a whore to one brother and a wife to the other. But then it came<br>
into my thoughts that the first brother had promised to made me his<br>
wife when he came to his estate; but I presently remembered what I had<br>
often thought of, that he had never spoken a word of having me for a<br>
wife after he had conquered me for a mistress; and indeed, till now,<br>
though I said I thought of it often, yet it gave me no disturbance at<br>
all, for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his affection to me,<br>
so neither did he lessen his bounty, though he had the discretion<br>
himself to desire me not to lay out a penny of what he gave me in<br>
clothes, or to make the least show extraordinary, because it would<br>
necessarily give jealousy in the family, since everybody know I could<br>
come at such things no manner of ordinary way, but by some private<br>
friendship, which they would presently have suspected.<br>
<br>
But I was now in a great strait, and knew not what to do. The main<br>
difficulty was this: the younger brother not only laid close siege to<br>
me, but suffered it to be seen. He would come into his sister&rsquo;s room,<br>
and his mother&rsquo;s room, and sit down, and talk a thousand kind things of<br>
me, and to me, even before their faces, and when they were all there.<br>
This grew so public that the whole house talked of it, and his mother<br>
reproved him for it, and their carriage to me appeared quite altered.<br>
In short, his mother had let fall some speeches, as if she intended to<br>
put me out of the family; that is, in English, to turn me out of doors.<br>
Now I was sure this could not be a secret to his brother, only that he<br>
might not think, as indeed nobody else yet did, that the youngest<br>
brother had made any proposal to me about it; but as I easily could see<br>
that it would go farther, so I saw likewise there was an absolute<br>
necessity to speak of it to him, or that he would speak of it to me,<br>
and which to do first I knew not; that is, whether I should break it to<br>
him or let it alone till he should break it to me.<br>
<br>
Upon serious consideration, for indeed now I began to consider things<br>
very seriously, and never till now; I say, upon serious consideration,<br>
I resolved to tell him of it first; and it was not long before I had an<br>
opportunity, for the very next day his brother went to London upon some<br>
business, and the family being out a-visiting, just as it had happened<br>
before, and as indeed was often the case, he came according to his<br>
custom, to spend an hour or two with Mrs. Betty.<br>
<br>
When he came and had sat down a while, he easily perceived there was an<br>
alteration in my countenance, that I was not so free and pleasant with<br>
him as I used to be, and particularly, that I had been a-crying; he was<br>
not long before he took notice of it, and asked me in very kind terms<br>
what was the matter, and if anything troubled me. I would have put it<br>
off if I could, but it was not to be concealed; so after suffering many<br>
importunities to draw that out of me which I longed as much as possible<br>
to disclose, I told him that it was true something did trouble me, and<br>
something of such a nature that I could not conceal from him, and yet<br>
that I could not tell how to tell him of it neither; that it was a<br>
thing that not only surprised me, but greatly perplexed me, and that I<br>
knew not what course to take, unless he would direct me. He told me<br>
with great tenderness, that let it be what it would, I should not let<br>
it trouble me, for he would protect me from all the world.<br>
<br>
I then began at a distance, and told him I was afraid the ladies had<br>
got some secret information of our correspondence; for that it was easy<br>
to see that their conduct was very much changed towards me for a great<br>
while, and that now it was come to that pass that they frequently found<br>
fault with me, and sometimes fell quite out with me, though I never<br>
gave them the least occasion; that whereas I used always to lie with<br>
the eldest sister, I was lately put to lie by myself, or with one of<br>
the maids; and that I had overheard them several times talking very<br>
unkindly about me; but that which confirmed it all was, that one of the<br>
servants had told me that she had heard I was to be turned out, and<br>
that it was not safe for the family that I should be any longer in the<br>
house.<br>
<br>
He smiled when he heard all this, and I asked him how he could make so<br>
light of it, when he must needs know that if there was any discovery I<br>
was undone for ever, and that even it would hurt him, though not ruin<br>
him as it would me. I upbraided him, that he was like all the rest of<br>
the sex, that, when they had the character and honour of a woman at<br>
their mercy, oftentimes made it their jest, and at least looked upon it<br>
as a trifle, and counted the ruin of those they had had their will of<br>
as a thing of no value.<br>
<br>
He saw me warm and serious, and he changed his style immediately; he<br>
told me he was sorry I should have such a thought of him; that he had<br>
never given me the least occasion for it, but had been as tender of my<br>
reputation as he could be of his own; that he was sure our<br>
correspondence had been managed with so much address, that not one<br>
creature in the family had so much as a suspicion of it; that if he<br>
smiled when I told him my thoughts, it was at the assurance he lately<br>
received, that our understanding one another was not so much as known<br>
or guessed at; and that when he had told me how much reason he had to<br>
be easy, I should smile as he did, for he was very certain it would<br>
give me a full satisfaction.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is a mystery I cannot understand,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;or how it should be<br>
to my satisfaction that I am to be turned out of doors; for if our<br>
correspondence is not discovered, I know not what else I have done to<br>
change the countenances of the whole family to me, or to have them<br>
treat me as they do now, who formerly used me with so much tenderness,<br>
as if I had been one of their own children.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, look you, child,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that they are uneasy about you, that<br>
is true; but that they have the least suspicion of the case as it is,<br>
and as it respects you and I, is so far from being true, that they<br>
suspect my brother Robin; and, in short, they are fully persuaded he<br>
makes love to you; nay, the fool has put it into their heads too<br>
himself, for he is continually bantering them about it, and making a<br>
jest of himself. I confess I think he is wrong to do so, because he<br>
cannot but see it vexes them, and makes them unkind to you; but &rsquo;tis a<br>
satisfaction to me, because of the assurance it gives me, that they do<br>
not suspect me in the least, and I hope this will be to your<br>
satisfaction too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;one way; but this does not reach my case at all,<br>
nor is this the chief thing that troubles me, though I have been<br>
concerned about that too.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; says he. With which I<br>
fell to tears, and could say nothing to him at all. He strove to pacify<br>
me all he could, but began at last to be very pressing upon me to tell<br>
what it was. At last I answered that I thought I ought to tell him too,<br>
and that he had some right to know it; besides, that I wanted his<br>
direction in the case, for I was in such perplexity that I knew not<br>
what course to take, and then I related the whole affair to him. I told<br>
him how imprudently his brother had managed himself, in making himself<br>
so public; for that if he had kept it a secret, as such a thing ought<br>
to have been, I could but have denied him positively, without giving<br>
any reason for it, and he would in time have ceased his solicitations;<br>
but that he had the vanity, first, to depend upon it that I would not<br>
deny him, and then had taken the freedom to tell his resolution of<br>
having me to the whole house.<br>
<br>
I told him how far I had resisted him, and told him how sincere and<br>
honourable his offers were. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;my case will be doubly<br>
hard; for as they carry it ill to me now, because he desires to have<br>
me, they&rsquo;ll carry it worse when they shall find I have denied him; and<br>
they will presently say, there&rsquo;s something else in it, and then out it<br>
comes that I am married already to somebody else, or that I would never<br>
refuse a match so much above me as this was.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This discourse surprised him indeed very much. He told me that it was a<br>
critical point indeed for me to manage, and he did not see which way I<br>
should get out of it; but he would consider it, and let me know next<br>
time we met, what resolution he was come to about it; and in the<br>
meantime desired I would not give my consent to his brother, nor yet<br>
give him a flat denial, but that I would hold him in suspense a while.<br>
<br>
I seemed to start at his saying I should not give him my consent. I<br>
told him he knew very well I had no consent to give; that he had<br>
engaged himself to marry me, and that my consent was the same time<br>
engaged to him; that he had all along told me I was his wife, and I<br>
looked upon myself as effectually so as if the ceremony had passed; and<br>
that it was from his own mouth that I did so, he having all along<br>
persuaded me to call myself his wife.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be concerned at that now; if I am not<br>
your husband, I&rsquo;ll be as good as a husband to you; and do not let those<br>
things trouble you now, but let me look a little farther into this<br>
affair, and I shall be able to say more next time we meet.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He pacified me as well as he could with this, but I found he was very<br>
thoughtful, and that though he was very kind to me and kissed me a<br>
thousand times, and more I believe, and gave me money too, yet he<br>
offered no more all the while we were together, which was above two<br>
hours, and which I much wondered at indeed at that time, considering<br>
how it used to be, and what opportunity we had.<br>
<br>
His brother did not come from London for five or six days, and it was<br>
two days more before he got an opportunity to talk with him; but then<br>
getting him by himself he began to talk very close to him about it, and<br>
the same evening got an opportunity (for we had a long conference<br>
together) to repeat all their discourse to me, which, as near as I can<br>
remember, was to the purpose following. He told him he heard strange<br>
news of him since he went, viz. that he made love to Mrs. Betty. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;<br>
says his brother a little angrily, &ldquo;and so I do. And what then? What<br>
has anybody to do with that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says his brother, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be angry,<br>
Robin; I don&rsquo;t pretend to have anything to do with it; nor do I pretend<br>
to be angry with you about it. But I find they do concern themselves<br>
about it, and that they have used the poor girl ill about it, which I<br>
should take as done to myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whom do you mean by _they_?&rdquo; says<br>
Robin. &ldquo;I mean my mother and the girls,&rdquo; says the elder brother. &ldquo;But<br>
hark ye,&rdquo; says his brother, &ldquo;are you in earnest? Do you really love<br>
this girl? You may be free with me, you know.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; says Robin,<br>
&ldquo;I will be free with you; I do love her above all the women in the<br>
world, and I will have her, let them say and do what they will. I<br>
believe the girl will not deny me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It struck me to the heart when he told me this, for though it was most<br>
rational to think I would not deny him, yet I knew in my own conscience<br>
I must deny him, and I saw my ruin in my being obliged to do so; but I<br>
knew it was my business to talk otherwise then, so I interrupted him in<br>
his story thus.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;does he think I cannot deny him? But he shall find I can<br>
deny him, for all that.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but let me give you the whole story as it<br>
went on between us, and then say what you will.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then he went on and told me that he replied thus: &ldquo;But, brother, you<br>
know she has nothing, and you may have several ladies with good<br>
fortunes.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no matter for that,&rdquo; said Robin; &ldquo;I love the girl, and I will<br>
never please my pocket in marrying, and not please my fancy.&rdquo; &ldquo;And so,<br>
my dear,&rdquo; adds he, &ldquo;there is no opposing him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you shall see I can oppose him; I have learnt to<br>
say No, now though I had not learnt it before; if the best lord in the<br>
land offered me marriage now, I could very cheerfully say No to him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, but, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what can you say to him? You know, as<br>
you said when we talked of it before, he will ask you many questions<br>
about it, and all the house will wonder what the meaning of it should<br>
be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, smiling, &ldquo;I can stop all their mouths at one clap by<br>
telling him, and them too, that I am married already to his elder<br>
brother.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He smiled a little too at the word, but I could see it startled him,<br>
and he could not hide the disorder it put him into. However, he<br>
returned, &ldquo;Why, though that may be true in some sense, yet I suppose<br>
you are but in jest when you talk of giving such an answer as that; it<br>
may not be convenient on many accounts.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says I pleasantly, &ldquo;I am not so fond of letting the secret<br>
come out without your consent.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But what, then, can you say to him, or to them,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;when they<br>
find you positive against a match which would be apparently so much to<br>
your advantage?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;should I be at a loss? First of all, I am not obliged<br>
to give me any reason at all; on the other hand, I may tell them I am<br>
married already, and stop there, and that will be a full stop too to<br>
him, for he can have no reason to ask one question after it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;but the whole house will tease you about that, even to<br>
father and mother, and if you deny them positively, they will be<br>
disobliged at you, and suspicious besides.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what can I do? What would you have me do? I was in<br>
straight enough before, and as I told you, I was in perplexity before,<br>
and acquainted you with the circumstances, that I might have your<br>
advice.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I have been considering very much upon it, you may<br>
be sure, and though it is a piece of advice that has a great many<br>
mortifications in it to me, and may at first seem strange to you, yet,<br>
all things considered, I see no better way for you than to let him go<br>
on; and if you find him hearty and in earnest, marry him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I gave him a look full of horror at those words, and, turning pale as<br>
death, was at the very point of sinking down out of the chair I sat in;<br>
when, giving a start, &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says he aloud, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with<br>
you? Where are you a-going?&rdquo; and a great many such things; and with<br>
jogging and called to me, fetched me a little to myself, though it was<br>
a good while before I fully recovered my senses, and was not able to<br>
speak for several minutes more.<br>
<br>
When I was fully recovered he began again. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what<br>
made you so surprised at what I said? I would have you consider<br>
seriously of it? You may see plainly how the family stand in this case,<br>
and they would be stark mad if it was my case, as it is my brother&rsquo;s;<br>
and for aught I see, it would be my ruin and yours too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; says I, still speaking angrily; &ldquo;are all your protestations and<br>
vows to be shaken by the dislike of the family? Did I not always object<br>
that to you, and you made light thing of it, as what you were above,<br>
and would value; and is it come to this now?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Is this your<br>
faith and honour, your love, and the solidity of your promises?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He continued perfectly calm, notwithstanding all my reproaches, and I<br>
was not sparing of them at all; but he replied at last, &ldquo;My dear, I<br>
have not broken one promise with you yet; I did tell you I would marry<br>
you when I was come to my estate; but you see my father is a hale,<br>
healthy man, and may live these thirty years still, and not be older<br>
than several are round us in town; and you never proposed my marrying<br>
you sooner, because you knew it might be my ruin; and as to all the<br>
rest, I have not failed you in anything, you have wanted for nothing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I could not deny a word of this, and had nothing to say to it in<br>
general. &ldquo;But why, then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;can you persuade me to such a horrid<br>
step as leaving you, since you have not left me? Will you allow no<br>
affection, no love on my side, where there has been so much on your<br>
side? Have I made you no returns? Have I given no testimony of my<br>
sincerity and of my passion? Are the sacrifices I have made of honour<br>
and modesty to you no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong<br>
to be broken?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But here, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you may come into a safe station, and<br>
appear with honour and with splendour at once, and the remembrance of<br>
what we have done may be wrapt up in an eternal silence, as if it had<br>
never happened; you shall always have my respect, and my sincere<br>
affection, only then it shall be honest, and perfectly just to my<br>
brother; you shall be my dear sister, as now you are my dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and<br>
there he stopped.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Your dear whore,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you would have said if you had gone on, and<br>
you might as well have said it; but I understand you. However, I desire<br>
you to remember the long discourses you have had with me, and the many<br>
hours&rsquo; pains you have taken to persuade me to believe myself an honest<br>
woman; that I was your wife intentionally, though not in the eyes of<br>
the world, and that it was as effectual a marriage that had passed<br>
between us as if we had been publicly wedded by the parson of the<br>
parish. You know and cannot but remember that these have been your own<br>
words to me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I found this was a little too close upon him, but I made it up in what<br>
follows. He stood stock-still for a while and said nothing, and I went<br>
on thus: &ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;without the highest injustice, believe<br>
that I yielded upon all these persuasions without a love not to be<br>
questioned, not to be shaken again by anything that could happen<br>
afterward. If you have such dishonourable thoughts of me, I must ask<br>
you what foundation in any of my behaviour have I given for such a<br>
suggestion?<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If, then, I have yielded to the importunities of my affection, and if<br>
I have been persuaded to believe that I am really, and in the essence<br>
of the thing, your wife, shall I now give the lie to all those<br>
arguments and call myself your whore, or mistress, which is the same<br>
thing? And will you transfer me to your brother? Can you transfer my<br>
affection? Can you bid me cease loving you, and bid me love him? It is<br>
in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand? No, sir,&rdquo; said<br>
I, &ldquo;depend upon it &rsquo;tis impossible, and whatever the change of your<br>
side may be, I will ever be true; and I had much rather, since it is<br>
come that unhappy length, be your whore than your brother&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He appeared pleased and touched with the impression of this last<br>
discourse, and told me that he stood where he did before; that he had<br>
not been unfaithful to me in any one promise he had ever made yet, but<br>
that there were so many terrible things presented themselves to his<br>
view in the affair before me, and that on my account in particular,<br>
that he had thought of the other as a remedy so effectual as nothing<br>
could come up to it. That he thought this would not be entire parting<br>
us, but we might love as friends all our days, and perhaps with more<br>
satisfaction than we should in the station we were now in, as things<br>
might happen; that he durst say, I could not apprehend anything from<br>
him as to betraying a secret, which could not but be the destruction of<br>
us both, if it came out; that he had but one question to ask of me that<br>
could lie in the way of it, and if that question was answered in the<br>
negative, he could not but think still it was the only step I could<br>
take.<br>
<br>
I guessed at his question presently, namely, whether I was sure I was<br>
not with child? As to that, I told him he need not be concerned about<br>
it, for I was not with child. &ldquo;Why, then, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;we have<br>
no time to talk further now. Consider of it, and think closely about<br>
it; I cannot but be of the opinion still, that it will be the best<br>
course you can take.&rdquo; And with this he took his leave, and the more<br>
hastily too, his mother and sisters ringing at the gate, just at the<br>
moment that he had risen up to go.<br>
<br>
He left me in the utmost confusion of thought; and he easily perceived<br>
it the next day, and all the rest of the week, for it was but Tuesday<br>
evening when we talked; but he had no opportunity to come at me all<br>
that week, till the Sunday after, when I, being indisposed, did not go<br>
to church, and he, making some excuse for the like, stayed at home.<br>
<br>
And now he had me an hour and a half again by myself, and we fell into<br>
the same arguments all over again, or at least so near the same, as it<br>
would be to no purpose to repeat them. At last I asked him warmly, what<br>
opinion he must have of my modesty, that he could suppose I should so<br>
much as entertain a thought of lying with two brothers, and assured him<br>
it could never be. I added, if he was to tell me that he would never<br>
see me more, than which nothing but death could be more terrible, yet I<br>
could never entertain a thought so dishonourable to myself, and so base<br>
to him; and therefore, I entreated him, if he had one grain of respect<br>
or affection left for me, that he would speak no more of it to me, or<br>
that he would pull his sword out and kill me. He appeared surprised at<br>
my obstinacy, as he called it; told me I was unkind to myself, and<br>
unkind to him in it; that it was a crisis unlooked for upon us both,<br>
and impossible for either of us to foresee, but that he did not see any<br>
other way to save us both from ruin, and therefore he thought it the<br>
more unkind; but that if he must say no more of it to me, he added with<br>
an unusual coldness, that he did not know anything else we had to talk<br>
of; and so he rose up to take his leave. I rose up too, as if with the<br>
same indifference; but when he came to give me as it were a parting<br>
kiss, I burst out into such a passion of crying, that though I would<br>
have spoke, I could not, and only pressing his hand, seemed to give him<br>
the adieu, but cried vehemently.<br>
<br>
He was sensibly moved with this; so he sat down again, and said a great<br>
many kind things to me, to abate the excess of my passion, but still<br>
urged the necessity of what he had proposed; all the while insisting,<br>
that if I did refuse, he would notwithstanding provide for me; but<br>
letting me plainly see that he would decline me in the main point&mdash;nay,<br>
even as a mistress; making it a point of honour not to lie with the<br>
woman that, for aught he knew, might come to be his brother&rsquo;s wife.<br>
<br>
The bare loss of him as a gallant was not so much my affliction as the<br>
loss of his person, whom indeed I loved to distraction; and the loss of<br>
all the expectations I had, and which I always had built my hopes upon,<br>
of having him one day for my husband. These things oppressed my mind so<br>
much, that, in short, I fell very ill; the agonies of my mind, in a<br>
word, threw me into a high fever, and long it was, that none in the<br>
family expected my life.<br>
<br>
I was reduced very low indeed, and was often delirious and<br>
light-headed; but nothing lay so near me as the fear that, when I was<br>
light-headed, I should say something or other to his prejudice. I was<br>
distressed in my mind also to see him, and so he was to see me, for he<br>
really loved me most passionately; but it could not be; there was not<br>
the least room to desire it on one side or other, or so much as to make<br>
it decent.<br>
<br>
It was near five weeks that I kept my bed and though the violence of my<br>
fever abated in three weeks, yet it several times returned; and the<br>
physicians said two or three times, they could do no more for me, but<br>
that they must leave nature and the distemper to fight it out, only<br>
strengthening the first with cordials to maintain the struggle. After<br>
the end of five weeks I grew better, but was so weak, so altered, so<br>
melancholy, and recovered so slowly, that the physicians apprehended I<br>
should go into a consumption; and which vexed me most, they gave it as<br>
their opinion that my mind was oppressed, that something troubled me,<br>
and, in short, that I was in love. Upon this, the whole house was set<br>
upon me to examine me, and to press me to tell whether I was in love or<br>
not, and with whom; but as I well might, I denied my being in love at<br>
all.<br>
<br>
They had on this occasion a squabble one day about me at table, that<br>
had like to have put the whole family in an uproar, and for some time<br>
did so. They happened to be all at table but the father; as for me, I<br>
was ill, and in my chamber. At the beginning of the talk, which was<br>
just as they had finished their dinner, the old gentlewoman, who had<br>
sent me somewhat to eat, called her maid to go up and ask me if I would<br>
have any more; but the maid brought down word I had not eaten half what<br>
she had sent me already.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; says the old lady, &ldquo;that poor girl! I am afraid she will never<br>
be well.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; says the elder brother, &ldquo;how should Mrs. Betty be well? They<br>
say she is in love.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I believe nothing of it,&rdquo; says the old gentlewoman.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; says the eldest sister, &ldquo;what to say to it; they have<br>
made such a rout about her being so handsome, and so charming, and I<br>
know not what, and that in her hearing too, that has turned the<br>
creature&rsquo;s head, I believe, and who knows what possessions may follow<br>
such doings? For my part, I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, sister, you must acknowledge she is very handsome,&rdquo; says the<br>
elder brother.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay, and a great deal handsomer than you, sister,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;and<br>
that&rsquo;s your mortification.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well, that is not the question,&rdquo; says his sister; &ldquo;that girl is<br>
well enough, and she knows it well enough; she need not be told of it<br>
to make her vain.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We are not talking of her being vain,&rdquo; says the elder brother, &ldquo;but of<br>
her being in love; it may be she is in love with herself; it seems my<br>
sisters think so.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I would she was in love with me,&rdquo; says Robin; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d quickly put her out<br>
of her pain.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean by that, son,&rdquo; says the old lady; &ldquo;how can you talk<br>
so?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; says Robin, again, very honestly, &ldquo;do you think I&rsquo;d let<br>
the poor girl die for love, and of one that is near at hand to be had,<br>
too?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Fie, brother!&rdquo;, says the second sister, &ldquo;how can you talk so? Would<br>
you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Prithee, child,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;beauty&rsquo;s a portion, and good-humour with<br>
it is a double portion; I wish thou hadst half her stock of both for<br>
thy portion.&rdquo; So there was her mouth stopped.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I find,&rdquo; says the eldest sister, &ldquo;if Betty is not in love, my brother<br>
is. I wonder he has not broke his mind to Betty; I warrant she won&rsquo;t<br>
say No.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;They that yield when they&rsquo;re asked,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;are one step before<br>
them that were never asked to yield, sister, and two steps before them<br>
that yield before they are asked; and that&rsquo;s an answer to you, sister.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This fired the sister, and she flew into a passion, and said, things<br>
were come to that pass that it was time the wench, meaning me, was out<br>
of the family; and but that she was not fit to be turned out, she hoped<br>
her father and mother would consider of it as soon as she could be<br>
removed.<br>
<br>
Robin replied, that was business for the master and mistress of the<br>
family, who where not to be taught by one that had so little judgment<br>
as his eldest sister.<br>
<br>
It ran up a great deal farther; the sister scolded, Robin rallied and<br>
bantered, but poor Betty lost ground by it extremely in the family. I<br>
heard of it, and I cried heartily, and the old lady came up to me,<br>
somebody having told her that I was so much concerned about it. I<br>
complained to her, that it was very hard the doctors should pass such a<br>
censure upon me, for which they had no ground; and that it was still<br>
harder, considering the circumstances I was under in the family; that I<br>
hoped I had done nothing to lessen her esteem for me, or given any<br>
occasion for the bickering between her sons and daughters, and I had<br>
more need to think of a coffin than of being in love, and begged she<br>
would not let me suffer in her opinion for anybody&rsquo;s mistakes but my<br>
own.<br>
<br>
She was sensible of the justice of what I said, but told me, since<br>
there had been such a clamour among them, and that her younger son<br>
talked after such a rattling way as he did, she desired I would be so<br>
faithful to her as to answer her but one question sincerely. I told her<br>
I would, with all my heart, and with the utmost plainness and<br>
sincerity. Why, then, the question was, whether there was anything<br>
between her son Robert and me. I told her with all the protestations of<br>
sincerity that I was able to make, and as I might well, do, that there<br>
was not, nor ever had been; I told her that Mr. Robert had rattled and<br>
jested, as she knew it was his way, and that I took it always, as I<br>
supposed he meant it, to be a wild airy way of discourse that had no<br>
signification in it; and again assured her, that there was not the<br>
least tittle of what she understood by it between us; and that those<br>
who had suggested it had done me a great deal of wrong, and Mr. Robert<br>
no service at all.<br>
<br>
The old lady was fully satisfied, and kissed me, spoke cheerfully to<br>
me, and bid me take care of my health and want for nothing, and so took<br>
her leave. But when she came down she found the brother and all his<br>
sisters together by the ears; they were angry, even to passion, at his<br>
upbraiding them with their being homely, and having never had any<br>
sweethearts, never having been asked the question, and their being so<br>
forward as almost to ask first. He rallied them upon the subject of<br>
Mrs. Betty; how pretty, how good-humoured, how she sung better than<br>
they did, and danced better, and how much handsomer she was; and in<br>
doing this he omitted no ill-natured thing that could vex them, and<br>
indeed, pushed too hard upon them. The old lady came down in the height<br>
of it, and to put a stop it to, told them all the discourse she had had<br>
with me, and how I answered, that there was nothing between Mr. Robert<br>
and I.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s wrong there,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;for if there was not a great deal<br>
between us, we should be closer together than we are. I told her I<br>
loved her hugely,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but I could never make the jade believe I<br>
was in earnest.&rdquo; &ldquo;I do not know how you should,&rdquo; says his mother;<br>
&ldquo;nobody in their senses could believe you were in earnest, to talk so<br>
to a poor girl, whose circumstances you know so well.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But prithee, son,&rdquo; adds she, &ldquo;since you tell me that you could not<br>
make her believe you were in earnest, what must we believe about it?<br>
For you ramble so in your discourse, that nobody knows whether you are<br>
in earnest or in jest; but as I find the girl, by your own confession,<br>
has answered truly, I wish you would do so too, and tell me seriously,<br>
so that I may depend upon it. Is there anything in it or no? Are you in<br>
earnest or no? Are you distracted, indeed, or are you not? &rsquo;Tis a<br>
weighty question, and I wish you would make us easy about it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;By my faith, madam,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis in vain to mince the matter or<br>
tell any more lies about it; I am in earnest, as much as a man is<br>
that&rsquo;s going to be hanged. If Mrs. Betty would say she loved me, and<br>
that she would marry me, I&rsquo;d have her tomorrow morning fasting, and<br>
say, &lsquo;To have and to hold,&rsquo; instead of eating my breakfast.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says the mother, &ldquo;then there&rsquo;s one son lost&rdquo;; and she said it<br>
in a very mournful tone, as one greatly concerned at it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I hope not, madam,&rdquo; says Robin; &ldquo;no man is lost when a good wife has<br>
found him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, but, child,&rdquo; says the old lady, &ldquo;she is a beggar.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, then, madam, she has the more need of charity,&rdquo; says Robin; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll<br>
take her off the hands of the parish, and she and I&rsquo;ll beg together.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad jesting with such things,&rdquo; says the mother.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t jest, madam,&rdquo; says Robin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come and beg your pardon,<br>
madam; and your blessing, madam, and my father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is all out of the way, son,&rdquo; says the mother. &ldquo;If you are in<br>
earnest you are undone.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for I am really afraid she won&rsquo;t have me;<br>
after all my sister&rsquo;s huffing and blustering, I believe I shall never<br>
be able to persuade her to it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine tale, indeed; she is not so far out of her senses<br>
neither. Mrs. Betty is no fool,&rdquo; says the younger sister. &ldquo;Do you think<br>
she has learnt to say No, any more than other people?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, Mrs. Mirth-wit,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;Mrs. Betty&rsquo;s no fool; but Mrs. Betty<br>
may be engaged some other way, and what then?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says the eldest sister, &ldquo;we can say nothing to that. Who must it<br>
be to, then? She is never out of the doors; it must be between you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have nothing to say to that,&rdquo; says Robin. &ldquo;I have been examined<br>
enough; there&rsquo;s my brother. If it must be between us, go to work with<br>
him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This stung the elder brother to the quick, and he concluded that Robin<br>
had discovered something. However, he kept himself from appearing<br>
disturbed. &ldquo;Prithee,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go to shame your stories off upon<br>
me; I tell you, I deal in no such ware; I have nothing to say to Mrs.<br>
Betty, nor to any of the Mrs. Bettys in the parish&rdquo;; and with that he<br>
rose up and brushed off.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says the eldest sister, &ldquo;I dare answer for my brother; he knows<br>
the world better.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Thus the discourse ended, but it left the elder brother quite<br>
confounded. He concluded his brother had made a full discovery, and he<br>
began to doubt whether I had been concerned in it or not; but with all<br>
his management he could not bring it about to get at me. At last he was<br>
so perplexed that he was quite desperate, and resolved he would come<br>
into my chamber and see me, whatever came of it. In order to do this,<br>
he contrived it so, that one day after dinner, watching his eldest<br>
sister till he could see her go upstairs, he runs after her. &ldquo;Hark ye,<br>
sister,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;where is this sick woman? May not a body see her?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says the sister, &ldquo;I believe you may; but let me go first a<br>
little, and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo; So she ran up to the door and gave me<br>
notice, and presently called to him again. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you<br>
may come if you please.&rdquo; So in he came, just in the same kind of rant.<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he at the door as he came in, &ldquo;where is this sick body<br>
that&rsquo;s in love? How do ye do, Mrs. Betty?&rdquo; I would have got up out of<br>
my chair, but was so weak I could not for a good while; and he saw it,<br>
and his sister too, and she said, &ldquo;Come, do not strive to stand up; my<br>
brother desires no ceremony, especially now you are so weak.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,<br>
Mrs. Betty, pray sit still,&rdquo; says he, and so sits himself down in a<br>
chair over against me, and appeared as if he was mighty merry.<br>
<br>
He talked a lot of rambling stuff to his sister and to me, sometimes of<br>
one thing, sometimes of another, on purpose to amuse his sister, and<br>
every now and then would turn it upon the old story, directing it to<br>
me. &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Betty,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it is a sad thing to be in love; why,<br>
it has reduced you sadly.&rdquo; At last I spoke a little. &ldquo;I am glad to see<br>
you so merry, sir,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;but I think the doctor might have found<br>
something better to do than to make his game at his patients. If I had<br>
been ill of no other distemper, I know the proverb too well to have let<br>
him come to me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What proverb?&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Oh! I remember it now. What&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Where love is the case,<br>
The doctor&rsquo;s an ass.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Is not that it, Mrs. Betty?&rdquo; I smiled and said nothing. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says he,<br>
&ldquo;I think the effect has proved it to be love, for it seems the doctor<br>
has been able to do you but little service; you mend very slowly, they<br>
say. I doubt there&rsquo;s somewhat in it, Mrs. Betty; I doubt you are sick<br>
of the incurables, and that is love.&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;No, indeed,<br>
sir, that&rsquo;s none of my distemper.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
We had a deal of such discourse, and sometimes others that signified as<br>
little. By and by he asked me to sing them a song, at which I smiled,<br>
and said my singing days were over. At last he asked me if he should<br>
play upon his flute to me; his sister said she believe it would hurt<br>
me, and that my head could not bear it. I bowed, and said, No, it would<br>
not hurt me. &ldquo;And, pray, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do not hinder it; I love the<br>
music of the flute very much.&rdquo; Then his sister said, &ldquo;Well, do, then,<br>
brother.&rdquo; With that he pulled out the key of his closet. &ldquo;Dear sister,&rdquo;<br>
says he, &ldquo;I am very lazy; do step to my closet and fetch my flute; it<br>
lies in such a drawer,&rdquo; naming a place where he was sure it was not,<br>
that she might be a little while a-looking for it.<br>
<br>
As soon as she was gone, he related the whole story to me of the<br>
discourse his brother had about me, and of his pushing it at him, and<br>
his concern about it, which was the reason of his contriving this visit<br>
to me. I assured him I had never opened my mouth either to his brother<br>
or to anybody else. I told him the dreadful exigence I was in; that my<br>
love to him, and his offering to have me forget that affection and<br>
remove it to another, had thrown me down; and that I had a thousand<br>
times wished I might die rather than recover, and to have the same<br>
circumstances to struggle with as I had before, and that his<br>
backwardness to life had been the great reason of the slowness of my<br>
recovering. I added that I foresaw that as soon as I was well, I must<br>
quit the family, and that as for marrying his brother, I abhorred the<br>
thoughts of it after what had been my case with him, and that he might<br>
depend upon it I would never see his brother again upon that subject;<br>
that if he would break all his vows and oaths and engagements with me,<br>
be that between his conscience and his honour and himself; but he<br>
should never be able to say that I, whom he had persuaded to call<br>
myself his wife, and who had given him the liberty to use me as a wife,<br>
was not as faithful to him as a wife ought to be, whatever he might be<br>
to me.<br>
<br>
He was going to reply, and had said that he was sorry I could not be<br>
persuaded, and was a-going to say more, but he heard his sister<br>
a-coming, and so did I; and yet I forced out these few words as a<br>
reply, that I could never be persuaded to love one brother and marry<br>
another. He shook his head and said, &ldquo;Then I am ruined,&rdquo; meaning<br>
himself; and that moment his sister entered the room and told him she<br>
could not find the flute. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he merrily, &ldquo;this laziness won&rsquo;t<br>
do&rdquo;; so he gets up and goes himself to go to look for it, but comes<br>
back without it too; not but that he could have found it, but because<br>
his mind was a little disturbed, and he had no mind to play; and,<br>
besides, the errand he sent his sister on was answered another way; for<br>
he only wanted an opportunity to speak to me, which he gained, though<br>
not much to his satisfaction.<br>
<br>
I had, however, a great deal of satisfaction in having spoken my mind<br>
to him with freedom, and with such an honest plainness, as I have<br>
related; and though it did not at all work the way I desired, that is<br>
to say, to oblige the person to me the more, yet it took from him all<br>
possibility of quitting me but by a downright breach of honour, and<br>
giving up all the faith of a gentleman to me, which he had so often<br>
engaged by, never to abandon me, but to make me his wife as soon as he<br>
came to his estate.<br>
<br>
It was not many weeks after this before I was about the house again,<br>
and began to grow well; but I continued melancholy, silent, dull, and<br>
retired, which amazed the whole family, except he that knew the reason<br>
of it; yet it was a great while before he took any notice of it, and I,<br>
as backward to speak as he, carried respectfully to him, but never<br>
offered to speak a word to him that was particular of any kind<br>
whatsoever; and this continued for sixteen or seventeen weeks; so that,<br>
as I expected every day to be dismissed the family, on account of what<br>
distaste they had taken another way, in which I had no guilt, so I<br>
expected to hear no more of this gentleman, after all his solemn vows<br>
and protestations, but to be ruined and abandoned.<br>
<br>
At last I broke the way myself in the family for my removing; for being<br>
talking seriously with the old lady one day, about my own circumstances<br>
in the world, and how my distemper had left a heaviness upon my<br>
spirits, that I was not the same thing I was before, the old lady said,<br>
&ldquo;I am afraid, Betty, what I have said to you about my son has had some<br>
influence upon you, and that you are melancholy on his account; pray,<br>
will you let me know how the matter stands with you both, if it may not<br>
be improper? For, as for Robin, he does nothing but rally and banter<br>
when I speak of it to him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, truly, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that matter<br>
stands as I wish it did not, and I shall be very sincere with you in<br>
it, whatever befalls me for it. Mr. Robert has several times proposed<br>
marriage to me, which is what I had no reason to expect, my poor<br>
circumstances considered; but I have always resisted him, and that<br>
perhaps in terms more positive than became me, considering the regard<br>
that I ought to have for every branch of your family; but,&rdquo; said I,<br>
&ldquo;madam, I could never so far forget my obligation to you and all your<br>
house, to offer to consent to a thing which I know must needs be<br>
disobliging to you, and this I have made my argument to him, and have<br>
positively told him that I would never entertain a thought of that kind<br>
unless I had your consent, and his father&rsquo;s also, to whom I was bound<br>
by so many invincible obligations.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And is this possible, Mrs. Betty?&rdquo; says the old lady. &ldquo;Then you have<br>
been much juster to us than we have been to you; for we have all looked<br>
upon you as a kind of snare to my son, and I had a proposal to make to<br>
you for your removing, for fear of it; but I had not yet mentioned it<br>
to you, because I thought you were not thorough well, and I was afraid<br>
of grieving you too much, lest it should throw you down again; for we<br>
have all a respect for you still, though not so much as to have it be<br>
the ruin of my son; but if it be as you say, we have all wronged you<br>
very much.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;As to the truth of what I say, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;refer you to your son<br>
himself; if he will do me any justice, he must tell you the story just<br>
as I have told it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Away goes the old lady to her daughters and tells them the whole story,<br>
just as I had told it her; and they were surprised at it, you may be<br>
sure, as I believed they would be. One said she could never have<br>
thought it; another said Robin was a fool; a third said she would not<br>
believe a word of it, and she would warrant that Robin would tell the<br>
story another way. But the old gentlewoman, who was resolved to go to<br>
the bottom of it before I could have the least opportunity of<br>
acquainting her son with what had passed, resolved too that she would<br>
talk with her son immediately, and to that purpose sent for him, for he<br>
was gone but to a lawyer&rsquo;s house in the town, upon some petty business<br>
of his own, and upon her sending he returned immediately.<br>
<br>
Upon his coming up to them, for they were all still together, &ldquo;Sit<br>
down, Robin,&rdquo; says the old lady, &ldquo;I must have some talk with you.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;With all my heart, madam,&rdquo; says Robin, looking very merry. &ldquo;I hope it<br>
is about a good wife, for I am at a great loss in that affair.&rdquo; &ldquo;How<br>
can that be?&rdquo; says his mother; &ldquo;did not you say you resolved to have<br>
Mrs. Betty?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, madam,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;but there is one has forbid the<br>
banns.&rdquo; &ldquo;Forbid, the banns!&rdquo; says his mother; &ldquo;who can that be?&rdquo; &ldquo;Even<br>
Mrs. Betty herself,&rdquo; says Robin. &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; says his mother. &ldquo;Have you<br>
asked her the question, then?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, indeed, madam,&rdquo; says Robin. &ldquo;I<br>
have attacked her in form five times since she was sick, and am beaten<br>
off; the jade is so stout she won&rsquo;t capitulate nor yield upon any<br>
terms, except such as I cannot effectually grant.&rdquo; &ldquo;Explain yourself,&rdquo;<br>
says the mother, &ldquo;for I am surprised; I do not understand you. I hope<br>
you are not in earnest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the case is plain enough upon me, it explains<br>
itself; she won&rsquo;t have me, she says; is not that plain enough? I think<br>
&rsquo;tis plain, and pretty rough too.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; says the mother, &ldquo;you<br>
talk of conditions that you cannot grant; what does she want&mdash;a<br>
settlement? Her jointure ought to be according to her portion; but what<br>
fortune does she bring you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay, as to fortune,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;she is<br>
rich enough; I am satisfied in that point; but &rsquo;tis I that am not able<br>
to come up to her terms, and she is positive she will not have me<br>
without.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Here the sisters put in. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; says the second sister, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis<br>
impossible to be serious with him; he will never give a direct answer<br>
to anything; you had better let him alone, and talk no more of it to<br>
him; you know how to dispose of her out of his way if you thought there<br>
was anything in it.&rdquo; Robin was a little warmed with his sister&rsquo;s<br>
rudeness, but he was even with her, and yet with good manners too.<br>
&ldquo;There are two sorts of people, madam,&rdquo; says he, turning to his mother,<br>
&ldquo;that there is no contending with; that is, a wise body and a fool;<br>
&rsquo;tis a little hard I should engage with both of them together.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The younger sister then put in. &ldquo;We must be fools indeed,&rdquo; says she,<br>
&ldquo;in my brother&rsquo;s opinion, that he should think we can believe he has<br>
seriously asked Mrs. Betty to marry him, and that she has refused him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Answer, and answer not, say Solomon,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;When your<br>
brother had said to your mother that he had asked her no less than five<br>
times, and that it was so, that she positively denied him, methinks a<br>
younger sister need not question the truth of it when her mother did<br>
not.&rdquo; &ldquo;My mother, you see, did not understand it,&rdquo; says the second<br>
sister. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some difference,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;between desiring me to<br>
explain it, and telling me she did not believe it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, but, son,&rdquo; says the old lady, &ldquo;if you are disposed to let us<br>
into the mystery of it, what were these hard conditions?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo;<br>
says Robin, &ldquo;I had done it before now, if the teasers here had not<br>
worried me by way of interruption. The conditions are, that I bring my<br>
father and you to consent to it, and without that she protests she will<br>
never see me more upon that head; and to these conditions, as I said, I<br>
suppose I shall never be able to grant. I hope my warm sisters will be<br>
answered now, and blush a little; if not, I have no more to say till I<br>
hear further.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This answer was surprising to them all, though less to the mother,<br>
because of what I had said to her. As to the daughters, they stood mute<br>
a great while; but the mother said with some passion, &ldquo;Well, I had<br>
heard this before, but I could not believe it; but if it is so, then we<br>
have all done Betty wrong, and she has behaved better than I ever<br>
expected.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says the eldest sister, &ldquo;if it be so, she has acted<br>
handsomely indeed.&rdquo; &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; says the mother, &ldquo;it was none of her<br>
fault, if he was fool enough to take a fancy to her; but to give such<br>
an answer to him, shows more respect to your father and me than I can<br>
tell how to express; I shall value the girl the better for it as long<br>
as I know her.&rdquo; &ldquo;But I shall not,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;unless you will give<br>
your consent.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consider of that a while,&rdquo; says the mother; &ldquo;I<br>
assure you, if there were not some other objections in the way, this<br>
conduct of hers would go a great way to bring me to consent.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wish<br>
it would go quite through it,&rdquo; says Robin; &ldquo;if you had as much thought<br>
about making me easy as you have about making me rich, you would soon<br>
consent to it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, Robin,&rdquo; says the mother again, &ldquo;are you really in earnest? Would<br>
you so fain have her as you pretend?&rdquo; &ldquo;Really, madam,&rdquo; says Robin, &ldquo;I<br>
think &rsquo;tis hard you should question me upon that head after all I have<br>
said. I won&rsquo;t say that I will have her; how can I resolve that point,<br>
when you see I cannot have her without your consent? Besides, I am not<br>
bound to marry at all. But this I will say, I am in earnest in, that I<br>
will never have anybody else if I can help it; so you may determine for<br>
me. Betty or nobody is the word, and the question which of the two<br>
shall be in your breast to decide, madam, provided only, that my<br>
good-humoured sisters here may have no vote in it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
All this was dreadful to me, for the mother began to yield, and Robin<br>
pressed her home on it. On the other hand, she advised with the eldest<br>
son, and he used all the arguments in the world to persuade her to<br>
consent; alleging his brother&rsquo;s passionate love for me, and my generous<br>
regard to the family, in refusing my own advantages upon such a nice<br>
point of honour, and a thousand such things. And as to the father, he<br>
was a man in a hurry of public affairs and getting money, seldom at<br>
home, thoughtful of the main chance, but left all those things to his<br>
wife.<br>
<br>
You may easily believe, that when the plot was thus, as they thought,<br>
broke out, and that every one thought they knew how things were<br>
carried, it was not so difficult or so dangerous for the elder brother,<br>
whom nobody suspected of anything, to have a freer access to me than<br>
before; nay, the mother, which was just as he wished, proposed it to<br>
him to talk with Mrs. Betty. &ldquo;For it may be, son,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you may<br>
see farther into the thing than I, and see if you think she has been so<br>
positive as Robin says she has been, or no.&rdquo; This was as well as he<br>
could wish, and he, as it were, yielding to talk with me at his<br>
mother&rsquo;s request, she brought me to him into her own chamber, told me<br>
her son had some business with me at her request, and desired me to be<br>
very sincere with him, and then she left us together, and he went and<br>
shut the door after her.<br>
<br>
He came back to me and took me in his arms, and kissed me very<br>
tenderly; but told me he had a long discourse to hold with me, and it<br>
was not come to that crisis, that I should make myself happy or<br>
miserable as long as I lived; that the thing was now gone so far, that<br>
if I could not comply with his desire, we would both be ruined. Then he<br>
told the whole story between Robin, as he called him, and his mother<br>
and sisters and himself, as it is above. &ldquo;And now, dear child,&rdquo; says<br>
he, &ldquo;consider what it will be to marry a gentleman of a good family, in<br>
good circumstances, and with the consent of the whole house, and to<br>
enjoy all that the world can give you; and what, on the other hand, to<br>
be sunk into the dark circumstances of a woman that has lost her<br>
reputation; and that though I shall be a private friend to you while I<br>
live, yet as I shall be suspected always, so you will be afraid to see<br>
me, and I shall be afraid to own you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He gave me no time to reply, but went on with me thus: &ldquo;What has<br>
happened between us, child, so long as we both agree to do so, may be<br>
buried and forgotten. I shall always be your sincere friend, without<br>
any inclination to nearer intimacy, when you become my sister; and we<br>
shall have all the honest part of conversation without any reproaches<br>
between us of having done amiss. I beg of you to consider it, and to<br>
not stand in the way of your own safety and prosperity; and to satisfy<br>
you that I am sincere,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I here offer you &pound;500 in money, to<br>
make you some amends for the freedoms I have taken with you, which we<br>
shall look upon as some of the follies of our lives, which &rsquo;tis hoped<br>
we may repent of.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He spoke this in so much more moving terms than it is possible for me<br>
to express, and with so much greater force of argument than I can<br>
repeat, that I only recommend it to those who read the story, to<br>
suppose, that as he held me above an hour and a half in that discourse,<br>
so he answered all my objections, and fortified his discourse with all<br>
the arguments that human wit and art could devise.<br>
<br>
I cannot say, however, that anything he said made impression enough<br>
upon me so as to give me any thought of the matter, till he told me at<br>
last very plainly, that if I refused, he was sorry to add that he could<br>
never go on with me in that station as we stood before; that though he<br>
loved me as well as ever, and that I was as agreeable to him as ever,<br>
yet sense of virtue had not so far forsaken him as to suffer him to lie<br>
with a woman that his brother courted to make his wife; and if he took<br>
his leave of me, with a denial in this affair, whatever he might do for<br>
me in the point of support, grounded on his first engagement of<br>
maintaining me, yet he would not have me be surprised that he was<br>
obliged to tell me he could not allow himself to see me any more; and<br>
that, indeed, I could not expect it of him.<br>
<br>
I received this last part with some token of surprise and disorder, and<br>
had much ado to avoid sinking down, for indeed I loved him to an<br>
extravagance not easy to imagine; but he perceived my disorder. He<br>
entreated me to consider seriously of it; assured me that it was the<br>
only way to preserve our mutual affection; that in this station we<br>
might love as friends, with the utmost passion, and with a love of<br>
relation untainted, free from our just reproaches, and free from other<br>
people&rsquo;s suspicions; that he should ever acknowledge his happiness<br>
owing to me; that he would be debtor to me as long as he lived, and<br>
would be paying that debt as long as he had breath. Thus he wrought me<br>
up, in short, to a kind of hesitation in the matter; having the dangers<br>
on one side represented in lively figures, and indeed, heightened by my<br>
imagination of being turned out to the wide world a mere cast-off<br>
whore, for it was no less, and perhaps exposed as such, with little to<br>
provide for myself, with no friend, no acquaintance in the whole world,<br>
out of that town, and there I could not pretend to stay. All this<br>
terrified me to the last degree, and he took care upon all occasions to<br>
lay it home to me in the worst colours that it could be possible to be<br>
drawn in. On the other hand, he failed not to set forth the easy,<br>
prosperous life which I was going to live.<br>
<br>
He answered all that I could object from affection, and from former<br>
engagements, with telling me the necessity that was before us of taking<br>
other measures now; and as to his promises of marriage, the nature of<br>
things, he said, had put an end to that, by the probability of my being<br>
his brother&rsquo;s wife, before the time to which his promises all referred.<br>
<br>
Thus, in a word, I may say, he reasoned me out of my reason; he<br>
conquered all my arguments, and I began to see a danger that I was in,<br>
which I had not considered of before, and that was, of being dropped by<br>
both of them and left alone in the world to shift for myself.<br>
<br>
This, and his persuasion, at length prevailed with me to consent,<br>
though with so much reluctance, that it was easy to see I should go to<br>
church like a bear to the stake. I had some little apprehensions about<br>
me, too, lest my new spouse, who, by the way, I had not the least<br>
affection for, should be skillful enough to challenge me on another<br>
account, upon our first coming to bed together. But whether he did it<br>
with design or not, I know not, but his elder brother took care to make<br>
him very much fuddled before he went to bed, so that I had the<br>
satisfaction of a drunken bedfellow the first night. How he did it I<br>
know not, but I concluded that he certainly contrived it, that his<br>
brother might be able to make no judgment of the difference between a<br>
maid and a married woman; nor did he ever entertain any notions of it,<br>
or disturb his thoughts about it.<br>
<br>
I should go back a little here to where I left off. The elder brother<br>
having thus managed me, his next business was to manage his mother, and<br>
he never left till he had brought her to acquiesce and be passive in<br>
the thing, even without acquainting the father, other than by post<br>
letters; so that she consented to our marrying privately, and leaving<br>
her to manage the father afterwards.<br>
<br>
Then he cajoled with his brother, and persuaded him what service he had<br>
done him, and how he had brought his mother to consent, which, though<br>
true, was not indeed done to serve him, but to serve himself; but thus<br>
diligently did he cheat him, and had the thanks of a faithful friend<br>
for shifting off his whore into his brother&rsquo;s arms for a wife. So<br>
certainly does interest banish all manner of affection, and so<br>
naturally do men give up honour and justice, humanity, and even<br>
Christianity, to secure themselves.<br>
<br>
I must now come back to brother Robin, as we always called him, who<br>
having got his mother&rsquo;s consent, as above, came big with the news to<br>
me, and told me the whole story of it, with a sincerity so visible,<br>
that I must confess it grieved me that I must be the instrument to<br>
abuse so honest a gentleman. But there was no remedy; he would have me,<br>
and I was not obliged to tell him that I was his brother&rsquo;s whore,<br>
though I had no other way to put him off; so I came gradually into it,<br>
to his satisfaction, and behold we were married.<br>
<br>
Modesty forbids me to reveal the secrets of the marriage-bed, but<br>
nothing could have happened more suitable to my circumstances than<br>
that, as above, my husband was so fuddled when he came to bed, that he<br>
could not remember in the morning whether he had had any conversation<br>
with me or no, and I was obliged to tell him he had, though in reality<br>
he had not, that I might be sure he could make to inquiry about<br>
anything else.<br>
<br>
It concerns the story in hand very little to enter into the further<br>
particulars of the family, or of myself, for the five years that I<br>
lived with this husband, only to observe that I had two children by<br>
him, and that at the end of five years he died. He had been really a<br>
very good husband to me, and we lived very agreeably together; but as<br>
he had not received much from them, and had in the little time he lived<br>
acquired no great matters, so my circumstances were not great, nor was<br>
I much mended by the match. Indeed, I had preserved the elder brother&rsquo;s<br>
bonds to me, to pay &pound;500, which he offered me for my consent to marry<br>
his brother; and this, with what I had saved of the money he formerly<br>
gave me, about as much more by my husband, left me a widow with about<br>
&pound;1200 in my pocket.<br>
<br>
My two children were, indeed, taken happily off my hands by my<br>
husband&rsquo;s father and mother, and that, by the way, was all they got by<br>
Mrs. Betty.<br>
<br>
I confess I was not suitably affected with the loss of my husband, nor<br>
indeed can I say that I ever loved him as I ought to have done, or as<br>
was proportionable to the good usage I had from him, for he was a<br>
tender, kind, good-humoured man as any woman could desire; but his<br>
brother being so always in my sight, at least while we were in the<br>
country, was a continual snare to me, and I never was in bed with my<br>
husband but I wished myself in the arms of his brother; and though his<br>
brother never offered me the least kindness that way after our<br>
marriage, but carried it just as a brother ought to do, yet it was<br>
impossible for me to do so to him; in short, I committed adultery and<br>
incest with him every day in my desires, which, without doubt, was as<br>
effectually criminal in the nature of the guilt as if I had actually<br>
done it.<br>
<br>
Before my husband died his elder brother was married, and we, being<br>
then removed to London, were written to by the old lady to come and be<br>
at the wedding. My husband went, but I pretended indisposition, and<br>
that I could not possibly travel, so I stayed behind; for, in short, I<br>
could not bear the sight of his being given to another woman, though I<br>
knew I was never to have him myself.<br>
<br>
I was now, as above, left loose to the world, and being still young and<br>
handsome, as everybody said of me, and I assure you I thought myself<br>
so, and with a tolerable fortune in my pocket, I put no small value<br>
upon myself. I was courted by several very considerable tradesmen, and<br>
particularly very warmly by one, a linen-draper, at whose house, after<br>
my husband&rsquo;s death, I took a lodging, his sister being my acquaintance.<br>
Here I had all the liberty and all the opportunity to be gay and appear<br>
in company that I could desire, my landlord&rsquo;s sister being one of the<br>
maddest, gayest things alive, and not so much mistress of her virtue as<br>
I thought at first she had been. She brought me into a world of wild<br>
company, and even brought home several persons, such as she liked well<br>
enough to gratify, to see her pretty widow, so she was pleased to call<br>
me, and that name I got in a little time in public. Now, as fame and<br>
fools make an assembly, I was here wonderfully caressed, had abundance<br>
of admirers, and such as called themselves lovers; but I found not one<br>
fair proposal among them all. As for their common design, that I<br>
understood too well to be drawn into any more snares of that kind. The<br>
case was altered with me: I had money in my pocket, and had nothing to<br>
say to them. I had been tricked once by that cheat called love, but the<br>
game was over; I was resolved now to be married or nothing, and to be<br>
well married or not at all.<br>
<br>
I loved the company, indeed, of men of mirth and wit, men of gallantry<br>
and figure, and was often entertained with such, as I was also with<br>
others; but I found by just observation, that the brightest men came<br>
upon the dullest errand&mdash;that is to say, the dullest as to what I aimed<br>
at. On the other hand, those who came with the best proposals were the<br>
dullest and most disagreeable part of the world. I was not averse to a<br>
tradesman, but then I would have a tradesman, forsooth, that was<br>
something of a gentleman too; that when my husband had a mind to carry<br>
me to the court, or to the play, he might become a sword, and look as<br>
like a gentleman as another man; and not be one that had the mark of<br>
his apron-strings upon his coat, or the mark of his hat upon his<br>
periwig; that should look as if he was set on to his sword, when his<br>
sword was put on to him, and that carried his trade in his countenance.<br>
<br>
Well, at last I found this amphibious creature, this land-water thing<br>
called a gentleman-tradesman; and as a just plague upon my folly, I was<br>
catched in the very snare which, as I might say, I laid for myself. I<br>
said for myself, for I was not trepanned, I confess, but I betrayed<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
This was a draper, too, for though my comrade would have brought me to<br>
a bargain with her brother, yet when it came to the point, it was, it<br>
seems, for a mistress, not a wife; and I kept true to this notion, that<br>
a woman should never be kept for a mistress that had money to keep<br>
herself.<br>
<br>
Thus my pride, not my principle, my money, not my virtue, kept me<br>
honest; though, as it proved, I found I had much better have been sold<br>
by my she-comrade to her brother, than have sold myself as I did to a<br>
tradesman that was rake, gentleman, shopkeeper, and beggar, all<br>
together.<br>
<br>
But I was hurried on (by my fancy to a gentleman) to ruin myself in the<br>
grossest manner that every woman did; for my new husband coming to a<br>
lump of money at once, fell into such a profusion of expense, that all<br>
I had, and all he had before, if he had anything worth mentioning,<br>
would not have held it out above one year.<br>
<br>
He was very fond of me for about a quarter of a year, and what I got by<br>
that was, that I had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of my money<br>
spent upon myself, and, as I may say, had some of the spending it too.<br>
&ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; says he to me one day, &ldquo;shall we go and take a turn<br>
into the country for about a week?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, my dear,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;whither<br>
would you go?&rdquo; &ldquo;I care not whither,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but I have a mind to<br>
look like quality for a week. We&rsquo;ll go to Oxford,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;How,&rdquo; says<br>
I, &ldquo;shall we go? I am no horsewoman, and &rsquo;tis too far for a coach.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Too far!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;no place is too far for a coach-and-six. If I<br>
carry you out, you shall travel like a duchess.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;my<br>
dear, &rsquo;tis a frolic; but if you have a mind to it, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; Well,<br>
the time was appointed, we had a rich coach, very good horses, a<br>
coachman, postillion, and two footmen in very good liveries; a<br>
gentleman on horseback, and a page with a feather in his hat upon<br>
another horse. The servants all called him my lord, and the<br>
inn-keepers, you may be sure, did the like, and I was her honour the<br>
Countess, and thus we traveled to Oxford, and a very pleasant journey<br>
we had; for, give him his due, not a beggar alive knew better how to be<br>
a lord than my husband. We saw all the rarities at Oxford, talked with<br>
two or three Fellows of colleges about putting out a young nephew, that<br>
was left to his lordship&rsquo;s care, to the University, and of their being<br>
his tutors. We diverted ourselves with bantering several other poor<br>
scholars, with hopes of being at least his lordship&rsquo;s chaplains and<br>
putting on a scarf; and thus having lived like quality indeed, as to<br>
expense, we went away for Northampton, and, in a word, in about twelve<br>
days&rsquo; ramble came home again, to the tune of about &pound;93 expense.<br>
<br>
Vanity is the perfection of a fop. My husband had this excellence, that<br>
he valued nothing of expense; and as his history, you may be sure, has<br>
very little weight in it, &rsquo;tis enough to tell you that in about two<br>
years and a quarter he broke, and was not so happy to get over into the<br>
Mint, but got into a sponging-house, being arrested in an action too<br>
heavy from him to give bail to, so he sent for me to come to him.<br>
<br>
It was no surprise to me, for I had foreseen some time that all was<br>
going to wreck, and had been taking care to reserve something if I<br>
could, though it was not much, for myself. But when he sent for me, he<br>
behaved much better than I expected, and told me plainly he had played<br>
the fool, and suffered himself to be surprised, which he might have<br>
prevented; that now he foresaw he could not stand it, and therefore he<br>
would have me go home, and in the night take away everything I had in<br>
the house of any value, and secure it; and after that, he told me that<br>
if I could get away one hundred or two hundred pounds in goods out of<br>
the shop, I should do it; &ldquo;only,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;let me know nothing of it,<br>
neither what you take nor whither you carry it; for as for me,&rdquo; says<br>
he, &ldquo;I am resolved to get out of this house and be gone; and if you<br>
never hear of me more, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I wish you well; I am only<br>
sorry for the injury I have done you.&rdquo; He said some very handsome<br>
things to me indeed at parting; for I told you he was a gentleman, and<br>
that was all the benefit I had of his being so; that he used me very<br>
handsomely and with good manners upon all occasions, even to the last,<br>
only spent all I had, and left me to rob the creditors for something to<br>
subsist on.<br>
<br>
However, I did as he bade me, that you may be sure; and having thus<br>
taken my leave of him, I never saw him more, for he found means to<br>
break out of the bailiff&rsquo;s house that night or the next, and go over<br>
into France, and for the rest of the creditors scrambled for it as well<br>
as they could. How, I knew not, for I could come at no knowledge of<br>
anything, more than this, that he came home about three o&rsquo;clock in the<br>
morning, caused the rest of his goods to be removed into the Mint, and<br>
the shop to be shut up; and having raised what money he could get<br>
together, he got over, as I said, to France, from whence I had one or<br>
two letters from him, and no more. I did not see him when he came home,<br>
for he having given me such instructions as above, and I having made<br>
the best of my time, I had no more business back again at the house,<br>
not knowing but I might have been stopped there by the creditors; for a<br>
commission of bankrupt being soon after issued, they might have stopped<br>
me by orders from the commissioners. But my husband, having so<br>
dexterously got out of the bailiff&rsquo;s house by letting himself down in a<br>
most desperate manner from almost the top of the house to the top of<br>
another building, and leaping from thence, which was almost two<br>
storeys, and which was enough indeed to have broken his neck, he came<br>
home and got away his goods before the creditors could come to seize;<br>
that is to say, before they could get out the commission, and be ready<br>
to send their officers to take possession.<br>
<br>
My husband was so civil to me, for still I say he was much of a<br>
gentleman, that in the first letter he wrote me from France, he let me<br>
know where he had pawned twenty pieces of fine holland for &pound;30, which<br>
were really worth &pound;90, and enclosed me the token and an order for the<br>
taking them up, paying the money, which I did, and made in time above<br>
&pound;100 of them, having leisure to cut them and sell them, some and some,<br>
to private families, as opportunity offered.<br>
<br>
However, with all this, and all that I had secured before, I found,<br>
upon casting things up, my case was very much altered, any my fortune<br>
much lessened; for, including the hollands and a parcel of fine<br>
muslins, which I carried off before, and some plate, and other things,<br>
I found I could hardly muster up &pound;500; and my condition was very odd,<br>
for though I had no child (I had had one by my gentleman draper, but it<br>
was buried), yet I was a widow bewitched; I had a husband and no<br>
husband, and I could not pretend to marry again, though I knew well<br>
enough my husband would never see England any more, if he lived fifty<br>
years. Thus, I say, I was limited from marriage, what offer might<br>
soever be made me; and I had not one friend to advise with in the<br>
condition I was in, least not one I durst trust the secret of my<br>
circumstances to, for if the commissioners were to have been informed<br>
where I was, I should have been fetched up and examined upon oath, and<br>
all I have saved be taken away from me.<br>
<br>
Upon these apprehensions, the first thing I did was to go quite out of<br>
my knowledge, and go by another name. This I did effectually, for I<br>
went into the Mint too, took lodgings in a very private place, dressed<br>
up in the habit of a widow, and called myself Mrs. Flanders.<br>
<br>
Here, however, I concealed myself, and though my new acquaintances knew<br>
nothing of me, yet I soon got a great deal of company about me; and<br>
whether it be that women are scarce among the sorts of people that<br>
generally are to be found there, or that some consolations in the<br>
miseries of the place are more requisite than on other occasions, I<br>
soon found an agreeable woman was exceedingly valuable among the sons<br>
of affliction there, and that those that wanted money to pay half a<br>
crown on the pound to their creditors, and that run in debt at the sign<br>
of the Bull for their dinners, would yet find money for a supper, if<br>
they liked the woman.<br>
<br>
However, I kept myself safe yet, though I began, like my Lord<br>
Rochester&rsquo;s mistress, that loved his company, but would not admit him<br>
farther, to have the scandal of a whore, without the joy; and upon this<br>
score, tired with the place, and indeed with the company too, I began<br>
to think of removing.<br>
<br>
It was indeed a subject of strange reflection to me to see men who were<br>
overwhelmed in perplexed circumstances, who were reduced some degrees<br>
below being ruined, whose families were objects of their own terror and<br>
other people&rsquo;s charity, yet while a penny lasted, nay, even beyond it,<br>
endeavouring to drown themselves, labouring to forget former things,<br>
which now it was the proper time to remember, making more work for<br>
repentance, and sinning on, as a remedy for sin past.<br>
<br>
But it is none of my talent to preach; these men were too wicked, even<br>
for me. There was something horrid and absurd in their way of sinning,<br>
for it was all a force even upon themselves; they did not only act<br>
against conscience, but against nature; they put a rape upon their<br>
temper to drown the reflections, which their circumstances continually<br>
gave them; and nothing was more easy than to see how sighs would<br>
interrupt their songs, and paleness and anguish sit upon their brows,<br>
in spite of the forced smiles they put on; nay, sometimes it would<br>
break out at their very mouths when they had parted with their money<br>
for a lewd treat or a wicked embrace. I have heard them, turning about,<br>
fetch a deep sigh, and cry, &ldquo;What a dog am I! Well, Betty, my dear,<br>
I&rsquo;ll drink thy health, though&rdquo;; meaning the honest wife, that perhaps<br>
had not a half-crown for herself and three or four children. The next<br>
morning they are at their penitentials again; and perhaps the poor<br>
weeping wife comes over to him, either brings him some account of what<br>
his creditors are doing, and how she and the children are turned out of<br>
doors, or some other dreadful news; and this adds to his<br>
self-reproaches; but when he has thought and pored on it till he is<br>
almost mad, having no principles to support him, nothing within him or<br>
above him to comfort him, but finding it all darkness on every side, he<br>
flies to the same relief again, viz. to drink it away, debauch it away,<br>
and falling into company of men in just the same condition with<br>
himself, he repeats the crime, and thus he goes every day one step<br>
onward of his way to destruction.<br>
<br>
I was not wicked enough for such fellows as these yet. On the contrary,<br>
I began to consider here very seriously what I had to do; how things<br>
stood with me, and what course I ought to take. I knew I had no<br>
friends, no, not one friend or relation in the world; and that little I<br>
had left apparently wasted, which when it was gone, I saw nothing but<br>
misery and starving was before me. Upon these considerations, I say,<br>
and filled with horror at the place I was in, and the dreadful objects<br>
which I had always before me, I resolved to be gone.<br>
<br>
I had made an acquaintance with a very sober, good sort of a woman, who<br>
was a widow too, like me, but in better circumstances. Her husband had<br>
been a captain of a merchant ship, and having had the misfortune to be<br>
cast away coming home on a voyage from the West Indies, which would<br>
have been very profitable if he had come safe, was so reduced by the<br>
loss, that though he had saved his life then, it broke his heart, and<br>
killed him afterwards; and his widow, being pursued by the creditors,<br>
was forced to take shelter in the Mint. She soon made things up with<br>
the help of friends, and was at liberty again; and finding that I<br>
rather was there to be concealed, than by any particular prosecutions<br>
and finding also that I agreed with her, or rather she with me, in a<br>
just abhorrence of the place and of the company, she invited to go home<br>
with her till I could put myself in some posture of settling in the<br>
world to my mind; withal telling me, that it was ten to one but some<br>
good captain of a ship might take a fancy to me, and court me, in that<br>
part of the town where she lived.<br>
<br>
I accepted her offer, and was with her half a year, and should have<br>
been longer, but in that interval what she proposed to me happened to<br>
herself, and she married very much to her advantage. But whose fortune<br>
soever was upon the increase, mine seemed to be upon the wane, and I<br>
found nothing present, except two or three boatswains, or such fellows,<br>
but as for the commanders, they were generally of two sorts: 1. Such<br>
as, having good business, that is to say, a good ship, resolved not to<br>
marry but with advantage, that is, with a good fortune; 2. Such as,<br>
being out of employ, wanted a wife to help them to a ship; I mean (1) a<br>
wife who, having some money, could enable them to hold, as they call<br>
it, a good part of a ship themselves, so to encourage owners to come<br>
in; or (2) a wife who, if she had not money, had friends who were<br>
concerned in shipping, and so could help to put the young man into a<br>
good ship, which to them is as good as a portion; and neither of these<br>
was my case, so I looked like one that was to lie on hand.<br>
<br>
This knowledge I soon learned by experience, viz. that the state of<br>
things was altered as to matrimony, and that I was not to expect at<br>
London what I had found in the country: that marriages were here the<br>
consequences of politic schemes for forming interests, and carrying on<br>
business, and that Love had no share, or but very little, in the<br>
matter.<br>
<br>
That as my sister-in-law at Colchester had said, beauty, wit, manners,<br>
sense, good humour, good behaviour, education, virtue, piety, or any<br>
other qualification, whether of body or mind, had no power to<br>
recommend; that money only made a woman agreeable; that men chose<br>
mistresses indeed by the gust of their affection, and it was requisite<br>
to a whore to be handsome, well-shaped, have a good mien and a graceful<br>
behaviour; but that for a wife, no deformity would shock the fancy, no<br>
ill qualities the judgment; the money was the thing; the portion was<br>
neither crooked nor monstrous, but the money was always agreeable,<br>
whatever the wife was.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, as the market ran very unhappily on the men&rsquo;s side,<br>
I found the women had lost the privilege of saying No; that it was a<br>
favour now for a woman to have the Question asked, and if any young<br>
lady had so much arrogance as to counterfeit a negative, she never had<br>
the opportunity given her of denying twice, much less of recovering<br>
that false step, and accepting what she had but seemed to decline. The<br>
men had such choice everywhere, that the case of the women was very<br>
unhappy; for they seemed to ply at every door, and if the man was by<br>
great chance refused at one house, he was sure to be received at the<br>
next.<br>
<br>
Besides this, I observed that the men made no scruple to set themselves<br>
out, and to go a-fortunehunting, as they call it, when they had really<br>
no fortune themselves to demand it, or merit to deserve it; and that<br>
they carried it so high, that a woman was scarce allowed to inquire<br>
after the character or estate of the person that pretended to her. This<br>
I had an example of, in a young lady in the next house to me, and with<br>
whom I had contracted an intimacy; she was courted by a young captain,<br>
and though she had near &pound;2000 to her fortune, she did but inquire of<br>
some of his neighbours about his character, his morals, or substance,<br>
and he took occasion at the next visit to let her know, truly, that he<br>
took it very ill, and that he should not give her the trouble of his<br>
visits any more. I heard of it, and I had begun my acquaintance with<br>
her, I went to see her upon it. She entered into a close conversation<br>
with me about it, and unbosomed herself very freely. I perceived<br>
presently that though she thought herself very ill used, yet she had no<br>
power to resent it, and was exceedingly piqued that she had lost him,<br>
and particularly that another of less fortune had gained him.<br>
<br>
I fortified her mind against such a meanness, as I called it; I told<br>
her, that as low as I was in the world, I would have despised a man<br>
that should think I ought to take him upon his own recommendation only,<br>
without having the liberty to inform myself of his fortune and of his<br>
character; also I told her, that as she had a good fortune, she had no<br>
need to stoop to the disaster of the time; that it was enough that the<br>
men could insult us that had but little money to recommend us, but if<br>
she suffered such an affront to pass upon her without resenting it, she<br>
would be rendered low-prized upon all occasions, and would be the<br>
contempt of all the women in that part of the town; that a woman can<br>
never want an opportunity to be revenged of a man that has used her<br>
ill, and that there were ways enough to humble such a fellow as that,<br>
or else certainly women were the most unhappy creatures in the world.<br>
<br>
I found she was very well pleased with the discourse, and she told me<br>
seriously that she would be very glad to make him sensible of her just<br>
resentment, and either to bring him on again, or have the satisfaction<br>
of her revenge being as public as possible.<br>
<br>
I told her, that if she would take my advice, I would tell her how she<br>
should obtain her wishes in both these things; and that I would engage<br>
to bring the man to her door again, and make him beg to be let in. She<br>
smiled at that, and plainly let me see, that if he came to her door,<br>
her resentment was not so great as to give her leave to let him stand<br>
long there.<br>
<br>
However, she listened very willingly to my offer of advice; so I told<br>
her that the first thing she ought to do was a piece of justice to<br>
herself, namely, that whereas she had been told by several people that<br>
he had reported among the ladies that he had left her, and pretended to<br>
give the advantage of the negative to himself, she should take care to<br>
have it well spread among the women&mdash;which she could not fail of an<br>
opportunity to do in a neighbourhood so addicted to family news as that<br>
she live in was&mdash;that she had inquired into his circumstances, and found<br>
he was not the man as to estate he pretended to be. &ldquo;Let them be told,<br>
madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you had been well informed that he was not the<br>
man that you expected, and that you thought it was not safe to meddle<br>
with him; that you heard he was of an ill temper, and that he boasted<br>
how he had used the women ill upon many occasions, and that<br>
particularly he was debauched in his morals&rdquo;, etc. The last of which,<br>
indeed, had some truth in it; but at the same time I did not find that<br>
she seemed to like him much the worse for that part.<br>
<br>
As I had put this into her head, she came most readily into it.<br>
Immediately she went to work to find instruments, and she had very<br>
little difficulty in the search, for telling her story in general to a<br>
couple of gossips in the neighbourhood, it was the chat of the<br>
tea-table all over that part of the town, and I met with it wherever I<br>
visited; also, as it was known that I was acquainted with the young<br>
lady herself, my opinion was asked very often, and I confirmed it with<br>
all the necessary aggravations, and set out his character in the<br>
blackest colours; but then as a piece of secret intelligence, I added,<br>
as what the other gossips knew nothing of, viz. that I had heard he was<br>
in very bad circumstances; that he was under a necessity of a fortune<br>
to support his interest with the owners of the ship he commanded; that<br>
his own part was not paid for, and if it was not paid quickly, his<br>
owners would put him out of the ship, and his chief mate was likely to<br>
command it, who offered to buy that part which the captain had promised<br>
to take.<br>
<br>
I added, for I confess I was heartily piqued at the rogue, as I called<br>
him, that I had heard a rumour, too, that he had a wife alive at<br>
Plymouth, and another in the West Indies, a thing which they all knew<br>
was not very uncommon for such kind of gentlemen.<br>
<br>
This worked as we both desire it, for presently the young lady next<br>
door, who had a father and mother that governed both her and her<br>
fortune, was shut up, and her father forbid him the house. Also in one<br>
place more where he went, the woman had the courage, however strange it<br>
was, to say No; and he could try nowhere but he was reproached with his<br>
pride, and that he pretended not to give the women leave to inquire<br>
into his character, and the like.<br>
<br>
Well, by this time he began to be sensible of his mistake; and having<br>
alarmed all the women on that side of the water, he went over to<br>
Ratcliff, and got access to some of the ladies there; but though the<br>
young women there too were, according to the fate of the day, pretty<br>
willing to be asked, yet such was his ill-luck, that his character<br>
followed him over the water and his good name was much the same there<br>
as it was on our side; so that though he might have had wives enough,<br>
yet it did not happen among the women that had good fortunes, which was<br>
what he wanted.<br>
<br>
But this was not all; she very ingeniously managed another thing<br>
herself, for she got a young gentleman, who as a relation, and was<br>
indeed a married man, to come and visit her two or three times a week<br>
in a very fine chariot and good liveries, and her two agents, and I<br>
also, presently spread a report all over, that this gentleman came to<br>
court her; that he was a gentleman of a &pound;1000 a year, and that he was<br>
fallen in love with her, and that she was going to her aunt&rsquo;s in the<br>
city, because it was inconvenient for the gentleman to come to her with<br>
his coach in Redriff, the streets being so narrow and difficult.<br>
<br>
This took immediately. The captain was laughed at in all companies, and<br>
was ready to hang himself. He tried all the ways possible to come at<br>
her again, and wrote the most passionate letters to her in the world,<br>
excusing his former rashness; and in short, by great application,<br>
obtained leave to wait on her again, as he said, to clear his<br>
reputation.<br>
<br>
At this meeting she had her full revenge of him; for she told him she<br>
wondered what he took her to be, that she should admit any man to a<br>
treaty of so much consequence as that to marriage, without inquiring<br>
very well into his circumstances; that if he thought she was to be<br>
huffed into wedlock, and that she was in the same circumstances which<br>
her neighbours might be in, viz. to take up with the first good<br>
Christian that came, he was mistaken; that, in a word, his character<br>
was really bad, or he was very ill beholden to his neighbours; and that<br>
unless he could clear up some points, in which she had justly been<br>
prejudiced, she had no more to say to him, but to do herself justice,<br>
and give him the satisfaction of knowing that she was not afraid to say<br>
No, either to him or any man else.<br>
<br>
With that she told him what she had heard, or rather raised herself by<br>
my means, of his character; his not having paid for the part he<br>
pretended to own of the ship he commanded; of the resolution of his<br>
owners to put him out of the command, and to put his mate in his stead;<br>
and of the scandal raised on his morals; his having been reproached<br>
with such-and-such women, and having a wife at Plymouth and in the West<br>
Indies, and the like; and she asked him whether he could deny that she<br>
had good reason, if these things were not cleared up, to refuse him,<br>
and in the meantime to insist upon having satisfaction in points to<br>
significant as they were.<br>
<br>
He was so confounded at her discourse that he could not answer a word,<br>
and she almost began to believe that all was true, by his disorder,<br>
though at the same time she knew that she had been the raiser of all<br>
those reports herself.<br>
<br>
After some time he recovered himself a little, and from that time<br>
became the most humble, the most modest, and most importunate man alive<br>
in his courtship.<br>
<br>
She carried her jest on a great way. She asked him, if he thought she<br>
was so at her last shift that she could or ought to bear such<br>
treatment, and if he did not see that she did not want those who<br>
thought it worth their while to come farther to her than he did;<br>
meaning the gentleman whom she had brought to visit her by way of sham.<br>
<br>
She brought him by these tricks to submit to all possible measures to<br>
satisfy her, as well of his circumstances as of his behaviour. He<br>
brought her undeniable evidence of his having paid for his part of the<br>
ship; he brought her certificates from his owners, that the report of<br>
their intending to remove him from the command of the ship and put his<br>
chief mate in was false and groundless; in short, he was quite the<br>
reverse of what he was before.<br>
<br>
Thus I convinced her, that if the men made their advantage of our sex<br>
in the affair of marriage, upon the supposition of there being such<br>
choice to be had, and of the women being so easy, it was only owing to<br>
this, that the women wanted courage to maintain their ground and to<br>
play their part; and that, according to my Lord Rochester,<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er so ruined but she can<br>
Revenge herself on her undoer, Man.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
After these things this young lady played her part so well, that though<br>
she resolved to have him, and that indeed having him was the main bent<br>
of her design, yet she made his obtaining her be to him the most<br>
difficult thing in the world; and this she did, not by a haughty<br>
reserved carriage, but by a just policy, turning the tables upon him,<br>
and playing back upon him his own game; for as he pretended, by a kind<br>
of lofty carriage, to place himself above the occasion of a character,<br>
and to make inquiring into his character a kind of an affront to him,<br>
she broke with him upon that subject, and at the same time that she<br>
make him submit to all possible inquiry after his affairs, she<br>
apparently shut the door against his looking into her own.<br>
<br>
It was enough to him to obtain her for a wife. As to what she had, she<br>
told him plainly, that as he knew her circumstances, it was but just<br>
she should know his; and though at the same time he had only known her<br>
circumstances by common fame, yet he had made so many protestations of<br>
his passion for her, that he could ask no more but her hand to his<br>
grand request, and the like ramble according to the custom of lovers.<br>
In short, he left himself no room to ask any more questions about her<br>
estate, and she took the advantage of it like a prudent woman, for she<br>
placed part of her fortune so in trustees, without letting him know<br>
anything of it, that it was quite out of his reach, and made him be<br>
very well content with the rest.<br>
<br>
It is true she was pretty well besides, that is to say, she had about<br>
&pound;1400 in money, which she gave him; and the other, after some time, she<br>
brought to light as a perquisite to herself, which he was to accept as<br>
a mighty favour, seeing though it was not to be his, it might ease him<br>
in the article of her particular expenses; and I must add, that by this<br>
conduct the gentleman himself became not only the more humble in his<br>
applications to her to obtain her, but also was much the more an<br>
obliging husband to her when he had her. I cannot but remind the ladies<br>
here how much they place themselves below the common station of a wife,<br>
which, if I may be allowed not to be partial, is low enough already; I<br>
say, they place themselves below their common station, and prepare<br>
their own mortifications, by their submitting so to be insulted by the<br>
men beforehand, which I confess I see no necessity of.<br>
<br>
This relation may serve, therefore, to let the ladies see that the<br>
advantage is not so much on the other side as the men think it is; and<br>
though it may be true that the men have but too much choice among us,<br>
and that some women may be found who will dishonour themselves, be<br>
cheap, and easy to come at, and will scarce wait to be asked, yet if<br>
they will have women, as I may say, worth having, they may find them as<br>
uncomeatable as ever and that those that are otherwise are a sort of<br>
people that have such deficiencies, when had, as rather recommend the<br>
ladies that are difficult than encourage the men to go on with their<br>
easy courtship, and expect wives equally valuable that will come at<br>
first call.<br>
<br>
Nothing is more certain than that the ladies always gain of the men by<br>
keeping their ground, and letting their pretended lovers see they can<br>
resent being slighted, and that they are not afraid of saying No. They,<br>
I observe, insult us mightily with telling us of the number of women;<br>
that the wars, and the sea, and trade, and other incidents have carried<br>
the men so much away, that there is no proportion between the numbers<br>
of the sexes, and therefore the women have the disadvantage; but I am<br>
far from granting that the number of women is so great, or the number<br>
of men so small; but if they will have me tell the truth, the<br>
disadvantage of the women is a terrible scandal upon the men, and it<br>
lies here, and here only; namely, that the age is so wicked, and the<br>
sex so debauched, that, in short, the number of such men as an honest<br>
woman ought to meddle with is small indeed, and it is but here and<br>
there that a man is to be found who is fit for a woman to venture upon.<br>
<br>
But the consequence even of that too amounts to no more than this, that<br>
women ought to be the more nice; for how do we know the just character<br>
of the man that makes the offer? To say that the woman should be the<br>
more easy on this occasion, is to say we should be the forwarder to<br>
venture because of the greatness of the danger, which, in my way of<br>
reasoning, is very absurd.<br>
<br>
On the contrary, the women have ten thousand times the more reason to<br>
be wary and backward, by how much the hazard of being betrayed is the<br>
greater; and would the ladies consider this, and act the wary part,<br>
they would discover every cheat that offered; for, in short, the lives<br>
of very few men nowadays will bear a character; and if the ladies do<br>
but make a little inquiry, they will soon be able to distinguish the<br>
men and deliver themselves. As for women that do not think their own<br>
safety worth their thought, that, impatient of their perfect state,<br>
resolve, as they call it, to take the first good Christian that comes,<br>
that run into matrimony as a horse rushes into the battle, I can say<br>
nothing to them but this, that they are a sort of ladies that are to be<br>
prayed for among the rest of distempered people, and to me they look<br>
like people that venture their whole estates in a lottery where there<br>
is a hundred thousand blanks to one prize.<br>
<br>
No man of common-sense will value a woman the less for not giving up<br>
herself at the first attack, or for accepting his proposal without<br>
inquiring into his person or character; on the contrary, he must think<br>
her the weakest of all creatures in the world, as the rate of men now<br>
goes. In short, he must have a very contemptible opinion of her<br>
capacities, nay, every of her understanding, that, having but one case<br>
of her life, shall call that life away at once, and make matrimony,<br>
like death, be a leap in the dark.<br>
<br>
I would fain have the conduct of my sex a little regulated in this<br>
particular, which is the thing in which, of all the parts of life, I<br>
think at this time we suffer most in; &rsquo;tis nothing but lack of courage,<br>
the fear of not being married at all, and of that frightful state of<br>
life called an old maid, of which I have a story to tell by itself.<br>
This, I say, is the woman&rsquo;s snare; but would the ladies once but get<br>
above that fear and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it<br>
by standing their ground, in a case so absolutely necessary to their<br>
felicity, that by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not<br>
marry so soon as they may do otherwise, they would make themselves<br>
amends by marrying safer. She is always married too soon who gets a bad<br>
husband, and she is never married too late who gets a good one; in a<br>
word, there is no woman, deformity or lost reputation excepted, but if<br>
she manages well, may be married safely one time or other; but if she<br>
precipitates herself, it is ten thousand to one but she is undone.<br>
<br>
But I come now to my own case, in which there was at this time no<br>
little nicety. The circumstances I was in made the offer of a good<br>
husband the most necessary thing in the world to me, but I found soon<br>
that to be made cheap and easy was not the way. It soon began to be<br>
found that the widow had no fortune, and to say this was to say all<br>
that was ill of me, for I began to be dropped in all the discourses of<br>
matrimony. Being well-bred, handsome, witty, modest, and agreeable; all<br>
which I had allowed to my character&mdash;whether justly or no is not the<br>
purpose&mdash;I say, all these would not do without the dross, which way now<br>
become more valuable than virtue itself. In short, the widow, they<br>
said, had no money.<br>
<br>
I resolved, therefore, as to the state of my present circumstances,<br>
that it was absolutely necessary to change my station, and make a new<br>
appearance in some other place where I was not known, and even to pass<br>
by another name if I found occasion.<br>
<br>
I communicated my thoughts to my intimate friend, the captain&rsquo;s lady,<br>
whom I had so faithfully served in her case with the captain, and who<br>
was as ready to serve me in the same kind as I could desire. I made no<br>
scruple to lay my circumstances open to her; my stock was but low, for<br>
I had made but about &pound;540 at the close of my last affair, and I had<br>
wasted some of that; however, I had about &pound;460 left, a great many very<br>
rich clothes, a gold watch, and some jewels, though of no extraordinary<br>
value, and about &pound;30 or &pound;40 left in linen not disposed of.<br>
<br>
My dear and faithful friend, the captain&rsquo;s wife, was so sensible of the<br>
service I had done her in the affair above, that she was not only a<br>
steady friend to me, but, knowing my circumstances, she frequently made<br>
me presents as money came into her hands, such as fully amounted to a<br>
maintenance, so that I spent none of my own; and at last she made this<br>
unhappy proposal to me, viz. that as we had observed, as above, how the<br>
men made no scruple to set themselves out as persons meriting a woman<br>
of fortune, when they had really no fortune of their own, it was but<br>
just to deal with them in their own way and, if it was possible, to<br>
deceive the deceiver.<br>
<br>
The captain&rsquo;s lady, in short, put this project into my head, and told<br>
me if I would be ruled by her I should certainly get a husband of<br>
fortune, without leaving him any room to reproach me with want of my<br>
own. I told her, as I had reason to do, that I would give up myself<br>
wholly to her directions, and that I would have neither tongue to speak<br>
nor feet to step in that affair but as she should direct me, depending<br>
that she would extricate me out of every difficulty she brought me<br>
into, which she said she would answer for.<br>
<br>
The first step she put me upon was to call her cousin, and go to a<br>
relation&rsquo;s house of hers in the country, where she directed me, and<br>
where she brought her husband to visit me; and calling me cousin, she<br>
worked matters so about, that her husband and she together invited me<br>
most passionately to come to town and be with them, for they now live<br>
in a quite different place from where they were before. In the next<br>
place, she tells her husband that I had at least &pound;1500 fortune, and<br>
that after some of my relations I was like to have a great deal more.<br>
<br>
It was enough to tell her husband this; there needed nothing on my<br>
side. I was but to sit still and wait the event, for it presently went<br>
all over the neighbourhood that the young widow at Captain &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s was a<br>
fortune, that she had at least &pound;1500, and perhaps a great deal more,<br>
and that the captain said so; and if the captain was asked at any time<br>
about me, he made no scruple to affirm it, though he knew not one word<br>
of the matter, other than that his wife had told him so; and in this he<br>
thought no harm, for he really believed it to be so, because he had it<br>
from his wife: so slender a foundation will those fellows build upon,<br>
if they do but think there is a fortune in the game. With the<br>
reputation of this fortune, I presently found myself blessed with<br>
admirers enough, and that I had my choice of men, as scarce as they<br>
said they were, which, by the way, confirms what I was saying before.<br>
This being my case, I, who had a subtle game to play, had nothing now<br>
to do but to single out from them all the properest man that might be<br>
for my purpose; that is to say, the man who was most likely to depend<br>
upon the hearsay of a fortune, and not inquire too far into the<br>
particulars; and unless I did this I did nothing, for my case would not<br>
bear much inquiry.<br>
<br>
I picked out my man without much difficulty, by the judgment I made of<br>
his way of courting me. I had let him run on with his protestations and<br>
oaths that he loved me above all the world; that if I would make him<br>
happy, that was enough; all which I knew was upon supposition, nay, it<br>
was upon a full satisfaction, that I was very rich, though I never told<br>
him a word of it myself.<br>
<br>
This was my man; but I was to try him to the bottom, and indeed in that<br>
consisted my safety; for if he baulked, I knew I was undone, as surely<br>
as he was undone if he took me; and if I did not make some scruple<br>
about his fortune, it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine;<br>
and first, therefore, I pretended on all occasions to doubt his<br>
sincerity, and told him, perhaps he only courted me for my fortune. He<br>
stopped my mouth in that part with the thunder of his protestations, as<br>
above, but still I pretended to doubt.<br>
<br>
One morning he pulls off his diamond ring, and writes upon the glass of<br>
the sash in my chamber this line&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You I love, and you alone.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I read it, and asked him to lend me his ring, with which I wrote under<br>
it, thus&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And so in love says every one.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
He takes his ring again, and writes another line thus&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Virtue alone is an estate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I borrowed it again, and I wrote under it&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But money&rsquo;s virtue, gold is fate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
He coloured as red as fire to see me turn so quick upon him, and in a<br>
kind of a rage told me he would conquer me, and writes again thus&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I scorn your gold, and yet I love.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I ventured all upon the last cast of poetry, as you&rsquo;ll see, for I wrote<br>
boldly under his last&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m poor: let&rsquo;s see how kind you&rsquo;ll prove.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
This was a sad truth to me; whether he believed me or no, I could not<br>
tell; I supposed then that he did not. However, he flew to me, took me<br>
in his arms, and, kissing me very eagerly, and with the greatest<br>
passion imaginable, he held me fast till he called for a pen and ink,<br>
and then told me he could not wait the tedious writing on the glass,<br>
but, pulling out a piece of paper, he began and wrote again&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Be mine, with all your poverty.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I took his pen, and followed him immediately, thus&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Yet secretly you hope I lie.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
He told me that was unkind, because it was not just, and that I put him<br>
upon contradicting me, which did not consist with good manners, any<br>
more than with his affection; and therefore, since I had insensibly<br>
drawn him into this poetical scribble, he begged I would not oblige him<br>
to break it off; so he writes again&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Let love alone be our debate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I wrote again&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She loves enough that does not hate.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This he took for a favour, and so laid down the cudgels, that is to<br>
say, the pen; I say, he took if for a favour, and a mighty one it was,<br>
if he had known all. However, he took it as I meant it, that is, to let<br>
him think I was inclined to go on with him, as indeed I had all the<br>
reason in the world to do, for he was the best-humoured, merry sort of<br>
a fellow that I ever met with, and I often reflected on myself how<br>
doubly criminal it was to deceive such a man; but that necessity, which<br>
pressed me to a settlement suitable to my condition, was my authority<br>
for it; and certainly his affection to me, and the goodness of his<br>
temper, however they might argue against using him ill, yet they<br>
strongly argued to me that he would better take the disappointment than<br>
some fiery-tempered wretch, who might have nothing to recommend him but<br>
those passions which would serve only to make a woman miserable all her<br>
days.<br>
<br>
Besides, though I jested with him (as he supposed it) so often about my<br>
poverty, yet, when he found it to be true, he had foreclosed all manner<br>
of objection, seeing, whether he was in jest or in earnest, he had<br>
declared he took me without any regard to my portion, and, whether I<br>
was in jest or in earnest, I had declared myself to be very poor; so<br>
that, in a word, I had him fast both ways; and though he might say<br>
afterwards he was cheated, yet he could never say that I had cheated<br>
him.<br>
<br>
He pursued me close after this, and as I saw there was no need to fear<br>
losing him, I played the indifferent part with him longer than prudence<br>
might otherwise have dictated to me. But I considered how much this<br>
caution and indifference would give me the advantage over him, when I<br>
should come to be under the necessity of owning my own circumstances to<br>
him; and I managed it the more warily, because I found he inferred from<br>
thence, as indeed he ought to do, that I either had the more money or<br>
the more judgment, and would not venture at all.<br>
<br>
I took the freedom one day, after we had talked pretty close to the<br>
subject, to tell him that it was true I had received the compliment of<br>
a lover from him, namely, that he would take me without inquiring into<br>
my fortune, and I would make him a suitable return in this, viz. that I<br>
would make as little inquiry into his as consisted with reason, but I<br>
hoped he would allow me to ask a few questions, which he would answer<br>
or not as he thought fit; and that I would not be offended if he did<br>
not answer me at all; one of these questions related to our manner of<br>
living, and the place where, because I had heard he had a great<br>
plantation in Virginia, and that he had talked of going to live there,<br>
and I told him I did not care to be transported.<br>
<br>
He began from this discourse to let me voluntarily into all his<br>
affairs, and to tell me in a frank, open way all his circumstances, by<br>
which I found he was very well to pass in the world; but that great<br>
part of his estate consisted of three plantations, which he had in<br>
Virginia, which brought him in a very good income, generally speaking,<br>
to the tune of &pound;300, a year, but that if he was to live upon them,<br>
would bring him in four times as much. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;you<br>
shall carry me thither as soon as you please, though I won&rsquo;t tell you<br>
so beforehand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I jested with him extremely about the figure he would make in Virginia;<br>
but I found he would do anything I desired, though he did not seem glad<br>
to have me undervalue his plantations, so I turned my tale. I told him<br>
I had good reason not to go there to live, because if his plantations<br>
were worth so much there, I had not a fortune suitable to a gentleman<br>
of &pound;1200 a year, as he said his estate would be.<br>
<br>
He replied generously, he did not ask what my fortune was; he had told<br>
me from the beginning he would not, and he would be as good as his<br>
word; but whatever it was, he assured me he would never desire me to go<br>
to Virginia with him, or go thither himself without me, unless I was<br>
perfectly willing, and made it my choice.<br>
<br>
All this, you may be sure, was as I wished, and indeed nothing could<br>
have happened more perfectly agreeable. I carried it on as far as this<br>
with a sort of indifferency that he often wondered at, more than at<br>
first, but which was the only support of his courtship; and I mention<br>
it the rather to intimate again to the ladies that nothing but want of<br>
courage for such an indifferency makes our sex so cheap, and prepares<br>
them to be ill-used as they are; would they venture the loss of a<br>
pretending fop now and then, who carries it high upon the point of his<br>
own merit, they would certainly be less slighted, and courted more. Had<br>
I discovered really and truly what my great fortune was, and that in<br>
all I had not full &pound;500 when he expected &pound;1500, yet I had hooked him so<br>
fast, and played him so long, that I was satisfied he would have had me<br>
in my worst circumstances; and indeed it was less a surprise to him<br>
when he learned the truth than it would have been, because having not<br>
the least blame to lay on me, who had carried it with an air of<br>
indifference to the last, he would not say one word, except that indeed<br>
he thought it had been more, but that if it had been less he did not<br>
repent his bargain; only that he should not be able to maintain me so<br>
well as he intended.<br>
<br>
In short, we were married, and very happily married on my side, I<br>
assure you, as to the man; for he was the best-humoured man that every<br>
woman had, but his circumstances were not so good as I imagined, as, on<br>
the other hand, he had not bettered himself by marrying so much as he<br>
expected.<br>
<br>
When we were married, I was shrewdly put to it to bring him that little<br>
stock I had, and to let him see it was no more; but there was a<br>
necessity for it, so I took my opportunity one day when we were alone,<br>
to enter into a short dialogue with him about it. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I,<br>
&ldquo;we have been married a fortnight; is it not time to let you know<br>
whether you have got a wife with something or with nothing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Your own<br>
time for that, my dear,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;I am satisfied that I have got the<br>
wife I love; I have not troubled you much,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with my inquiry<br>
after it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;but I have a great difficulty upon me about it,<br>
which I scarce know how to manage.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, my dear?&rdquo; says he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a little hard upon me, and &rsquo;tis harder upon you. I<br>
am told that Captain &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (meaning my friend&rsquo;s husband) &ldquo;has told you I<br>
had a great deal more money than I ever pretended to have, and I am<br>
sure I never employed him to do so.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Captain &mdash;&mdash; may have told me so, but what then? If you<br>
have not so much, that may lie at his door, but you never told me what<br>
you had, so I have no reason to blame you if you have nothing at all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s is so just,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and so generous, that it makes my having<br>
but a little a double affliction to me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;The less you have, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;the worse for us both; but I<br>
hope your affliction you speak of is not caused for fear I should be<br>
unkind to you, for want of a portion. No, no, if you have nothing, tell<br>
me plainly, and at once; I may perhaps tell the captain he has cheated<br>
me, but I can never say you have cheated me, for did you not give it<br>
under your hand that you were poor? and so I ought to expect you to<br>
be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my dear, I am glad I have not been concerned in<br>
deceiving you before marriage. If I deceive you since, &rsquo;tis ne&rsquo;er the<br>
worse; that I am poor is too true, but not so poor as to have nothing<br>
neither&rdquo;; so I pulled out some bank bills, and gave him about &pound;160.<br>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something, my dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and not quite all neither.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had brought him so near to expecting nothing, by what I had said<br>
before, that the money, though the sum was small in itself, was doubly<br>
welcome to him; he owned it was more than he looked for, and that he<br>
did not question by my discourse to him, but that my fine clothes, gold<br>
watch, and a diamond ring or two, had been all my fortune.<br>
<br>
I let him please himself with that &pound;160 two or three days, and then,<br>
having been abroad that day, and as if I had been to fetch it, I<br>
brought him &pound;100 more home in gold, and told him there was a little<br>
more portion for him; and, in short, in about a week more I brought him<br>
&pound;180 more, and about &pound;60 in linen, which I made him believe I had been<br>
obliged to take with the &pound;100 which I gave him in gold, as a<br>
composition for a debt of &pound;600, being little more than five shillings<br>
in the pound, and overvalued too.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And now, my dear,&rdquo; says I to him, &ldquo;I am very sorry to tell you, that<br>
there is all, and that I have given you my whole fortune.&rdquo; I added,<br>
that if the person who had my &pound;600 had not abused me, I had been worth<br>
&pound;1000 to him, but that as it was, I had been faithful to him, and<br>
reserved nothing to myself, but if it had been more he should have had<br>
it.<br>
<br>
He was so obliged by the manner, and so pleased with the sum, for he<br>
had been in a terrible fright lest it had been nothing at all, that he<br>
accepted it very thankfully. And thus I got over the fraud of passing<br>
for a fortune without money, and cheating a man into marrying me on<br>
pretence of a fortune; which, by the way, I take to be one of the most<br>
dangerous steps a woman can take, and in which she runs the most hazard<br>
of being ill-used afterwards.<br>
<br>
My husband, to give him his due, was a man of infinite good nature, but<br>
he was no fool; and finding his income not suited to the manner of<br>
living which he had intended, if I had brought him what he expected,<br>
and being under a disappointment in his return of his plantations in<br>
Virginia, he discovered many times his inclination of going over to<br>
Virginia, to live upon his own; and often would be magnifying the way<br>
of living there, how cheap, how plentiful, how pleasant, and the like.<br>
<br>
I began presently to understand this meaning, and I took him up very<br>
plainly one morning, and told him that I did so; that I found his<br>
estate turned to no account at this distance, compared to what it would<br>
do if he lived upon the spot, and that I found he had a mind to go and<br>
live there; and I added, that I was sensible he had been disappointed<br>
in a wife, and that finding his expectations not answered that way, I<br>
could do no less, to make him amends, than tell him that I was very<br>
willing to go over to Virginia with him and live there.<br>
<br>
He said a thousand kind things to me upon the subject of my making such<br>
a proposal to him. He told me, that however he was disappointed in his<br>
expectations of a fortune, he was not disappointed in a wife, and that<br>
I was all to him that a wife could be, and he was more than satisfied<br>
on the whole when the particulars were put together, but that this<br>
offer was so kind, that it was more than he could express.<br>
<br>
To bring the story short, we agreed to go. He told me that he had a<br>
very good house there, that it was well furnished, that his mother was<br>
alive and lived in it, and one sister, which was all the relations he<br>
had; that as soon as he came there, his mother would remove to another<br>
house, which was her own for life, and his after her decease; so that I<br>
should have all the house to myself; and I found all this to be exactly<br>
as he had said.<br>
<br>
To make this part of the story short, we put on board the ship which we<br>
went in, a large quantity of good furniture for our house, with stores<br>
of linen and other necessaries, and a good cargo for sale, and away we<br>
went.<br>
<br>
To give an account of the manner of our voyage, which was long and full<br>
of dangers, is out of my way; I kept no journal, neither did my<br>
husband. All that I can say is, that after a terrible passage, frighted<br>
twice with dreadful storms, and once with what was still more terrible,<br>
I mean a pirate who came on board and took away almost all our<br>
provisions; and which would have been beyond all to me, they had once<br>
taken my husband to go along with them, but by entreaties were<br>
prevailed with to leave him;&mdash;I say, after all these terrible things, we<br>
arrived in York River in Virginia, and coming to our plantation, we<br>
were received with all the demonstrations of tenderness and affection,<br>
by my husband&rsquo;s mother, that were possible to be expressed.<br>
<br>
We lived here all together, my mother-in-law, at my entreaty,<br>
continuing in the house, for she was too kind a mother to be parted<br>
with; my husband likewise continued the same as at first, and I thought<br>
myself the happiest creature alive, when an odd and surprising event<br>
put an end to all that felicity in a moment, and rendered my condition<br>
the most uncomfortable, if not the most miserable, in the world.<br>
<br>
My mother was a mighty cheerful, good-humoured old woman&mdash;I may call her<br>
old woman, for her son was above thirty; I say she was very pleasant,<br>
good company, and used to entertain me, in particular, with abundance<br>
of stories to divert me, as well of the country we were in as of the<br>
people.<br>
<br>
Among the rest, she often told me how the greatest part of the<br>
inhabitants of the colony came thither in very indifferent<br>
circumstances from England; that, generally speaking, they were of two<br>
sorts; either, first, such as were brought over by masters of ships to<br>
be sold as servants. &ldquo;Such as we call them, my dear,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but<br>
they are more properly called slaves.&rdquo; Or, secondly, such as are<br>
transported from Newgate and other prisons, after having been found<br>
guilty of felony and other crimes punishable with death.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;When they come here,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;we make no difference; the planters<br>
buy them, and they work together in the field till their time is out.<br>
When &rsquo;tis expired,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;they have encouragement given them to<br>
plant for themselves; for they have a certain number of acres of land<br>
allotted them by the country, and they go to work to clear and cure the<br>
land, and then to plant it with tobacco and corn for their own use; and<br>
as the tradesmen and merchants will trust them with tools and clothes<br>
and other necessaries, upon the credit of their crop before it is<br>
grown, so they again plant every year a little more than the year<br>
before, and so buy whatever they want with the crop that is before<br>
them.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Hence, child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;man a Newgate-bird becomes a great man, and<br>
we have,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;several justices of the peace, officers of<br>
the trained bands, and magistrates of the towns they live in, that have<br>
been burnt in the hand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She was going on with that part of the story, when her own part in it<br>
interrupted her, and with a great deal of good-humoured confidence she<br>
told me she was one of the second sort of inhabitants herself; that she<br>
came away openly, having ventured too far in a particular case, so that<br>
she was become a criminal. &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s the mark of it, child,&rdquo; says<br>
she; and, pulling off her glove, &ldquo;look ye here,&rdquo; says she, turning up<br>
the palm of her hand, and showed me a very fine white arm and hand, but<br>
branded in the inside of the hand, as in such cases it must be.<br>
<br>
This story was very moving to me, but my mother, smiling, said, &ldquo;You<br>
need not think a thing strange, daughter, for as I told you, some of<br>
the best men in this country are burnt in the hand, and they are not<br>
ashamed to own it. There&rsquo;s Major &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;he was an eminent<br>
pickpocket; there&rsquo;s Justice Ba&mdash;&mdash;r, was a shoplifter, and both of them<br>
were burnt in the hand; and I could name you several such as they are.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
We had frequent discourses of this kind, and abundance of instances she<br>
gave me of the like. After some time, as she was telling some stories<br>
of one that was transported but a few weeks ago, I began in an intimate<br>
kind of way to ask her to tell me something of her own story, which she<br>
did with the utmost plainness and sincerity; how she had fallen into<br>
very ill company in London in her young days, occasioned by her mother<br>
sending her frequently to carry victuals and other relief to a<br>
kinswoman of hers who was a prisoner in Newgate, and who lay in a<br>
miserable starving condition, was afterwards condemned to be hanged,<br>
but having got respite by pleading her belly, dies afterwards in the<br>
prison.<br>
<br>
Here my mother-in-law ran out in a long account of the wicked practices<br>
in that dreadful place, and how it ruined more young people than all<br>
the town besides. &ldquo;And child,&rdquo; says my mother, &ldquo;perhaps you may know<br>
little of it, or, it may be, have heard nothing about it; but depend<br>
upon it,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;we all know here that there are more thieves and<br>
rogues made by that one prison of Newgate than by all the clubs and<br>
societies of villains in the nation; &rsquo;tis that cursed place,&rdquo; says my<br>
mother, &ldquo;that half peopled this colony.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Here she went on with her own story so long, and in so particular a<br>
manner, that I began to be very uneasy; but coming to one particular<br>
that required telling her name, I thought I should have sunk down in<br>
the place. She perceived I was out of order, and asked me if I was not<br>
well, and what ailed me. I told her I was so affected with the<br>
melancholy story she had told, and the terrible things she had gone<br>
through, that it had overcome me, and I begged of her to talk no more<br>
of it. &ldquo;Why, my dear,&rdquo; says she very kindly, &ldquo;what need these things<br>
trouble you? These passages were long before your time, and they give<br>
me no trouble at all now; nay, I look back on them with a particular<br>
satisfaction, as they have been a means to bring me to this place.&rdquo;<br>
Then she went on to tell me how she very luckily fell into a good<br>
family, where, behaving herself well, and her mistress dying, her<br>
master married her, by whom she had my husband and his sister, and that<br>
by her diligence and good management after her husband&rsquo;s death, she had<br>
improved the plantations to such a degree as they then were, so that<br>
most of the estate was of her getting, not her husband&rsquo;s, for she had<br>
been a widow upwards of sixteen years.<br>
<br>
I heard this part of the story with very little attention, because I<br>
wanted much to retire and give vent to my passions, which I did soon<br>
after; and let any one judge what must be the anguish of my mind, when<br>
I came to reflect that this was certainly no more or less than my own<br>
mother, and I had now had two children, and was big with another by my<br>
own brother, and lay with him still every night.<br>
<br>
I was now the most unhappy of all women in the world. Oh! had the story<br>
never been told me, all had been well; it had been no crime to have<br>
lain with my husband, since as to his being my relation I had known<br>
nothing of it.<br>
<br>
I had now such a load on my mind that it kept me perpetually waking; to<br>
reveal it, which would have been some ease to me, I could not find<br>
would be to any purpose, and yet to conceal it would be next to<br>
impossible; nay, I did not doubt but I should talk of it in my sleep,<br>
and tell my husband of it whether I would or no. If I discovered it,<br>
the least thing I could expect was to lose my husband, for he was too<br>
nice and too honest a man to have continued my husband after he had<br>
known I had been his sister; so that I was perplexed to the last<br>
degree.<br>
<br>
I leave it to any man to judge what difficulties presented to my view.<br>
I was away from my native country, at a distance prodigious, and the<br>
return to me unpassable. I lived very well, but in a circumstance<br>
insufferable in itself. If I had discovered myself to my mother, it<br>
might be difficult to convince her of the particulars, and I had no way<br>
to prove them. On the other hand, if she had questioned or doubted me,<br>
I had been undone, for the bare suggestion would have immediately<br>
separated me from my husband, without gaining my mother or him, who<br>
would have been neither a husband nor a brother; so that between the<br>
surprise on one hand, and the uncertainty on the other, I had been sure<br>
to be undone.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, as I was but too sure of the fact, I lived therefore<br>
in open avowed incest and whoredom, and all under the appearance of an<br>
honest wife; and though I was not much touched with the crime of it,<br>
yet the action had something in it shocking to nature, and made my<br>
husband, as he thought himself, even nauseous to me.<br>
<br>
However, upon the most sedate consideration, I resolved that it was<br>
absolutely necessary to conceal it all and not make the least discovery<br>
of it either to mother or husband; and thus I lived with the greatest<br>
pressure imaginable for three years more, but had no more children.<br>
<br>
During this time my mother used to be frequently telling me old stories<br>
of her former adventures, which, however, were no ways pleasant to me;<br>
for by it, though she did not tell it me in plain terms, yet I could<br>
easily understand, joined with what I had heard myself, of my first<br>
tutors, that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief; but<br>
I verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both, and that<br>
she was then a very pious, sober, and religious woman.<br>
<br>
Well, let her life have been what it would then, it was certain that my<br>
life was very uneasy to me; for I lived, as I have said, but in the<br>
worst sort of whoredom, and as I could expect no good of it, so really<br>
no good issue came of it, and all my seeming prosperity wore off, and<br>
ended in misery and destruction. It was some time, indeed, before it<br>
came to this, for, but I know not by what ill fate guided, everything<br>
went wrong with us afterwards, and that which was worse, my husband<br>
grew strangely altered, forward, jealous, and unkind, and I was as<br>
impatient of bearing his carriage, as the carriage was unreasonable and<br>
unjust. These things proceeded so far, that we came at last to be in<br>
such ill terms with one another, that I claimed a promise of him, which<br>
he entered willingly into with me when I consented to come from England<br>
with him, viz. that if I found the country not to agree with me, or<br>
that I did not like to live there, I should come away to England again<br>
when I pleased, giving him a year&rsquo;s warning to settle his affairs.<br>
<br>
I say, I now claimed this promise of him, and I must confess I did it<br>
not in the most obliging terms that could be in the world neither; but<br>
I insisted that he treated me ill, that I was remote from my friends,<br>
and could do myself no justice, and that he was jealous without cause,<br>
my conversation having been unblamable, and he having no pretense for<br>
it, and that to remove to England would take away all occasion from<br>
him.<br>
<br>
I insisted so peremptorily upon it, that he could not avoid coming to a<br>
point, either to keep his word with me or to break it; and this,<br>
notwithstanding he used all the skill he was master of, and employed<br>
his mother and other agents to prevail with me to alter my resolutions;<br>
indeed, the bottom of the thing lay at my heart, and that made all his<br>
endeavours fruitless, for my heart was alienated from him as a husband.<br>
I loathed the thoughts of bedding with him, and used a thousand<br>
pretenses of illness and humour to prevent his touching me, fearing<br>
nothing more than to be with child by him, which to be sure would have<br>
prevented, or at least delayed, my going over to England.<br>
<br>
However, at last I put him so out of humour, that he took up a rash and<br>
fatal resolution; in short, I should not go to England; and though he<br>
had promised me, yet it was an unreasonable thing for me to desire it;<br>
that it would be ruinous to his affairs, would unhinge his whole<br>
family, and be next to an undoing him in the world; that therefore I<br>
ought not to desire it of him, and that no wife in the world that<br>
valued her family and her husband&rsquo;s prosperity would insist upon such a<br>
thing.<br>
<br>
This plunged me again, for when I considered the thing calmly, and took<br>
my husband as he really was, a diligent, careful man in the main work<br>
of laying up an estate for his children, and that he knew nothing of<br>
the dreadful circumstances that he was in, I could not but confess to<br>
myself that my proposal was very unreasonable, and what no wife that<br>
had the good of her family at heart would have desired.<br>
<br>
But my discontents were of another nature; I looked upon him no longer<br>
as a husband, but as a near relation, the son of my own mother, and I<br>
resolved somehow or other to be clear of him, but which way I did not<br>
know, nor did it seem possible.<br>
<br>
It is said by the ill-natured world, of our sex, that if we are set on<br>
a thing, it is impossible to turn us from our resolutions; in short, I<br>
never ceased poring upon the means to bring to pass my voyage, and came<br>
that length with my husband at last, as to propose going without him.<br>
This provoked him to the last degree, and he called me not only an<br>
unkind wife, but an unnatural mother, and asked me how I could<br>
entertain such a thought without horror, as that of leaving my two<br>
children (for one was dead) without a mother, and to be brought up by<br>
strangers, and never to see them more. It was true, had things been<br>
right, I should not have done it, but now it was my real desire never<br>
to see them, or him either, any more; and as to the charge of<br>
unnatural, I could easily answer it to myself, while I knew that the<br>
whole relation was unnatural in the highest degree in the world.<br>
<br>
However, it was plain there was no bringing my husband to anything; he<br>
would neither go with me nor let me go without him, and it was quite<br>
out of my power to stir without his consent, as any one that knows the<br>
constitution of the country I was in, knows very well.<br>
<br>
We had many family quarrels about it, and they began in time to grow up<br>
to a dangerous height; for as I was quite estranged from my husband (as<br>
he was called) in affection, so I took no heed to my words, but<br>
sometimes gave him language that was provoking; and, in short, strove<br>
all I could to bring him to a parting with me, which was what above all<br>
things in the world I desired most.<br>
<br>
He took my carriage very ill, and indeed he might well do so, for at<br>
last I refused to bed with him, and carrying on the breach upon all<br>
occasions to extremity, he told me once he thought I was mad, and if I<br>
did not alter my conduct, he would put me under cure; that is to say,<br>
into a madhouse. I told him he should find I was far enough from mad,<br>
and that it was not in his power, or any other villain&rsquo;s, to murder me.<br>
I confess at the same time I was heartily frighted at his thoughts of<br>
putting me into a madhouse, which would at once have destroyed all the<br>
possibility of breaking the truth out, whatever the occasion might be;<br>
for that then no one would have given credit to a word of it.<br>
<br>
This therefore brought me to a resolution, whatever came of it, to lay<br>
open my whole case; but which way to do it, or to whom, was an<br>
inextricable difficulty, and took me many months to resolve. In the<br>
meantime, another quarrel with my husband happened, which came up to<br>
such a mad extreme as almost pushed me on to tell it him all to his<br>
face; but though I kept it in so as not to come to the particulars, I<br>
spoke so much as put him into the utmost confusion, and in the end<br>
brought out the whole story.<br>
<br>
He began with a calm expostulation upon my being so resolute to go to<br>
England; I defended it, and one hard word bringing on another, as is<br>
usual in all family strife, he told me I did not treat him as if he was<br>
my husband, or talk of my children as if I was a mother; and, in short,<br>
that I did not deserve to be used as a wife; that he had used all the<br>
fair means possible with me; that he had argued with all the kindness<br>
and calmness that a husband or a Christian ought to do, and that I made<br>
him such a vile return, that I treated him rather like a dog than a<br>
man, and rather like the most contemptible stranger than a husband;<br>
that he was very loth to use violence with me, but that, in short, he<br>
saw a necessity of it now, and that for the future he should be obliged<br>
to take such measures as should reduce me to my duty.<br>
<br>
My blood was now fired to the utmost, though I knew what he had said<br>
was very true, and nothing could appear more provoked. I told him, for<br>
his fair means and his foul, they were equally contemned by me; that<br>
for my going to England, I was resolved on it, come what would; and<br>
that as to treating him not like a husband, and not showing myself a<br>
mother to my children, there might be something more in it than he<br>
understood at present; but, for his further consideration, I thought<br>
fit to tell him thus much, that he neither was my lawful husband, nor<br>
they lawful children, and that I had reason to regard neither of them<br>
more than I did.<br>
<br>
I confess I was moved to pity him when I spoke it, for he turned pale<br>
as death, and stood mute as one thunderstruck, and once or twice I<br>
thought he would have fainted; in short, it put him in a fit something<br>
like an apoplex; he trembled, a sweat or dew ran off his face, and yet<br>
he was cold as a clod, so that I was forced to run and fetch something<br>
for him to keep life in him. When he recovered of that, he grew sick<br>
and vomited, and in a little after was put to bed, and the next morning<br>
was, as he had been indeed all night, in a violent fever.<br>
<br>
However, it went off again, and he recovered, though but slowly, and<br>
when he came to be a little better, he told me I had given him a mortal<br>
wound with my tongue, and he had only one thing to ask before he<br>
desired an explanation. I interrupted him, and told him I was sorry I<br>
had gone so far, since I saw what disorder it put him into, but I<br>
desired him not to talk to me of explanations, for that would but make<br>
things worse.<br>
<br>
This heightened his impatience, and, indeed, perplexed him beyond all<br>
bearing; for now he began to suspect that there was some mystery yet<br>
unfolded, but could not make the least guess at the real particulars of<br>
it; all that ran in his brain was, that I had another husband alive,<br>
which I could not say in fact might not be true, but I assured him,<br>
however, there was not the least of that in it; and indeed, as to my<br>
other husband, he was effectually dead in law to me, and had told me I<br>
should look on him as such, so I had not the least uneasiness on that<br>
score.<br>
<br>
But now I found the thing too far gone to conceal it much longer, and<br>
my husband himself gave me an opportunity to ease myself of the secret,<br>
much to my satisfaction. He had laboured with me three or four weeks,<br>
but to no purpose, only to tell him whether I had spoken these words<br>
only as the effect of my passion, to put him in a passion, or whether<br>
there was anything of truth in the bottom of them. But I continued<br>
inflexible, and would explain nothing, unless he would first consent to<br>
my going to England, which he would never do, he said, while he lived;<br>
on the other hand, I said it was in my power to make him willing when I<br>
pleased&mdash;nay, to make him entreat me to go; and this increased his<br>
curiosity, and made him importunate to the highest degree, but it was<br>
all to no purpose.<br>
<br>
At length he tells all this story to his mother, and sets her upon me<br>
to get the main secret out of me, and she used her utmost skill with me<br>
indeed; but I put her to a full stop at once by telling her that the<br>
reason and mystery of the whole matter lay in herself, and that it was<br>
my respect to her that had made me conceal it; and that, in short, I<br>
could go no farther, and therefore conjured her not to insist upon it.<br>
<br>
She was struck dumb at this suggestion, and could not tell what to say<br>
or to think; but, laying aside the supposition as a policy of mine,<br>
continued her importunity on account of her son, and, if possible, to<br>
make up the breach between us two. As to that, I told her that it was<br>
indeed a good design in her, but that it was impossible to be done; and<br>
that if I should reveal to her the truth of what she desired, she would<br>
grant it to be impossible, and cease to desire it. At last I seemed to<br>
be prevailed on by her importunity, and told her I dared trust her with<br>
a secret of the greatest importance, and she would soon see that this<br>
was so, and that I would consent to lodge it in her breast, if she<br>
would engage solemnly not to acquaint her son with it without my<br>
consent.<br>
<br>
She was long in promising this part, but rather than not come at the<br>
main secret, she agreed to that too, and after a great many other<br>
preliminaries, I began, and told her the whole story. First I told her<br>
how much she was concerned in all the unhappy breach which had happened<br>
between her son and me, by telling me her own story and her London<br>
name; and that the surprise she saw I was in was upon that occasion.<br>
Then I told her my own story, and my name, and assured her, by such<br>
other tokens as she could not deny, that I was no other, nor more or<br>
less, than her own child, her daughter, born of her body in Newgate;<br>
the same that had saved her from the gallows by being in her belly, and<br>
the same that she left in such-and-such hands when she was transported.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to express the astonishment she was in; she was not<br>
inclined to believe the story, or to remember the particulars, for she<br>
immediately foresaw the confusion that must follow in the family upon<br>
it. But everything concurred so exactly with the stories she had told<br>
me of herself, and which, if she had not told me, she would perhaps<br>
have been content to have denied, that she had stopped her own mouth,<br>
and she had nothing to do but to take me about the neck and kiss me,<br>
and cry most vehemently over me, without speaking one word for a long<br>
time together. At last she broke out: &ldquo;Unhappy child!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;what<br>
miserable chance could bring thee hither? and in the arms of my own<br>
son, too! Dreadful girl,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;why, we are all undone! Married to<br>
thy own brother! Three children, and two alive, all of the same flesh<br>
and blood! My son and my daughter lying together as husband and wife!<br>
All confusion and distraction for ever! Miserable family! what will<br>
become of us? What is to be said? What is to be done?&rdquo; And thus she ran<br>
on for a great while; nor had I any power to speak, or if I had, did I<br>
know what to say, for every word wounded me to the soul. With this kind<br>
of amazement on our thoughts we parted for the first time, though my<br>
mother was more surprised than I was, because it was more news to her<br>
than to me. However, she promised again to me at parting, that she<br>
would say nothing of it to her son, till we had talked of it again.<br>
<br>
It was not long, you may be sure, before we had a second conference<br>
upon the same subject; when, as if she had been willing to forget the<br>
story she had told me of herself, or to suppose that I had forgot some<br>
of the particulars, she began to tell them with alterations and<br>
omissions; but I refreshed her memory and set her to rights in many<br>
things which I supposed she had forgot, and then came in so opportunely<br>
with the whole history, that it was impossible for her to go from it;<br>
and then she fell into her rhapsodies again, and exclamations at the<br>
severity of her misfortunes. When these things were a little over with<br>
her, we fell into a close debate about what should be first done before<br>
we gave an account of the matter to my husband. But to what purpose<br>
could be all our consultations? We could neither of us see our way<br>
through it, nor see how it could be safe to open such a scene to him.<br>
It was impossible to make any judgment, or give any guess at what<br>
temper he would receive it in, or what measures he would take upon it;<br>
and if he should have so little government of himself as to make it<br>
public, we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole<br>
family, and expose my mother and me to the last degree; and if at last<br>
he should take the advantage the law would give him, he might put me<br>
away with disdain and leave me to sue for the little portion that I<br>
had, and perhaps waste it all in the suit, and then be a beggar; the<br>
children would be ruined too, having no legal claim to any of his<br>
effects; and thus I should see him, perhaps, in the arms of another<br>
wife in a few months, and be myself the most miserable creature alive.<br>
<br>
My mother was as sensible of this as I; and, upon the whole, we knew<br>
not what to do. After some time we came to more sober resolutions, but<br>
then it was with this misfortune too, that my mother&rsquo;s opinion and mine<br>
were quite different from one another, and indeed inconsistent with one<br>
another; for my mother&rsquo;s opinion was, that I should bury the whole<br>
thing entirely, and continue to live with him as my husband till some<br>
other event should make the discovery of it more convenient; and that<br>
in the meantime she would endeavour to reconcile us together again, and<br>
restore our mutual comfort and family peace; that we might lie as we<br>
used to do together, and so let the whole matter remain a secret as<br>
close as death. &ldquo;For, child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;we are both undone if it comes<br>
out.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
To encourage me to this, she promised to make me easy in my<br>
circumstances, as far as she was able, and to leave me what she could<br>
at her death, secured for me separately from my husband; so that if it<br>
should come out afterwards, I should not be left destitute, but be able<br>
to stand on my own feet and procure justice from him.<br>
<br>
This proposal did not agree at all with my judgment of the thing,<br>
though it was very fair and kind in my mother; but my thoughts ran<br>
quite another way.<br>
<br>
As to keeping the thing in our own breasts, and letting it all remain<br>
as it was, I told her it was impossible; and I asked her how she could<br>
think I could bear the thoughts of lying with my own brother. In the<br>
next place, I told her that her being alive was the only support of the<br>
discovery, and that while she owned me for her child, and saw reason to<br>
be satisfied that I was so, nobody else would doubt it; but that if she<br>
should die before the discovery, I should be taken for an impudent<br>
creature that had forged such a thing to go away from my husband, or<br>
should be counted crazed and distracted. Then I told her how he had<br>
threatened already to put me into a madhouse, and what concern I had<br>
been in about it, and how that was the thing that drove me to the<br>
necessity of discovering it to her as I had done.<br>
<br>
From all which I told her, that I had, on the most serious reflections<br>
I was able to make in the case, come to this resolution, which I hoped<br>
she would like, as a medium between both, viz. that she should use her<br>
endeavours with her son to give me leave to go to England, as I had<br>
desired, and to furnish me with a sufficient sum of money, either in<br>
goods along with me, or in bills for my support there, all along<br>
suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper to come over<br>
to me.<br>
<br>
That when I was gone, she should then, in cold blood, and after first<br>
obliging him in the solemnest manner possible to secrecy, discover the<br>
case to him, doing it gradually, and as her own discretion should guide<br>
her, so that he might not be surprised with it, and fly out into any<br>
passions and excesses on my account, or on hers; and that she should<br>
concern herself to prevent his slighting the children, or marrying<br>
again, unless he had a certain account of my being dead.<br>
<br>
This was my scheme, and my reasons were good; I was really alienated<br>
from him in the consequences of these things; indeed, I mortally hated<br>
him as a husband, and it was impossible to remove that riveted aversion<br>
I had to him. At the same time, it being an unlawful, incestuous<br>
living, added to that aversion, and though I had no great concern about<br>
it in point of conscience, yet everything added to make cohabiting with<br>
him the most nauseous thing to me in the world; and I think verily it<br>
was come to such a height, that I could almost as willingly have<br>
embraced a dog as have let him offer anything of that kind to me, for<br>
which reason I could not bear the thoughts of coming between the sheets<br>
with him. I cannot say that I was right in point of policy in carrying<br>
it such a length, while at the same time I did not resolve to discover<br>
the thing to him; but I am giving an account of what was, not of what<br>
ought or ought not to be.<br>
<br>
In their directly opposite opinion to one another my mother and I<br>
continued a long time, and it was impossible to reconcile our<br>
judgments; many disputes we had about it, but we could never either of<br>
us yield our own, or bring over the other.<br>
<br>
I insisted on my aversion to lying with my own brother, and she<br>
insisted upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going<br>
from him to England; and in this uncertainty we continued, not<br>
differing so as to quarrel, or anything like it, but so as not to be<br>
able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible breach that<br>
was before us.<br>
<br>
At last I resolved on a desperate course, and told my mother my<br>
resolution, viz. that, in short, I would tell him of it myself. My<br>
mother was frighted to the last degree at the very thoughts of it; but<br>
I bid her be easy, told her I would do it gradually and softly, and<br>
with all the art and good-humour I was mistress of, and time it also as<br>
well as I could, taking him in good-humour too. I told her I did not<br>
question but, if I could be hypocrite enough to feign more affection to<br>
him than I really had, I should succeed in all my design, and we might<br>
part by consent, and with a good agreement, for I might live him well<br>
enough for a brother, though I could not for a husband.<br>
<br>
All this while he lay at my mother to find out, if possible, what was<br>
the meaning of that dreadful expression of mine, as he called it, which<br>
I mentioned before: namely, that I was not his lawful wife, nor my<br>
children his legal children. My mother put him off, told him she could<br>
bring me to no explanations, but found there was something that<br>
disturbed me very much, and she hoped she should get it out of me in<br>
time, and in the meantime recommended to him earnestly to use me more<br>
tenderly, and win me with his usual good carriage; told him of his<br>
terrifying and affrighting me with his threats of sending me to a<br>
madhouse, and the like, and advised him not to make a woman desperate<br>
on any account whatever.<br>
<br>
He promised her to soften his behaviour, and bid her assure me that he<br>
loved me as well as ever, and that he had no such design as that of<br>
sending me to a madhouse, whatever he might say in his passion; also he<br>
desired my mother to use the same persuasions to me too, that our<br>
affections might be renewed, and we might lie together in a good<br>
understanding as we used to do.<br>
<br>
I found the effects of this treaty presently. My husband&rsquo;s conduct was<br>
immediately altered, and he was quite another man to me; nothing could<br>
be kinder and more obliging than he was to me upon all occasions; and I<br>
could do no less than make some return to it, which I did as well as I<br>
could, but it was but in an awkward manner at best, for nothing was<br>
more frightful to me than his caresses, and the apprehensions of being<br>
with child again by him was ready to throw me into fits; and this made<br>
me see that there was an absolute necessity of breaking the case to him<br>
without any more delay, which, however, I did with all the caution and<br>
reserve imaginable.<br>
<br>
He had continued his altered carriage to me near a month, and we began<br>
to live a new kind of life with one another; and could I have satisfied<br>
myself to have gone on with it, I believe it might have continued as<br>
long as we had continued alive together. One evening, as we were<br>
sitting and talking very friendly together under a little awning, which<br>
served as an arbour at the entrance from our house into the garden, he<br>
was in a very pleasant, agreeable humour, and said abundance of kind<br>
things to me relating to the pleasure of our present good agreement,<br>
and the disorders of our past breach, and what a satisfaction it was to<br>
him that we had room to hope we should never have any more of it.<br>
<br>
I fetched a deep sigh, and told him there was nobody in the world could<br>
be more delighted than I was in the good agreement we had always kept<br>
up, or more afflicted with the breach of it, and should be so still;<br>
but I was sorry to tell him that there was an unhappy circumstance in<br>
our case, which lay too close to my heart, and which I knew not how to<br>
break to him, that rendered my part of it very miserable, and took from<br>
me all the comfort of the rest.<br>
<br>
He importuned me to tell him what it was. I told him I could not tell<br>
how to do it; that while it was concealed from him I alone was unhappy,<br>
but if he knew it also, we should be both so; and that, therefore, to<br>
keep him in the dark about it was the kindest thing that I could do,<br>
and it was on that account alone that I kept a secret from him, the<br>
very keeping of which, I thought, would first or last be my<br>
destruction.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to express his surprise at this relation, and the<br>
double importunity which he used with me to discover it to him. He told<br>
me I could not be called kind to him, nay, I could not be faithful to<br>
him if I concealed it from him. I told him I thought so too, and yet I<br>
could not do it. He went back to what I had said before to him, and<br>
told me he hoped it did not relate to what I had said in my passion,<br>
and that he had resolved to forget all that as the effect of a rash,<br>
provoked spirit. I told him I wished I could forget it all too, but<br>
that it was not to be done, the impression was too deep, and I could<br>
not do it: it was impossible.<br>
<br>
He then told me he was resolved not to differ with me in anything, and<br>
that therefore he would importune me no more about it, resolving to<br>
acquiesce in whatever I did or said; only begged I should then agree,<br>
that whatever it was, it should no more interrupt our quiet and our<br>
mutual kindness.<br>
<br>
This was the most provoking thing he could have said to me, for I<br>
really wanted his further importunities, that I might be prevailed with<br>
to bring out that which indeed it was like death to me to conceal; so I<br>
answered him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be<br>
importuned, thought I could not tell how to comply. &ldquo;But come, my<br>
dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what conditions will you make with me upon the opening<br>
this affair to you?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Any conditions in the world,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you can in reason desire<br>
of me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;come, give it me under your hand, that if you<br>
do not find I am in any fault, or that I am willingly concerned in the<br>
causes of the misfortune that is to follow, you will not blame me, use<br>
me the worse, do me any injury, or make me be the sufferer for that<br>
which is not my fault.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the most reasonable demand in the world: not to<br>
blame you for that which is not your fault. Give me a pen and ink,&rdquo;<br>
says he; so I ran in and fetched a pen, ink, and paper, and he wrote<br>
the condition down in the very words I had proposed it, and signed it<br>
with his name. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what is next, my dear?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;the next is, that you will not blame me for not<br>
discovering the secret of it to you before I knew it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Very just again,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;with all my heart&rdquo;; so he wrote down that<br>
also, and signed it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;then I have but one condition more to make<br>
with you, and that is, that as there is nobody concerned in it but you<br>
and I, you shall not discover it to any person in the world, except<br>
your own mother; and that in all the measures you shall take upon the<br>
discovery, as I am equally concerned in it with you, though as innocent<br>
as yourself, you shall do nothing in a passion, nothing to my prejudice<br>
or to your mother&rsquo;s prejudice, without my knowledge and consent.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This a little amazed him, and he wrote down the words distinctly, but<br>
read them over and over before he signed them, hesitating at them<br>
several times, and repeating them: &ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s prejudice! and your<br>
prejudice! What mysterious thing can this be?&rdquo; However, at last he<br>
signed it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;my dear, I&rsquo;ll ask you no more under your hand; but as<br>
you are to hear the most unexpected and surprising thing that perhaps<br>
ever befell any family in the world, I beg you to promise me you will<br>
receive it with composure and a presence of mind suitable to a man of<br>
sense.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my utmost,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;upon condition you will keep me no<br>
longer in suspense, for you terrify me with all these preliminaries.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;it is this: as I told you before in a heat, that<br>
I was not your lawful wife, and that our children were not legal<br>
children, so I must let you know now in calmness and in kindness, but<br>
with affliction enough, that I am your own sister, and you my own<br>
brother, and that we are both the children of our mother now alive, and<br>
in the house, who is convinced of the truth of it, in a manner not to<br>
be denied or contradicted.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I saw him turn pale and look wild; and I said, &ldquo;Now remember your<br>
promise, and receive it with presence of mind; for who could have said<br>
more to prepare you for it than I have done?&rdquo; However, I called a<br>
servant, and got him a little glass of rum (which is the usual dram of<br>
that country), for he was just fainting away. When he was a little<br>
recovered, I said to him, &ldquo;This story, you may be sure, requires a long<br>
explanation, and therefore, have patience and compose your mind to hear<br>
it out, and I&rsquo;ll make it as short as I can&rdquo;; and with this, I told him<br>
what I thought was needful of the fact, and particularly how my mother<br>
came to discover it to me, as above. &ldquo;And now, my dear,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you<br>
will see reason for my capitulations, and that I neither have been the<br>
cause of this matter, nor could be so, and that I could know nothing of<br>
it before now.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am fully satisfied of that,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but &rsquo;tis a dreadful surprise<br>
to me; however, I know a remedy for it all, and a remedy that shall put<br>
an end to your difficulties, without your going to England.&rdquo; &ldquo;That<br>
would be strange,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as all the rest.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll<br>
make it easy; there&rsquo;s nobody in the way of it but myself.&rdquo; He looked a<br>
little disordered when he said this, but I did not apprehend anything<br>
from it at that time, believing, as it used to be said, that they who<br>
do those things never talk of them, or that they who talk of such<br>
things never do them.<br>
<br>
But things were not come to their height with him, and I observed he<br>
became pensive and melancholy; and in a word, as I thought, a little<br>
distempered in his head. I endeavoured to talk him into temper, and to<br>
reason him into a kind of scheme for our government in the affair, and<br>
sometimes he would be well, and talk with some courage about it; but<br>
the weight of it lay too heavy upon his thoughts, and, in short, it<br>
went so far that he made attempts upon himself, and in one of them had<br>
actually strangled himself and had not his mother come into the room in<br>
the very moment, he had died; but with the help of a Negro servant she<br>
cut him down and recovered him.<br>
<br>
Things were now come to a lamentable height in the family. My pity for<br>
him now began to revive that affection which at first I really had for<br>
him, and I endeavoured sincerely, by all the kind carriage I could, to<br>
make up the breach; but, in short, it had gotten too great a head, it<br>
preyed upon his spirits, and it threw him into a long, lingering<br>
consumption, though it happened not to be mortal. In this distress I<br>
did not know what to do, as his life was apparently declining, and I<br>
might perhaps have married again there, very much to my advantage; it<br>
had been certainly my business to have stayed in the country, but my<br>
mind was restless too, and uneasy; I hankered after coming to England,<br>
and nothing would satisfy me without it.<br>
<br>
In short, by an unwearied importunity, my husband, who was apparently<br>
decaying, as I observed, was at last prevailed with; and so my own fate<br>
pushing me on, the way was made clear for me, and my mother concurring,<br>
I obtained a very good cargo for my coming to England.<br>
<br>
When I parted with my brother (for such I am now to call him), we<br>
agreed that after I arrived he should pretend to have an account that I<br>
was dead in England, and so might marry again when he would. He<br>
promised, and engaged to me to correspond with me as a sister, and to<br>
assist and support me as long as I lived; and that if he died before<br>
me, he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still,<br>
in the name of a sister, and he was in some respects careful of me,<br>
when he heard of me; but it was so oddly managed that I felt the<br>
disappointments very sensibly afterwards, as you shall hear in its<br>
time.<br>
<br>
I came away for England in the month of August, after I had been eight<br>
years in that country; and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me,<br>
which perhaps few women have gone through the life of.<br>
<br>
We had an indifferent good voyage till we came just upon the coast of<br>
England, and where we arrived in two-and-thirty days, but were then<br>
ruffled with two or three storms, one of which drove us away to the<br>
coast of Ireland, and we put in at Kinsdale. We remained there about<br>
thirteen days, got some refreshment on shore, and put to sea again,<br>
though we met with very bad weather again, in which the ship sprung her<br>
mainmast, as they called it, for I knew not what they meant. But we got<br>
at last into Milford Haven, in Wales, where, though it was remote from<br>
our port, yet having my foot safe upon the firm ground of my native<br>
country, the isle of Britain, I resolved to venture it no more upon the<br>
waters, which had been so terrible to me; so getting my clothes and<br>
money on shore, with my bills of loading and other papers, I resolved<br>
to come for London, and leave the ship to get to her port as she could;<br>
the port whither she was bound was to Bristol, where my brother&rsquo;s chief<br>
correspondent lived.<br>
<br>
I got to London in about three weeks, where I heard a little while<br>
after that the ship was arrived in Bristol, but at the same time had<br>
the misfortune to know that by the violent weather she had been in, and<br>
the breaking of her mainmast, she had great damage on board, and that a<br>
great part of her cargo was spoiled.<br>
<br>
I had now a new scene of life upon my hands, and a dreadful appearance<br>
it had. I was come away with a kind of final farewell. What I brought<br>
with me was indeed considerable, had it come safe, and by the help of<br>
it, I might have married again tolerably well; but as it was, I was<br>
reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole, and this<br>
without any hope of recruit. I was entirely without friends, nay, even<br>
so much as without acquaintance, for I found it was absolutely<br>
necessary not to revive former acquaintances; and as for my subtle<br>
friend that set me up formerly for a fortune, she was dead, and her<br>
husband also; as I was informed, upon sending a person unknown to<br>
inquire.<br>
<br>
The looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a<br>
journey to Bristol, and during my attendance upon that affair I took<br>
the diversion of going to the Bath, for as I was still far from being<br>
old, so my humour, which was always gay, continued so to an extreme;<br>
and being now, as it were, a woman of fortune though I was a woman<br>
without a fortune, I expected something or other might happen in my way<br>
that might mend my circumstances, as had been my case before.<br>
<br>
The Bath is a place of gallantry enough; expensive, and full of snares.<br>
I went thither, indeed, in the view of taking anything that might<br>
offer, but I must do myself justice, as to protest I knew nothing<br>
amiss; I meant nothing but in an honest way, nor had I any thoughts<br>
about me at first that looked the way which afterwards I suffered them<br>
to be guided.<br>
<br>
Here I stayed the whole latter season, as it is called there, and<br>
contracted some unhappy acquaintances, which rather prompted the<br>
follies I fell afterwards into than fortified me against them. I lived<br>
pleasantly enough, kept good company, that is to say, gay, fine<br>
company; but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me<br>
exceedingly, and that as I had no settled income, so spending upon the<br>
main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death; and this gave<br>
me many sad reflections in the interval of my other thoughts. However,<br>
I shook them off, and still flattered myself that something or other<br>
might offer for my advantage.<br>
<br>
But I was in the wrong place for it. I was not now at Redriff, where,<br>
if I had set myself tolerably up, some honest sea captain or other<br>
might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony; but I<br>
was at the Bath, where men find a mistress sometimes, but very rarely<br>
look for a wife; and consequently all the particular acquaintances a<br>
woman can expect to make there must have some tendency that way.<br>
<br>
I had spent the first season well enough; for though I had contracted<br>
some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the Bath for his<br>
diversion, yet I had entered into no felonious treaty, as it might be<br>
called. I had resisted some casual offers of gallantry, and had managed<br>
that way well enough. I was not wicked enough to come into the crime<br>
for the mere vice of it, and I had no extraordinary offers made me that<br>
tempted me with the main thing which I wanted.<br>
<br>
However, I went this length the first season, viz. I contracted an<br>
acquaintance with a woman in whose house I lodged, who, though she did<br>
not keep an ill house, as we call it, yet had none of the best<br>
principles in herself. I had on all occasions behaved myself so well as<br>
not to get the least slur upon my reputation on any account whatever,<br>
and all the men that I had conversed with were of so good reputation<br>
that I had not given the least reflection by conversing with them; nor<br>
did any of them seem to think there was room for a wicked<br>
correspondence, if they had any of them offered it; yet there was one<br>
gentleman, as above, who always singled me out for the diversion of my<br>
company, as he called it, which, as he was pleased to say, was very<br>
agreeable to him, but at that time there was no more in it.<br>
<br>
I had many melancholy hours at the Bath after the company was gone; for<br>
though I went to Bristol sometime for the disposing my effects, and for<br>
recruits of money, yet I chose to come back to Bath for my residence,<br>
because being on good terms with the woman in whose house I lodged in<br>
the summer, I found that during the winter I lived rather cheaper there<br>
than I could do anywhere else. Here, I say, I passed the winter as<br>
heavily as I had passed the autumn cheerfully; but having contracted a<br>
nearer intimacy with the said woman in whose house I lodged, I could<br>
not avoid communicating to her something of what lay hardest upon my<br>
mind and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances, and the loss<br>
of my fortune by the damage of my goods at sea. I told her also, that I<br>
had a mother and a brother in Virginia in good circumstances; and as I<br>
had really written back to my mother in particular to represent my<br>
condition, and the great loss I had received, which indeed came to<br>
almost &pound;500, so I did not fail to let my new friend know that I<br>
expected a supply from thence, and so indeed I did; and as the ships<br>
went from Bristol to York River, in Virginia, and back again generally<br>
in less time from London, and that my brother corresponded chiefly at<br>
Bristol, I thought it was much better for me to wait here for my<br>
returns than to go to London, where also I had not the least<br>
acquaintance.<br>
<br>
My new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition, and indeed<br>
was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low<br>
a price during the winter, that she convinced me she got nothing by me;<br>
and as for lodging, during the winter I paid nothing at all.<br>
<br>
When the spring season came on, she continued to be as kind to me as<br>
she could, and I lodged with her for a time, till it was found<br>
necessary to do otherwise. She had some persons of character that<br>
frequently lodged in her house, and in particular the gentleman who, as<br>
I said, singled me out for his companion the winter before; and he came<br>
down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants, and<br>
lodged in the same house. I suspected that my landlady had invited him<br>
thither, letting him know that I was still with her; but she denied it,<br>
and protested to me that she did not, and he said the same.<br>
<br>
In a word, this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for<br>
his peculiar confidence as well as conversation. He was a complete<br>
gentleman, that must be confessed, and his company was very agreeable<br>
to me, as mine, if I might believe him, was to him. He made no<br>
professions to me but of an extraordinary respect, and he had such an<br>
opinion of my virtue, that, as he often professed, he believed if he<br>
should offer anything else, I should reject him with contempt. He soon<br>
understood from me that I was a widow; that I had arrived at Bristol<br>
from Virginia by the last ships; and that I waited at Bath till the<br>
next Virginia fleet should arrive, by which I expected considerable<br>
effects. I understood by him, and by others of him, that he had a wife,<br>
but that the lady was distempered in her head, and was under the<br>
conduct of her own relations, which he consented to, to avoid any<br>
reflections that might (as was not unusual in such cases) be cast on<br>
him for mismanaging her cure; and in the meantime he came to the Bath<br>
to divert his thoughts from the disturbance of such a melancholy<br>
circumstance as that was.<br>
<br>
My landlady, who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all<br>
occasions, gave me an advantageous character of him, as a man of honour<br>
and of virtue, as well as of great estate. And indeed I had a great<br>
deal of reason to say so of him too; for though we lodged both on a<br>
floor, and he had frequently come into my chamber, even when I was in<br>
bed, and I also into his when he was in bed, yet he never offered<br>
anything to me further than a kiss, or so much as solicited me to<br>
anything till long after, as you shall hear.<br>
<br>
I frequently took notice to my landlady of his exceeding modesty, and<br>
she again used to tell me, she believed it was so from the beginning;<br>
however, she used to tell me that she thought I ought to expect some<br>
gratification from him for my company, for indeed he did, as it were,<br>
engross me, and I was seldom from him. I told her I had not given him<br>
the least occasion to think I wanted it, or that I would accept of it<br>
from him. She told me she would take that part upon her, and she did<br>
so, and managed it so dexterously, that the first time we were together<br>
alone, after she had talked with him, he began to inquire a little into<br>
my circumstances, as how I had subsisted myself since I came on shore,<br>
and whether I did not want money. I stood off very boldly. I told him<br>
that though my cargo of tobacco was damaged, yet that it was not quite<br>
lost; that the merchant I had been consigned to had so honestly managed<br>
for me that I had not wanted, and that I hoped, with frugal management,<br>
I should make it hold out till more would come, which I expected by the<br>
next fleet; that in the meantime I had retrenched my expenses, and<br>
whereas I kept a maid last season, now I lived without; and whereas I<br>
had a chamber and a dining-room then on the first floor, as he knew, I<br>
now had but one room, two pair of stairs, and the like. &ldquo;But I live,&rdquo;<br>
said I, &ldquo;as well satisfied now as I did then&rdquo;; adding, that his company<br>
had been a means to make me live much more cheerfully than otherwise I<br>
should have done, for which I was much obliged to him; and so I put off<br>
all room for any offer for the present. However, it was not long before<br>
he attacked me again, and told me he found that I was backward to trust<br>
him with the secret of my circumstances, which he was sorry for;<br>
assuring me that he inquired into it with no design to satisfy his own<br>
curiosity, but merely to assist me, if there was any occasion; but<br>
since I would not own myself to stand in need of any assistance, he had<br>
but one thing more to desire of me, and that was, that I would promise<br>
him that when I was any way straitened, or like to be so, I would<br>
frankly tell him of it, and that I would make use of him with the same<br>
freedom that he made the offer; adding, that I should always find I had<br>
a true friend, though perhaps I was afraid to trust him.<br>
<br>
I omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged, to<br>
let him know that I had a due sense of his kindness; and indeed from<br>
that time I did not appear so much reserved to him as I had done<br>
before, though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both<br>
sides; but how free soever our conversation was, I could not arrive to<br>
that sort of freedom which he desired, viz. to tell him I wanted money,<br>
though I was secretly very glad of his offer.<br>
<br>
Some weeks passed after this, and still I never asked him for money;<br>
when my landlady, a cunning creature, who had often pressed me to it,<br>
but found that I could not do it, makes a story of her own inventing,<br>
and comes in bluntly to me when we were together. &ldquo;Oh, widow!&rdquo; says<br>
she, &ldquo;I have bad news to tell you this morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said<br>
I; &ldquo;are the Virginia ships taken by the French?&rdquo;&mdash;for that was my fear.<br>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but the man you sent to Bristol yesterday for<br>
money is come back, and says he has brought none.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Now I could by no means like her project; I thought it looked too much<br>
like prompting him, which indeed he did not want, and I clearly saw<br>
that I should lose nothing by being backward to ask, so I took her up<br>
short. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t image why he should say so to you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I<br>
assure you he brought me all the money I sent him for, and here it is,&rdquo;<br>
said I (pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it); and<br>
added, &ldquo;I intend you shall have most of it by and by.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He seemed distasted a little at her talking as she did at first, as<br>
well as I, taking it, as I fancied he would, as something forward of<br>
her; but when he saw me give such an answer, he came immediately to<br>
himself again. The next morning we talked of it again, when I found he<br>
was fully satisfied, and, smiling, said he hoped I would not want money<br>
and not tell him of it, and that I had promised him otherwise. I told<br>
him I had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady&rsquo;s talking so<br>
publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with; but I<br>
supposed she wanted what I owed her, which was about eight guineas,<br>
which I had resolved to give her, and had accordingly given it her the<br>
same night she talked so foolishly.<br>
<br>
He was in a might good humour when he heard me say I had paid her, and<br>
it went off into some other discourse at that time. But the next<br>
morning, he having heard me up about my room before him, he called to<br>
me, and I answering, he asked me to come into his chamber. He was in<br>
bed when I came in, and he made me come and sit down on his bedside,<br>
for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment.<br>
After some very kind expressions, he asked me if I would be very honest<br>
to him, and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me.<br>
After some little cavil at the word &ldquo;sincere,&rdquo; and asking him if I had<br>
ever given him any answers which were not sincere, I promised him I<br>
would. Why, then, his request was, he said, to let him see my purse. I<br>
immediately put my hand into my pocket, and, laughing to him, pulled it<br>
out, and there was in it three guineas and a half. Then he asked me if<br>
there was all the money I had. I told him No, laughing again, not by a<br>
great deal.<br>
<br>
Well, then, he said, he would have me promise to go and fetch him all<br>
the money I had, every farthing. I told him I would, and I went into my<br>
chamber and fetched him a little private drawer, where I had about six<br>
guineas more, and some silver, and threw it all down upon the bed, and<br>
told him there was all my wealth, honestly to a shilling. He looked a<br>
little at it, but did not tell it, and huddled it all into the drawer<br>
again, and then reaching his pocket, pulled out a key, and bade me open<br>
a little walnut-tree box he had upon the table, and bring him such a<br>
drawer, which I did. In which drawer there was a great deal of money in<br>
gold, I believe near two hundred guineas, but I knew not how much. He<br>
took the drawer, and taking my hand, made me put it in and take a whole<br>
handful. I was backward at that, but he held my hand hard in his hand,<br>
and put it into the drawer, and made me take out as many guineas almost<br>
as I could well take up at once.<br>
<br>
When I had done so, he made me put them into my lap, and took my little<br>
drawer, and poured out all my money among his, and bade me get me gone,<br>
and carry it all home into my own chamber.<br>
<br>
I relate this story the more particularly because of the good-humour<br>
there was in it, and to show the temper with which we conversed. It was<br>
not long after this but he began every day to find fault with my<br>
clothes, with my laces and headdresses, and, in a word, pressed me to<br>
buy better; which, by the way, I was willing enough to do, though I did<br>
not seem to be so, for I loved nothing in the world better than fine<br>
clothes. I told him I must housewife the money he had lent me, or else<br>
I should not be able to pay him again. He then told me, in a few words,<br>
that as he had a sincere respect for me, and knew my circumstances, he<br>
had not lent me that money, but given it me, and that he thought I had<br>
merited it from him by giving him my company so entirely as I had done.<br>
After this he made me take a maid, and keep house, and his friend that<br>
come with him to Bath being gone, he obliged me to diet him, which I<br>
did very willingly, believing, as it appeared, that I should lose<br>
nothing by it, nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account<br>
in it too.<br>
<br>
We had lived thus near three months, when the company beginning to wear<br>
away at the Bath, he talked of going away, and fain he would have me to<br>
go to London with him. I was not very easy in that proposal, not<br>
knowing what posture I was to live in there, or how he might use me.<br>
But while this was in debate he fell very sick; he had gone out to a<br>
place in Somersetshire, called Shepton, where he had some business and<br>
was there taken very ill, and so ill that he could not travel; so he<br>
sent his man back to Bath, to beg me that I would hire a coach and come<br>
over to him. Before he went, he had left all his money and other things<br>
of value with me, and what to do with them I did not know, but I<br>
secured them as well as I could, and locked up the lodgings and went to<br>
him, where I found him very ill indeed; however, I persuaded him to be<br>
carried in a litter to the Bath, where there was more help and better<br>
advice to be had.<br>
<br>
He consented, and I brought him to the Bath, which was about fifteen<br>
miles, as I remember. Here he continued very ill of a fever, and kept<br>
his bed five weeks, all which time I nursed him and tended him myself,<br>
as much and as carefully as if I had been his wife; indeed, if I had<br>
been his wife I could not have done more. I sat up with him so much and<br>
so often, that at last, indeed, he would not let me sit up any longer,<br>
and then I got a pallet-bed into his room, and lay in it just at his<br>
bed&rsquo;s feet.<br>
<br>
I was indeed sensibly affected with his condition, and with the<br>
apprehension of losing such a friend as he was, and was like to be to<br>
me, and I used to sit and cry by him many hours together. However, at<br>
last he grew better, and gave hopes that he would recover, as indeed he<br>
did, though very slowly.<br>
<br>
Were it otherwise than what I am going to say, I should not be backward<br>
to disclose it, as it is apparent I have done in other cases in this<br>
account; but I affirm, that through all this conversation, abating the<br>
freedom of coming into the chamber when I or he was in bed, and abating<br>
the necessary offices of attending him night and day when he was sick,<br>
there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us. Oh<br>
that it had been so to the last!<br>
<br>
After some time he gathered strength and grew well apace, and I would<br>
have removed my pallet-bed, but he would not let me, till he was able<br>
to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him, and then I<br>
removed to my own chamber.<br>
<br>
He took many occasions to express his sense of my tenderness and<br>
concern for him; and when he grew quite well, he made me a present of<br>
fifty guineas for my care and, as he called it, for hazarding my life<br>
to save his.<br>
<br>
And now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection<br>
for me, but all along attested it to be with the utmost reserve for my<br>
virtue and his own. I told him I was fully satisfied of it. He carried<br>
it that length that he protested to me, that if he was naked in bed<br>
with me, he would as sacredly preserve my virtue as he would defend it<br>
if I was assaulted by a ravisher. I believed him, and told him I did<br>
so; but this did not satisfy him, he would, he said, wait for some<br>
opportunity to give me an undoubted testimony of it.<br>
<br>
It was a great while after this that I had occasion, on my own<br>
business, to go to Bristol, upon which he hired me a coach, and would<br>
go with me, and did so; and now indeed our intimacy increased. From<br>
Bristol he carried me to Gloucester, which was merely a journey of<br>
pleasure, to take the air; and here it was our hap to have no lodging<br>
in the inn but in one large chamber with two beds in it. The master of<br>
the house going up with us to show his rooms, and coming into that<br>
room, said very frankly to him, &ldquo;Sir, it is none of my business to<br>
inquire whether the lady be your spouse or no, but if not, you may lie<br>
as honestly in these two beds as if you were in two chambers,&rdquo; and with<br>
that he pulls a great curtain which drew quite across the room and<br>
effectually divided the beds. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says my friend, very readily,<br>
&ldquo;these beds will do, and as for the rest, we are too near akin to lie<br>
together, though we may lodge near one another&rdquo;; and this put an honest<br>
face on the thing too. When we came to go to bed, he decently went out<br>
of the room till I was in bed, and then went to bed in the bed on his<br>
own side of the room, but lay there talking to me a great while.<br>
<br>
At last, repeating his usual saying, that he could lie naked in the bed<br>
with me and not offer me the least injury, he starts out of his bed.<br>
&ldquo;And now, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you shall see how just I will be to you,<br>
and that I can keep my word,&rdquo; and away he comes to my bed.<br>
<br>
I resisted a little, but I must confess I should not have resisted him<br>
much if he had not made those promises at all; so after a little<br>
struggle, as I said, I lay still and let him come to bed. When he was<br>
there he took me in his arms, and so I lay all night with him, but he<br>
had no more to do with me, or offered anything to me, other than<br>
embracing me, as I say, in his arms, no, not the whole night, but rose<br>
up and dressed him in the morning, and left me as innocent for him as I<br>
was the day I was born.<br>
<br>
This was a surprising thing to me, and perhaps may be so to others, who<br>
know how the laws of nature work; for he was a strong, vigorous, brisk<br>
person; nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all, but of<br>
mere affection; insisting on it, that though I was to him the most<br>
agreeable woman in the world, yet, because he loved me, he could not<br>
injure me.<br>
<br>
I own it was a noble principle, but as it was what I never understood<br>
before, so it was to me perfectly amazing. We traveled the rest of the<br>
journey as we did before, and came back to the Bath, where, as he had<br>
opportunity to come to me when he would, he often repeated the<br>
moderation, and I frequently lay with him, and he with me, and although<br>
all the familiarities between man and wife were common to us, yet he<br>
never once offered to go any farther, and he valued himself much upon<br>
it. I do not say that I was so wholly pleased with it as he thought I<br>
was, for I own much wickeder than he, as you shall hear presently.<br>
<br>
We lived thus near two years, only with this exception, that he went<br>
three times to London in that time, and once he continued there four<br>
months; but, to do him justice, he always supplied me with money to<br>
subsist me very handsomely.<br>
<br>
Had we continued thus, I confess we had had much to boast of; but as<br>
wise men say, it is ill venturing too near the brink of a command, so<br>
we found it; and here again I must do him the justice to own that the<br>
first breach was not on his part. It was one night that we were in bed<br>
together warm and merry, and having drunk, I think, a little more wine<br>
that night, both of us, than usual, although not in the least to<br>
disorder either of us, when, after some other follies which I cannot<br>
name, and being clasped close in his arms, I told him (I repeat it with<br>
shame and horror of soul) that I could find in my heart to discharge<br>
him of his engagement for one night and no more.<br>
<br>
He took me at my word immediately, and after that there was no<br>
resisting him; neither indeed had I any mind to resist him any more,<br>
let what would come of it.<br>
<br>
Thus the government of our virtue was broken, and I exchanged the place<br>
of friend for that unmusical, harsh-sounding title of whore. In the<br>
morning we were both at our penitentials; I cried very heartily, he<br>
expressed himself very sorry; but that was all either of us could do at<br>
that time, and the way being thus cleared, and the bars of virtue and<br>
conscience thus removed, we had the less difficult afterwards to<br>
struggle with.<br>
<br>
It was but a dull kind of conversation that we had together for all the<br>
rest of that week; I looked on him with blushes, and every now and then<br>
started that melancholy objection, &ldquo;What if I should be with child now?<br>
What will become of me then?&rdquo; He encouraged me by telling me, that as<br>
long as I was true to him, he would be so to me; and since it was gone<br>
such a length (which indeed he never intended), yet if I was with<br>
child, he would take care of that, and of me too. This hardened us<br>
both. I assured him if I was with child, I would die for want of a<br>
midwife rather than name him as the father of it; and he assured me I<br>
should never want if I should be with child. These mutual assurances<br>
hardened us in the thing, and after this we repeated the crime as often<br>
as we pleased, till at length, as I had feared, so it came to pass, and<br>
I was indeed with child.<br>
<br>
After I was sure it was so, and I had satisfied him of it too, we began<br>
to think of taking measures for the managing it, and I proposed<br>
trusting the secret to my landlady, and asking her advice, which he<br>
agreed to. My landlady, a woman (as I found) used to such things, made<br>
light of it; she said she knew it would come to that at last, and made<br>
us very merry about it. As I said above, we found her an experienced<br>
old lady at such work; she undertook everything, engaged to procure a<br>
midwife and a nurse, to satisfy all inquiries, and bring us off with<br>
reputation, and she did so very dexterously indeed.<br>
<br>
When I grew near my time she desired my gentleman to go away to London,<br>
or make as if he did so. When he was gone, she acquainted the parish<br>
officers that there was a lady ready to lie in at her house, but that<br>
she knew her husband very well, and gave them, as she pretended, an<br>
account of his name, which she called Sir Walter Cleve; telling them he<br>
was a very worthy gentleman, and that she would answer for all<br>
inquiries, and the like. This satisfied the parish officers presently,<br>
and I lay in with as much credit as I could have done if I had really<br>
been my Lady Cleve, and was assisted in my travail by three or four of<br>
the best citizens&rsquo; wives of Bath who lived in the neighbourhood, which,<br>
however, made me a little the more expensive to him. I often expressed<br>
my concern to him about it, but he bid me not be concerned at it.<br>
<br>
As he had furnished me very sufficiently with money for the<br>
extraordinary expenses of my lying in, I had everything very handsome<br>
about me, but did not affect to be gay or extravagant neither; besides,<br>
knowing my own circumstances, and knowing the world as I had done, and<br>
that such kind of things do not often last long, I took care to lay up<br>
as much money as I could for a wet day, as I called it; making him<br>
believe it was all spent upon the extraordinary appearance of things in<br>
my lying in.<br>
<br>
By this means, and including what he had given me as above, I had at<br>
the end of my lying in about two hundred guineas by me, including also<br>
what was left of my own.<br>
<br>
I was brought to bed of a fine boy indeed, and a charming child it was;<br>
and when he heard of it he wrote me a very kind, obliging letter about<br>
it, and then told me, he thought it would look better for me to come<br>
away for London as soon as I was up and well; that he had provided<br>
apartments for me at Hammersmith, as if I came thither only from<br>
London; and that after a little while I should go back to the Bath, and<br>
he would go with me.<br>
<br>
I liked this offer very well, and accordingly hired a coach on purpose,<br>
and taking my child, and a wet-nurse to tend and suckle it, and a<br>
maid-servant with me, away I went for London.<br>
<br>
He met me at Reading in his own chariot, and taking me into that, left<br>
the servant and the child in the hired coach, and so he brought me to<br>
my new lodgings at Hammersmith; with which I had abundance of reason to<br>
be very well pleased, for they were very handsome rooms, and I was very<br>
well accommodated.<br>
<br>
And now I was indeed in the height of what I might call my prosperity,<br>
and I wanted nothing but to be a wife, which, however, could not be in<br>
this case, there was no room for it; and therefore on all occasions I<br>
studied to save what I could, as I have said above, against a time of<br>
scarcity, knowing well enough that such things as these do not always<br>
continue; that men that keep mistresses often change them, grow weary<br>
of them, or jealous of them, or something or other happens to make them<br>
withdraw their bounty; and sometimes the ladies that are thus well used<br>
are not careful by a prudent conduct to preserve the esteem of their<br>
persons, or the nice article of their fidelity, and then they are<br>
justly cast off with contempt.<br>
<br>
But I was secured in this point, for as I had no inclination to change,<br>
so I had no manner of acquaintance in the whole house, and so no<br>
temptation to look any farther. I kept no company but in the family<br>
when I lodged, and with the clergyman&rsquo;s lady at next door; so that when<br>
he was absent I visited nobody, nor did he ever find me out of my<br>
chamber or parlour whenever he came down; if I went anywhere to take<br>
the air, it was always with him.<br>
<br>
The living in this manner with him, and his with me, was certainly the<br>
most undesigned thing in the world; he often protested to me, that when<br>
he became first acquainted with me, and even to the very night when we<br>
first broke in upon our rules, he never had the least design of lying<br>
with me; that he always had a sincere affection for me, but not the<br>
least real inclination to do what he had done. I assured him I never<br>
suspected him; that if I had I should not so easily have yielded to the<br>
freedom which brought it on, but that it was all a surprise, and was<br>
owing to the accident of our having yielded too far to our mutual<br>
inclinations that night; and indeed I have often observed since, and<br>
leave it as a caution to the readers of this story, that we ought to be<br>
cautious of gratifying our inclinations in loose and lewd freedoms,<br>
lest we find our resolutions of virtue fail us in the junction when<br>
their assistance should be most necessary.<br>
<br>
It is true, and I have confessed it before, that from the first hour I<br>
began to converse with him, I resolved to let him lie with me, if he<br>
offered it; but it was because I wanted his help and assistance, and I<br>
knew no other way of securing him than that. But when we were that<br>
night together, and, as I have said, had gone such a length, I found my<br>
weakness; the inclination was not to be resisted, but I was obliged to<br>
yield up all even before he asked it.<br>
<br>
However, he was so just to me that he never upbraided me with that; nor<br>
did he ever express the least dislike of my conduct on any other<br>
occasion, but always protested he was as much delighted with my company<br>
as he was the first hour we came together: I mean, came together as<br>
bedfellows.<br>
<br>
It is true that he had no wife, that is to say, she was as no wife to<br>
him, and so I was in no danger that way, but the just reflections of<br>
conscience oftentimes snatch a man, especially a man of sense, from the<br>
arms of a mistress, as it did him at last, though on another occasion.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, though I was not without secret reproaches of my own<br>
conscience for the life I led, and that even in the greatest height of<br>
the satisfaction I ever took, yet I had the terrible prospect of<br>
poverty and starving, which lay on me as a frightful spectre, so that<br>
there was no looking behind me. But as poverty brought me into it, so<br>
fear of poverty kept me in it, and I frequently resolved to leave it<br>
quite off, if I could but come to lay up money enough to maintain me.<br>
But these were thoughts of no weight, and whenever he came to me they<br>
vanished; for his company was so delightful, that there was no being<br>
melancholy when he was there; the reflections were all the subject of<br>
those hours when I was alone.<br>
<br>
I lived six years in this happy but unhappy condition, in which time I<br>
brought him three children, but only the first of them lived; and<br>
though I removed twice in those six years, yet I came back the sixth<br>
year to my first lodgings at Hammersmith. Here it was that I was one<br>
morning surprised with a kind but melancholy letter from my gentleman,<br>
intimating that he was very ill, and was afraid he should have another<br>
fit of sickness, but that his wife&rsquo;s relations being in the house with<br>
him, it would not be practicable to have me with him, which, however,<br>
he expressed his great dissatisfaction in, and that he wished I could<br>
be allowed to tend and nurse him as I did before.<br>
<br>
I was very much concerned at this account, and was very impatient to<br>
know how it was with him. I waited a fortnight or thereabouts, and<br>
heard nothing, which surprised me, and I began to be very uneasy<br>
indeed. I think, I may say, that for the next fortnight I was near to<br>
distracted. It was my particular difficulty that I did not know<br>
directly where he was; for I understood at first he was in the lodgings<br>
of his wife&rsquo;s mother; but having removed myself to London, I soon<br>
found, by the help of the direction I had for writing my letters to<br>
him, how to inquire after him, and there I found that he was at a house<br>
in Bloomsbury, whither he had, a little before he fell sick, removed<br>
his whole family; and that his wife and wife&rsquo;s mother were in the same<br>
house, though the wife was not suffered to know that she was in the<br>
same house with her husband.<br>
<br>
Here I also soon understood that he was at the last extremity, which<br>
made me almost at the last extremity too, to have a true account. One<br>
night I had the curiosity to disguise myself like a servant-maid, in a<br>
round cap and straw hat, and went to the door, as sent by a lady of his<br>
neighbourhood, where he lived before, and giving master and mistress&rsquo;s<br>
service, I said I was sent to know how Mr. &mdash;&mdash; did, and how he had<br>
rested that night. In delivering this message I got the opportunity I<br>
desired; for, speaking with one of the maids, I held a long gossip&rsquo;s<br>
tale with her, and had all the particulars of his illness, which I<br>
found was a pleurisy, attended with a cough and a fever. She told me<br>
also who was in the house, and how his wife was, who, by her relation,<br>
they were in some hopes might recover her understanding; but as to the<br>
gentleman himself, in short she told me the doctors said there was very<br>
little hopes of him, that in the morning they thought he had been<br>
dying, and that he was but little better then, for they did not expect<br>
that he could live over the next night.<br>
<br>
This was heavy news for me, and I began now to see an end of my<br>
prosperity, and to see also that it was very well I had played to good<br>
housewife, and secured or saved something while he was alive, for that<br>
now I had no view of my own living before me.<br>
<br>
It lay very heavy upon my mind, too, that I had a son, a fine lovely<br>
boy, about five years old, and no provision made for it, at least that<br>
I knew of. With these considerations, and a sad heart, I went home that<br>
evening, and began to cast with myself how I should live, and in what<br>
manner to bestow myself, for the residue of my life.<br>
<br>
You may be sure I could not rest without inquiring again very quickly<br>
what was become of him; and not venturing to go myself, I sent several<br>
sham messengers, till after a fortnight&rsquo;s waiting longer, I found that<br>
there was hopes of his life, though he was still very ill; then I<br>
abated my sending any more to the house, and in some time after I<br>
learned in the neighbourhood that he was about house, and then that he<br>
was abroad again.<br>
<br>
I made no doubt then but that I should soon hear of him, and began to<br>
comfort myself with my circumstances being, as I thought, recovered. I<br>
waited a week, and two weeks, and with much surprise and amazement I<br>
waited near two months and heard nothing, but that, being recovered, he<br>
was gone into the country for the air, and for the better recovery<br>
after his distemper. After this it was yet two months more, and then I<br>
understood he was come to his city house again, but still I heard<br>
nothing from him.<br>
<br>
I had written several letters for him, and directed them as usual, and<br>
found two or three of them had been called for, but not the rest. I<br>
wrote again in a more pressing manner than ever, and in one of them let<br>
him know, that I must be forced to wait on him myself, representing my<br>
circumstances, the rent of lodgings to pay, and the provision for the<br>
child wanting, and my own deplorable condition, destitute of<br>
subsistence for his most solemn engagement to take care of and provide<br>
for me. I took a copy of this letter, and finding it lay at the house<br>
near a month and was not called for, I found means to have the copy of<br>
it put into his own hands at a coffee-house, where I had by inquiry<br>
found he used to go.<br>
<br>
This letter forced an answer from him, by which, though I found I was<br>
to be abandoned, yet I found he had sent a letter to me some time<br>
before, desiring me to go down to the Bath again. Its contents I shall<br>
come to presently.<br>
<br>
It is true that sick-beds are the time when such correspondences as<br>
this are looked on with different countenances, and seen with other<br>
eyes than we saw them with, or than they appeared with before. My lover<br>
had been at the gates of death, and at the very brink of eternity; and,<br>
it seems, had been struck with a due remorse, and with sad reflections<br>
upon his past life of gallantry and levity; and among the rest,<br>
criminal correspondence with me, which was neither more nor less than a<br>
long-continued life of adultery, and represented itself as it really<br>
was, not as it had been formerly thought by him to be, and he looked<br>
upon it now with a just and religious abhorrence.<br>
<br>
I cannot but observe also, and leave it for the direction of my sex in<br>
such cases of pleasure, that whenever sincere repentance succeeds such<br>
a crime as this, there never fails to attend a hatred of the object;<br>
and the more the affection might seem to be before, the hatred will be<br>
the more in proportion. It will always be so, indeed it can be no<br>
otherwise; for there cannot be a true and sincere abhorrence of the<br>
offence, and the love to the cause of it remain; there will, with an<br>
abhorrence of the sin, be found a detestation of the fellow-sinner; you<br>
can expect no other.<br>
<br>
I found it so here, though good manners and justice in this gentleman<br>
kept him from carrying it on to any extreme but the short history of<br>
his part in this affair was thus: he perceived by my last letter, and<br>
by all the rest, which he went for after, that I was not gone to Bath,<br>
that his first letter had not come to my hand; upon which he write me<br>
this following:&mdash;<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;MADAM,&mdash;I am surprised that my letter, dated the 8th of last month,<br>
 did not come to your hand; I give you my word it was delivered at<br>
 your lodgings, and to the hands of your maid.<br>
<br>
 I need not acquaint you with what has been my condition for some<br>
 time past; and how, having been at the edge of the grave, I am, by<br>
 the unexpected and undeserved mercy of Heaven, restored again. In<br>
 the condition I have been in, it cannot be strange to you that our<br>
 unhappy correspondence had not been the least of the burthens which<br>
 lay upon my conscience. I need say no more; those things that must<br>
 be repented of, must be also reformed.<br>
<br>
 I wish you would think of going back to the Bath. I enclose you<br>
 here a bill for &pound;50 for clearing yourself at your lodgings, and<br>
 carrying you down, and hope it will be no surprise to you to add,<br>
 that on this account only, and not for any offence given me on your<br>
 side, I can _see you no more_. I will take due care of the child;<br>
 leave him where he is, or take him with you, as you please. I wish<br>
 you the like reflections, and that they may be to your advantage.&mdash;I<br>
 am,&rdquo; etc.<br>
<br>
I was struck with this letter as with a thousand wounds, such as I<br>
cannot describe; the reproaches of my own conscience were such as I<br>
cannot express, for I was not blind to my own crime; and I reflected<br>
that I might with less offence have continued with my brother, and<br>
lived with him as a wife, since there was no crime in our marriage on<br>
that score, neither of us knowing it.<br>
<br>
But I never once reflected that I was all this while a married woman, a<br>
wife to Mr. &mdash;&mdash; the linen-draper, who, though he had left me by the<br>
necessity of his circumstances, had no power to discharge me from the<br>
marriage contract which was between us, or to give me a legal liberty<br>
to marry again; so that I had been no less than a whore and an<br>
adulteress all this while. I then reproached myself with the liberties<br>
I had taken, and how I had been a snare to this gentleman, and that<br>
indeed I was principal in the crime; that now he was mercifully<br>
snatched out of the gulf by a convincing work upon his mind, but that I<br>
was left as if I was forsaken of God&rsquo;s grace, and abandoned by Heaven<br>
to a continuing in my wickedness.<br>
<br>
Under these reflections I continued very pensive and sad for near<br>
month, and did not go down to the Bath, having no inclination to be<br>
with the woman whom I was with before; lest, as I thought, she should<br>
prompt me to some wicked course of life again, as she had done; and<br>
besides, I was very loth she should know I was cast off as above.<br>
<br>
And now I was greatly perplexed about my little boy. It was death to me<br>
to part with the child, and yet when I considered the danger of being<br>
one time or other left with him to keep without a maintenance to<br>
support him, I then resolved to leave him where he was; but then I<br>
concluded also to be near him myself too, that I then might have the<br>
satisfaction of seeing him, without the care of providing for him.<br>
<br>
I sent my gentleman a short letter, therefore, that I had obeyed his<br>
orders in all things but that of going back to the Bath, which I could<br>
not think of for many reasons; that however parting from him was a<br>
wound to me that I could never recover, yet that I was fully satisfied<br>
his reflections were just, and would be very far from desiring to<br>
obstruct his reformation or repentance.<br>
<br>
Then I represented my own circumstances to him in the most moving terms<br>
that I was able. I told him that those unhappy distresses which first<br>
moved him to a generous and an honest friendship for me, would, I hope,<br>
move him to a little concern for me now, though the criminal part of<br>
our correspondence, which I believed neither of us intended to fall<br>
into at the time, was broken off; that I desired to repent as sincerely<br>
as he had done, but entreated him to put me in some condition that I<br>
might not be exposed to the temptations which the devil never fails to<br>
excite us to from the frightful prospect of poverty and distress; and<br>
if he had the least apprehensions of my being troublesome to him, I<br>
begged he would put me in a posture to go back to my mother in<br>
Virginia, from when he knew I came, and that would put an end to all<br>
his fears on that account. I concluded, that if he would send me &pound;50<br>
more to facilitate my going away, I would send him back a general<br>
release, and would promise never to disturb him more with any<br>
importunities; unless it was to hear of the well-doing of the child,<br>
whom, if I found my mother living and my circumstances able, I would<br>
send for to come over to me, and take him also effectually off his<br>
hands.<br>
<br>
This was indeed all a cheat thus far, viz. that I had no intention to<br>
go to Virginia, as the account of my former affairs there may convince<br>
anybody of; but the business was to get this last &pound;50 of him, if<br>
possible, knowing well enough it would be the last penny I was ever to<br>
expect.<br>
<br>
However, the argument I used, namely, of giving him a general release,<br>
and never troubling him any more, prevailed effectually with him, and<br>
he sent me a bill for the money by a person who brought with him a<br>
general release for me to sign, and which I frankly signed, and<br>
received the money; and thus, though full sore against my will, a final<br>
end was put to this affair.<br>
<br>
And here I cannot but reflect upon the unhappy consequence of too great<br>
freedoms between persons stated as we were, upon the pretence of<br>
innocent intentions, love of friendship, and the like; for the flesh<br>
has generally so great a share in those friendships, that is great odds<br>
but inclination prevails at last over the most solemn resolutions; and<br>
that vice breaks in at the breaches of decency, which really innocent<br>
friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness. But I leave<br>
the readers of these things to their own just reflections, which they<br>
will be more able to make effectual than I, who so soon forgot myself,<br>
and am therefore but a very indifferent monitor.<br>
<br>
I was now a single person again, as I may call myself; I was loosed<br>
from all the obligations either of wedlock or mistress-ship in the<br>
world, except my husband the linen-draper, whom, I having not now heard<br>
from in almost fifteen years, nobody could blame me for thinking myself<br>
entirely freed from; seeing also he had at his going away told me, that<br>
if I did not hear frequently from him, I should conclude he was dead,<br>
and I might freely marry again to whom I pleased.<br>
<br>
I now began to cast up my accounts. I had by many letters and much<br>
importunity, and with the intercession of my mother too, had a second<br>
return of some goods from my brother (as I now call him) in Virginia,<br>
to make up the damage of the cargo I brought away with me, and this too<br>
was upon the condition of my sealing a general release to him, and to<br>
send it him by his correspondent at Bristol, which, though I thought<br>
hard of, yet I was obliged to promise to do. However, I managed so well<br>
in this case, that I got my goods away before the release was signed,<br>
and then I always found something or other to say to evade the thing,<br>
and to put off the signing it at all; till at length I pretended I must<br>
write to my brother, and have his answer, before I could do it.<br>
<br>
Including this recruit, and before I got the last &pound;50, I found my<br>
strength to amount, put all together, to about &pound;400, so that with that<br>
I had about &pound;450. I had saved above &pound;100 more, but I met with a<br>
disaster with that, which was this&mdash;that a goldsmith in whose hands I<br>
had trusted it, broke, so I lost &pound;70 of my money, the man&rsquo;s composition<br>
not making above &pound;30 out of his &pound;100. I had a little plate, but not<br>
much, and was well enough stocked with clothes and linen.<br>
<br>
With this stock I had the world to begin again; but you are to consider<br>
that I was not now the same woman as when I lived at Redriff; for,<br>
first of all, I was near twenty years older, and did not look the<br>
better for my age, nor for my rambles to Virginia and back again; and<br>
though I omitted nothing that might set me out to advantage, except<br>
painting, for that I never stooped to, and had pride enough to think I<br>
did not want it, yet there would always be some difference seen between<br>
five-and-twenty and two-and-forty.<br>
<br>
I cast about innumerable ways for my future state of life, and began to<br>
consider very seriously what I should do, but nothing offered. I took<br>
care to make the world take me for something more than I was, and had<br>
it given out that I was a fortune, and that my estate was in my own<br>
hands; the last of which was very true, the first of it was as above. I<br>
had no acquaintance, which was one of my worst misfortunes, and the<br>
consequence of that was, I had no adviser, at least who could assist<br>
and advise together; and above all, I had nobody to whom I could in<br>
confidence commit the secret of my circumstances to, and could depend<br>
upon for their secrecy and fidelity; and I found by experience, that to<br>
be friendless is the worst condition, next to being in want that a<br>
woman can be reduced to: I say a woman, because &rsquo;tis evident men can be<br>
their own advisers, and their own directors, and know how to work<br>
themselves out of difficulties and into business better than women; but<br>
if a woman has no friend to communicate her affairs to, and to advise<br>
and assist her, &rsquo;tis ten to one but she is undone; nay, and the more<br>
money she has, the more danger she is in of being wronged and deceived;<br>
and this was my case in the affair of the &pound;100 which I left in the<br>
hands of the goldsmith, as above, whose credit, it seems, was upon the<br>
ebb before, but I, that had no knowledge of things and nobody to<br>
consult with, knew nothing of it, and so lost my money.<br>
<br>
In the next place, when a woman is thus left desolate and void of<br>
counsel, she is just like a bag of money or a jewel dropped on the<br>
highway, which is a prey to the next comer; if a man of virtue and<br>
upright principles happens to find it, he will have it cried, and the<br>
owner may come to hear of it again; but how many times shall such a<br>
thing fall into hands that will make no scruple of seizing it for their<br>
own, to once that it shall come into good hands?<br>
<br>
This was evidently my case, for I was now a loose, unguided creature,<br>
and had no help, no assistance, no guide for my conduct; I knew what I<br>
aimed at and what I wanted, but knew nothing how to pursue the end by<br>
direct means. I wanted to be placed in a settled state of living, and<br>
had I happened to meet with a sober, good husband, I should have been<br>
as faithful and true a wife to him as virtue itself could have formed.<br>
If I had been otherwise, the vice came in always at the door of<br>
necessity, not at the door of inclination; and I understood too well,<br>
by the want of it, what the value of a settled life was, to do anything<br>
to forfeit the felicity of it; nay, I should have made the better wife<br>
for all the difficulties I had passed through, by a great deal; nor did<br>
I in any of the time that I had been a wife give my husbands the least<br>
uneasiness on account of my behaviour.<br>
<br>
But all this was nothing; I found no encouraging prospect. I waited; I<br>
lived regularly, and with as much frugality as became my circumstances,<br>
but nothing offered, nothing presented, and the main stock wasted<br>
apace. What to do I knew not; the terror of approaching poverty lay<br>
hard upon my spirits. I had some money, but where to place it I knew<br>
not, nor would the interest of it maintain me, at least not in London.<br>
<br>
At length a new scene opened. There was in the house where I lodged a<br>
north-country woman that went for a gentlewoman, and nothing was more<br>
frequent in her discourse than her account of the cheapness of<br>
provisions, and the easy way of living in her country; how plentiful<br>
and how cheap everything was, what good company they kept, and the<br>
like; till at last I told her she almost tempted me to go and live in<br>
her country; for I that was a widow, though I had sufficient to live<br>
on, yet had no way of increasing it; and that I found I could not live<br>
here under &pound;100 a year, unless I kept no company, no servant, made no<br>
appearance, and buried myself in privacy, as if I was obliged to it by<br>
necessity.<br>
<br>
I should have observed, that she was always made to believe, as<br>
everybody else was, that I was a great fortune, or at least that I had<br>
three or four thousand pounds, if not more, and all in my own hands;<br>
and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclined in the<br>
least to go into her country. She said she had a sister lived near<br>
Liverpool, that her brother was a considerable gentleman there, and had<br>
a great estate also in Ireland; that she would go down there in about<br>
two months, and if I would give her my company thither, I should be as<br>
welcome as herself for a month or more as I pleased, till I should see<br>
how I liked the country; and if I thought fit to live there, she would<br>
undertake they would take care, though they did not entertain lodgers<br>
themselves, they would recommend me to some agreeable family, where I<br>
should be placed to my content.<br>
<br>
If this woman had known my real circumstances, she would never have<br>
laid so many snares, and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor<br>
desolate creature that was good for little when it was caught; and<br>
indeed I, whose case was almost desperate, and thought I could not be<br>
much worse, was not very anxious about what might befall me, provided<br>
they did me no personal injury; so I suffered myself, though not<br>
without a great deal of invitation and great professions of sincere<br>
friendship and real kindness&mdash;I say, I suffered myself to be prevailed<br>
upon to go with her, and accordingly I packed up my baggage, and put<br>
myself in a posture for a journey, though I did not absolutely know<br>
whither I was to go.<br>
<br>
And now I found myself in great distress; what little I had in the<br>
world was all in money, except as before, a little plate, some linen,<br>
and my clothes; as for my household stuff, I had little or none, for I<br>
had lived always in lodgings; but I had not one friend in the world<br>
with whom to trust that little I had, or to direct me how to dispose of<br>
it, and this perplexed me night and day. I thought of the bank, and of<br>
the other companies in London, but I had no friend to commit the<br>
management of it to, and keep and carry about with me bank bills,<br>
tallies, orders, and such things, I looked upon at as unsafe; that if<br>
they were lost, my money was lost, and then I was undone; and, on the<br>
other hand, I might be robbed and perhaps murdered in a strange place<br>
for them. This perplexed me strangely, and what to do I knew not.<br>
<br>
It came in my thoughts one morning that I would go to the bank myself,<br>
where I had often been to receive the interest of some bills I had,<br>
which had interest payable on them, and where I had found a clerk, to<br>
whom I applied myself, very honest and just to me, and particularly so<br>
fair one time that when I had mistold my money, and taken less than my<br>
due, and was coming away, he set me to rights and gave me the rest,<br>
which he might have put into his own pocket.<br>
<br>
I went to him and represented my case very plainly, and asked if he<br>
would trouble himself to be my adviser, who was a poor friendless<br>
widow, and knew not what to do. He told me, if I desired his opinion of<br>
anything within the reach of his business, he would do his endeavour<br>
that I should not be wronged, but that he would also help me to a good<br>
sober person who was a grave man of his acquaintance, who was a clerk<br>
in such business too, though not in their house, whose judgment was<br>
good, and whose honesty I might depend upon. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I will<br>
answer for him, and for every step he takes; if he wrongs you, madam,<br>
of one farthing, it shall lie at my door, I will make it good; and he<br>
delights to assist people in such cases&mdash;he does it as an act of<br>
charity.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was a little at a stand in this discourse; but after some pause I<br>
told him I had rather have depended upon him, because I had found him<br>
honest, but if that could not be, I would take his recommendation<br>
sooner than any one&rsquo;s else. &ldquo;I dare say, madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that you<br>
will be as well satisfied with my friend as with me, and he is<br>
thoroughly able to assist you, which I am not.&rdquo; It seems he had his<br>
hands full of the business of the bank, and had engaged to meddle with<br>
no other business than that of his office, which I heard afterwards,<br>
but did not understand then. He added, that his friend should take<br>
nothing of me for his advice or assistance, and this indeed encouraged<br>
me very much.<br>
<br>
He appointed the same evening, after the bank was shut and business<br>
over, for me to meet him and his friend. And indeed as soon as I saw<br>
his friend, and he began but to talk of the affair, I was fully<br>
satisfied that I had a very honest man to deal with; his countenance<br>
spoke it, and his character, as I heard afterwards, was everywhere so<br>
good, that I had no room for any more doubts upon me.<br>
<br>
After the first meeting, in which I only said what I had said before,<br>
we parted, and he appointed me to come the next day to him, telling me<br>
I might in the meantime satisfy myself of him by inquiry, which,<br>
however, I knew not how well to do, having no acquaintance myself.<br>
<br>
Accordingly I met him the next day, when I entered more freely with him<br>
into my case. I told him my circumstances at large: that I was a widow<br>
come over from America, perfectly desolate and friendless; that I had a<br>
little money, and but a little, and was almost distracted for fear of<br>
losing it, having no friend in the world to trust with the management<br>
of it; that I was going into the north of England to live cheap, that<br>
my stock might not waste; that I would willingly lodge my money in the<br>
bank, but that I durst not carry the bills about me, and the like, as<br>
above; and how to correspond about it, or with whom, I knew not.<br>
<br>
He told me I might lodge the money in the bank as an account, and its<br>
being entered into the books would entitle me to the money at any time,<br>
and if I was in the north I might draw bills on the cashier and receive<br>
it when I would; but that then it would be esteemed as running cash,<br>
and the bank would give no interest for it; that I might buy stock with<br>
it, and so it would lie in store for me, but that then if I wanted to<br>
dispose if it, I must come up to town on purpose to transfer it, and<br>
even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half-yearly<br>
dividend, unless I was here in person, or had some friend I could trust<br>
with having the stock in his name to do it for me, and that would have<br>
the same difficulty in it as before; and with that he looked hard at me<br>
and smiled a little. At last, says he, &ldquo;Why do you not get a head<br>
steward, madam, that may take you and your money together into keeping,<br>
and then you would have the trouble taken off your hands?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, sir,<br>
and the money too, it may be,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;for truly I find the hazard<br>
that way is as much as &rsquo;tis t&rsquo;other way&rdquo;; but I remember I said<br>
secretly to myself, &ldquo;I wish you would ask me the question fairly, I<br>
would consider very seriously on it before I said No.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He went on a good way with me, and I thought once or twice he was in<br>
earnest, but to my real affliction, I found at last he had a wife; but<br>
when he owned he had a wife he shook his head, and said with some<br>
concern, that indeed he had a wife, and no wife. I began to think he<br>
had been in the condition of my late lover, and that his wife had been<br>
distempered or lunatic, or some such thing. However, we had not much<br>
more discourse at that time, but he told me he was in too much hurry of<br>
business then, but that if I would come home to his house after their<br>
business was over, he would by that time consider what might be done<br>
for me, to put my affairs in a posture of security. I told him I would<br>
come, and desired to know where he lived. He gave me a direction in<br>
writing, and when he gave it me he read it to me, and said, &ldquo;There<br>
&rsquo;tis, madam, if you dare trust yourself with me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said I,<br>
&ldquo;I believe I may venture to trust you with myself, for you have a wife,<br>
you say, and I don&rsquo;t want a husband; besides, I dare trust you with my<br>
money, which is all I have in the world, and if that were gone, I may<br>
trust myself anywhere.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He said some things in jest that were very handsome and mannerly, and<br>
would have pleased me very well if they had been in earnest; but that<br>
passed over, I took the directions, and appointed to attend him at his<br>
house at seven o&rsquo;clock the same evening.<br>
<br>
When I came he made several proposals for my placing my money in the<br>
bank, in order to my having interest for it; but still some difficulty<br>
or other came in the way, which he objected as not safe; and I found<br>
such a sincere disinterested honesty in him, that I began to muse with<br>
myself, that I had certainly found the honest man I wanted, and that I<br>
could never put myself into better hands; so I told him with a great<br>
deal of frankness that I had never met with a man or woman yet that I<br>
could trust, or in whom I could think myself safe, but that I saw he<br>
was so disinterestedly concerned for my safety, that I said I would<br>
freely trust him with the management of that little I had, if he would<br>
accept to be steward for a poor widow that could give him no salary.<br>
<br>
He smiled and, standing up, with great respect saluted me. He told me<br>
he could not but take it very kindly that I had so good an opinion of<br>
him; that he would not deceive me, that he would do anything in his<br>
power to serve me, and expect no salary; but that he could not by any<br>
means accept of a trust, that it might bring him to be suspected of<br>
self-interest, and that if I should die he might have disputes with my<br>
executors, which he should be very loth to encumber himself with.<br>
<br>
I told him if those were all his objections I would soon remove them,<br>
and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty;<br>
for that, first, as for suspecting him, if ever I should do it, now<br>
is the time to suspect him, and not put the trust into his hands, and<br>
whenever I did suspect him, he could but throw it up then and refuse<br>
to go any further. Then, as to executors, I assured him I had no<br>
heirs, nor any relations in England, and I would have neither heirs<br>
nor executors but himself, unless I should alter my condition before<br>
I died, and then his trust and trouble should cease together, which,<br>
however, I had no prospect of yet; but I told him if I died as I was,<br>
it should be all his own, and he would deserve it by being so faithful<br>
to me as I was satisfied he would be.<br>
<br>
He changed his countenance at this discourse, and asked me how I came<br>
to have so much good-will for him; and, looking very much pleased, said<br>
he might very lawfully wish he was a single man for my sake. I smiled,<br>
and told him as he was not, my offer could have no design upon him in<br>
it, and to wish, as he did, was not to be allowed, &rsquo;twas criminal to<br>
his wife.<br>
<br>
He told me I was wrong. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;madam, as I said before, I<br>
have a wife and no wife, and &rsquo;twould be no sin to me to wish her<br>
hanged, if that were all.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know nothing of your circumstances that<br>
way, sir,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but it cannot be innocent to wish your wife dead.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; says he again, &ldquo;she is a wife and no wife; you don&rsquo;t know<br>
what I am, or what she is.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;sir, I do not know what you are, but I believe<br>
you to be an honest man, and that&rsquo;s the cause of all my confidence in<br>
you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and so I am, I hope, too. But I am something<br>
else too, madam; for,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to be plain with you, I am a cuckold,<br>
and she is a whore.&rdquo; He spoke it in a kind of jest, but it was with<br>
such an awkward smile, that I perceived it was what struck very close<br>
to him, and he looked dismally when he said it.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That alters the case indeed, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as to that part you were<br>
speaking of; but a cuckold, you know, may be an honest man; it does not<br>
alter that case at all. Besides, I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;since your wife is<br>
so dishonest to you, you are too honest to her to own her for your<br>
wife; but that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is what I have nothing to do with.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I do not think to clear my hands of her; for, to be<br>
plain with you, madam,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I am no contented cuckold neither:<br>
on the other hand, I assure you it provokes me the highest degree, but<br>
I can&rsquo;t help myself; she that will be a whore, will be a whore.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I waived the discourse and began to talk of my business; but I found he<br>
could not have done with it, so I let him alone, and he went on to tell<br>
me all the circumstances of his case, too long to relate here;<br>
particularly, that having been out of England some time before he came<br>
to the post he was in, she had had two children in the meantime by an<br>
officer of the army; and that when he came to England and, upon her<br>
submission, took her again, and maintained her very well, yet she ran<br>
away from him with a linen-draper&rsquo;s apprentice, robbed him of what she<br>
could come at, and continued to live from him still. &ldquo;So that, madam,&rdquo;<br>
says he, &ldquo;she is a whore not by necessity, which is the common bait of<br>
your sex, but by inclination, and for the sake of the vice.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Well, I pitied him, and wished him well rid of her, and still would<br>
have talked of my business, but it would not do. At last he looks<br>
steadily at me. &ldquo;Look you, madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you came to ask advice of<br>
me, and I will serve you as faithfully as if you were my own sister;<br>
but I must turn the tables, since you oblige me to do it, and are so<br>
friendly to me, and I think I must ask advice of you. Tell me, what<br>
must a poor abused fellow do with a whore? What can I do to do myself<br>
justice upon her?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis a case too nice for me to advise in, but it<br>
seems she has run away from you, so you are rid of her fairly; what can<br>
you desire more?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, she is gone indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I am not<br>
clear of her for all that.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;she may indeed run you into debt, but the law<br>
has furnished you with methods to prevent that also; you may cry her<br>
down, as they call it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that is not the case neither; I have taken care of<br>
all that; &rsquo;tis not that part that I speak of, but I would be rid of her<br>
so that I might marry again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;then you must divorce her. If you can prove what<br>
you say, you may certainly get that done, and then, I suppose, you are<br>
free.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very tedious and expensive,&rdquo; says he.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if you can get any woman you like to take your word, I<br>
suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with you that she takes<br>
herself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but &rsquo;twould be hard to bring an honest woman to do<br>
that; and for the other sort,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I have had enough of her to<br>
meddle with any more whores.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It occurred to me presently, &ldquo;I would have taken your word with all my<br>
heart, if you had but asked me the question&rdquo;; but that was to myself.<br>
To him I replied, &ldquo;Why, you shut the door against any honest woman<br>
accepting you, for you condemn all that should venture upon you at<br>
once, and conclude, that really a woman that takes you now can&rsquo;t be<br>
honest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I wish you would satisfy me that an honest woman would<br>
take me; I&rsquo;d venture it&rdquo;; and then turns short upon me, &ldquo;Will you take<br>
me, madam?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a fair question,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;after what you have said;<br>
however, lest you should think I wait only for a recantation of it, I<br>
shall answer you plainly, No, not I; my business is of another kind<br>
with you, and I did not expect you would have turned my serious<br>
application to you, in my own distracted case, into a comedy.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my case is as distracted as yours can be, and I<br>
stand in as much need of advice as you do, for I think if I have not<br>
relief somewhere, I shall be made myself, and I know not what course to<br>
take, I protest to you.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis easy to give advice in your case, much easier<br>
than it is in mine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Speak then,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I beg of you, for now you<br>
encourage me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if your case is so plain as you say it is, you may be<br>
legally divorced, and then you may find honest women enough to ask the<br>
question of fairly; the sex is not so scarce that you can want a wife.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am in earnest; I&rsquo;ll take your advice; but<br>
shall I ask you one question seriously beforehand?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Any question,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but that you did before.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, that answer will not do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for, in short, that is the<br>
question I shall ask.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You may ask what questions you please, but you have my answer to that<br>
already,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Besides, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;can you think so ill of me<br>
as that I would give any answer to such a question beforehand? Can any<br>
woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to<br>
banter her?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I do not banter you, I am in earnest; consider<br>
of it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; says I, a little gravely, &ldquo;I came to you about my own<br>
business; I beg of you to let me know, what you will advise me to do?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I will be prepared,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;against you come again.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you have forbid my coming any more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said he, and looked a little surprised.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t expect I should visit you on the account<br>
you talk of.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you shall promise me to come again, however, and I<br>
will not say any more of it till I have gotten the divorce, but I<br>
desire you will prepare to be better conditioned when that&rsquo;s done, for<br>
you shall be the woman, or I will not be divorced at all; why, I owe it<br>
to your unlooked-for kindness, if it were to nothing else, but I have<br>
other reasons too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He could not have said anything in the world that pleased me better;<br>
however, I knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the<br>
thing was so remote, as it appeared to be, and that it was time enough<br>
to accept of it when he was able to perform it; so I said very<br>
respectfully to him, it was time enough to consider of these things<br>
when he was in a condition to talk of them; in the meantime, I told<br>
him, I was going a great way from him, and he would find objects enough<br>
to please him better. We broke off here for the present, and he made me<br>
promise him to come again the next day, for his resolutions upon my own<br>
business, which after some pressing I did; though had he seen farther<br>
into me, I wanted no pressing on that account.<br>
<br>
I came the next evening, accordingly, and brought my maid with me, to<br>
let him see that I kept a maid, but I sent her away as soon as I was<br>
gone in. He would have had me let the maid have stayed, but I would<br>
not, but ordered her aloud to come for me again about nine o&rsquo;clock. But<br>
he forbade that, and told me he would see me safe home, which, by the<br>
way, I was not very well pleased with, supposing he might do that to<br>
know where I lived and inquire into my character and circumstances.<br>
However, I ventured that, for all that the people there or thereabout<br>
knew of me, was to my advantage; and all the character he had of me,<br>
after he had inquired, was that I was a woman of fortune, and that I<br>
was a very modest, sober body; which, whether true or not in the main,<br>
yet you may see how necessary it is for all women who expect anything<br>
in the world, to preserve the character of their virtue, even when<br>
perhaps they may have sacrificed the thing itself.<br>
<br>
I found, and was not a little pleased with it, that he had provided a<br>
supper for me. I found also he lived very handsomely, and had a house<br>
very handsomely furnished; all of which I was rejoiced at indeed, for I<br>
looked upon it as all my own.<br>
<br>
We had now a second conference upon the subject-matter of the last<br>
conference. He laid his business very home indeed; he protested his<br>
affection to me, and indeed I had no room to doubt it; he declared that<br>
it began from the first moment I talked with him, and long before I had<br>
mentioned leaving my effects with him. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no matter when it began,&rdquo;<br>
thought I; &ldquo;if it will but hold, &rsquo;twill be well enough.&rdquo; He then told<br>
me how much the offer I had made of trusting him with my effects, and<br>
leaving them to him, had engaged him. &ldquo;So I intended it should,&rdquo;<br>
thought I, &ldquo;but then I thought you had been a single man too.&rdquo; After we<br>
had supped, I observed he pressed me very hard to drink two or three<br>
glasses of wine, which, however, I declined, but drank one glass or<br>
two. He then told me he had a proposal to make to me, which I should<br>
promise him I would not take ill if I should not grant it. I told him I<br>
hoped he would make no dishonourable proposal to me, especially in his<br>
own house, and that if it was such, I desired he would not propose it,<br>
that I might not be obliged to offer any resentment to him that did not<br>
become the respect I professed for him, and the trust I had placed in<br>
him in coming to his house; and begged of him he would give me leave to<br>
go away, and accordingly began to put on my gloves and prepare to be<br>
gone, though at the same time I no more intended it than he intended to<br>
let me.<br>
<br>
Well, he importuned me not to talk of going; he assured me he had no<br>
dishonourable thing in his thoughts about me, and was very far from<br>
offering anything to me that was dishonourable, and if I thought so, he<br>
would choose to say no more of it.<br>
<br>
That part I did not relish at all. I told him I was ready to hear<br>
anything that he had to say, depending that he would say nothing<br>
unworthy of himself, or unfit for me to hear. Upon this, he told me his<br>
proposal was this: that I would marry him, though he had not yet<br>
obtained the divorce from the whore his wife; and to satisfy me that he<br>
meant honourably, he would promise not to desire me to live with him,<br>
or go to bed with him till the divorce was obtained. My heart said yes<br>
to this offer at first word, but it was necessary to play the hypocrite<br>
a little more with him; so I seemed to decline the motion with some<br>
warmth, and besides a little condemning the thing as unfair, told him<br>
that such a proposal could be of no signification, but to entangle us<br>
both in great difficulties; for if he should not at last obtain the<br>
divorce, yet we could not dissolve the marriage, neither could we<br>
proceed in it; so that if he was disappointed in the divorce, I left<br>
him to consider what a condition we should both be in.<br>
<br>
In short, I carried on the argument against this so far, that I<br>
convinced him it was not a proposal that had any sense in it. Well,<br>
then he went from it to another, and that was, that I would sign and<br>
seal a contract with him, conditioning to marry him as soon as the<br>
divorce was obtained, and to be void if he could not obtain it.<br>
<br>
I told him such a thing was more rational than the other; but as this<br>
was the first time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in<br>
earnest in this affair, I did not use to say Yes at first asking; I<br>
would consider of it.<br>
<br>
I played with this lover as an angler does with a trout. I found I had<br>
him fast on the hook, so I jested with his new proposal, and put him<br>
off. I told him he knew little of me, and bade him inquire about me; I<br>
let him also go home with me to my lodging, though I would not ask him<br>
to go in, for I told him it was not decent.<br>
<br>
In short, I ventured to avoid signing a contract of marriage, and the<br>
reason why I did it was because the lady that had invited me so<br>
earnestly to go with her into Lancashire insisted so positively upon<br>
it, and promised me such great fortunes, and such fine things there,<br>
that I was tempted to go and try. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I may mend myself<br>
very much&rdquo;; and then I made no scruple in my thoughts of quitting my<br>
honest citizen, whom I was not so much in love with as not to leave him<br>
for a richer.<br>
<br>
In a word, I avoided a contract; but told him I would go into the<br>
north, that he should know where to write to me by the consequence of<br>
the business I had entrusted with him; that I would give him a<br>
sufficient pledge of my respect for him, for I would leave almost all I<br>
had in the world in his hands; and I would thus far give him my word,<br>
that as soon as he had sued out a divorce from his first wife, he would<br>
send me an account of it, I would come up to London, and that then we<br>
would talk seriously of the matter.<br>
<br>
It was a base design I went with, that I must confess, though I was<br>
invited thither with a design much worse than mine was, as the sequel<br>
will discover. Well, I went with my friend, as I called her, into<br>
Lancashire. All the way we went she caressed me with the utmost<br>
appearance of a sincere, undissembled affection; treated me, except my<br>
coach-hire, all the way; and her brother brought a gentleman&rsquo;s coach to<br>
Warrington to receive us, and we were carried from thence to Liverpool<br>
with as much ceremony as I could desire. We were also entertained at a<br>
merchant&rsquo;s house in Liverpool three or four days very handsomely; I<br>
forbear to tell his name, because of what followed. Then she told me<br>
she would carry me to an uncle&rsquo;s house of hers, where we should be<br>
nobly entertained. She did so; her uncle, as she called him, sent a<br>
coach and four horses for us, and we were carried near forty miles I<br>
know not whither.<br>
<br>
We came, however, to a gentleman&rsquo;s seat, where was a numerous family, a<br>
large park, extraordinary company indeed, and where she was called<br>
cousin. I told her if she had resolved to bring me into such company as<br>
this, she should have let me have prepared myself, and have furnished<br>
myself with better clothes. The ladies took notice of that, and told me<br>
very genteelly they did not value people in their country so much by<br>
their clothes as they did in London; that their cousin had fully<br>
informed them of my quality, and that I did not want clothes to set me<br>
off; in short, they entertained me, not like what I was, but like what<br>
they thought I had been, namely, a widow lady of a great fortune.<br>
<br>
The first discovery I made here was, that the family were all Roman<br>
Catholics, and the cousin too, whom I called my friend; however, I must<br>
say that nobody in the world could behave better to me, and I had all<br>
the civility shown me that I could have had if I had been of their<br>
opinion. The truth is, I had not so much principle of any kind as to be<br>
nice in point of religion, and I presently learned to speak favourably<br>
of the Romish Church; particularly, I told them I saw little but the<br>
prejudice of education in all the difference that were among Christians<br>
about religion, and if it had so happened that my father had been a<br>
Roman Catholic, I doubted not but I should have been as well pleased<br>
with their religion as my own.<br>
<br>
This obliged them in the highest degree, and as I was besieged day and<br>
night with good company and pleasant discourse, so I had two or three<br>
old ladies that lay at me upon the subject of religion too. I was so<br>
complaisant, that though I would not completely engage, yet I made no<br>
scruple to be present at their mass, and to conform to all their<br>
gestures as they showed me the pattern, but I would not come too cheap;<br>
so that I only in the main encouraged them to expect that I would turn<br>
Roman Catholic, if I was instructed in the Catholic doctrine as they<br>
called it, and so the matter rested.<br>
<br>
I stayed here about six weeks; and then my conductor led me back to a<br>
country village, about six miles from Liverpool, where her brother (as<br>
she called him) came to visit me in his own chariot, and in a very good<br>
figure, with two footmen in a good livery; and the next thing was to<br>
make love to me. As it had happened to me, one would think I could not<br>
have been cheated, and indeed I thought so myself, having a safe card<br>
at home, which I resolved not to quit unless I could mend myself very<br>
much. However, in all appearance this brother was a match worth my<br>
listening to, and the least his estate was valued at was &pound;1000 a year,<br>
but the sister said it was worth &pound;1500 a year, and lay most of it in<br>
Ireland.<br>
<br>
I that was a great fortune, and passed for such, was above being asked<br>
how much my estate was; and my false friend taking it upon a foolish<br>
hearsay, had raised it from &pound;500 to &pound;5000, and by the time she came<br>
into the country she called it &pound;15,000. The Irishman, for such I<br>
understood him to be, was stark mad at this bait; in short, he courted<br>
me, made me presents, and ran in debt like a madman for the expenses of<br>
his equipage and of his courtship. He had, to give him his due, the<br>
appearance of an extraordinary fine gentleman; he was tall,<br>
well-shaped, and had an extraordinary address; talked as naturally of<br>
his park and his stables, of his horses, his gamekeepers, his woods,<br>
his tenants, and his servants, as if we had been in the mansion-house,<br>
and I had seen them all about me.<br>
<br>
He never so much as asked me about my fortune or estate, but assured me<br>
that when we came to Dublin he would jointure me in &pound;600 a year good<br>
land; and that we could enter into a deed of settlement or contract<br>
here for the performance of it.<br>
<br>
This was such language indeed as I had not been used to, and I was here<br>
beaten out of all my measures; I had a she-devil in my bosom, every<br>
hour telling me how great her brother lived. One time she would come<br>
for my orders, how I would have my coaches painted, and how lined; and<br>
another time what clothes my page should wear; in short, my eyes were<br>
dazzled. I had now lost my power of saying No, and, to cut the story<br>
short, I consented to be married; but to be the more private, we were<br>
carried farther into the country, and married by a Romish clergyman,<br>
who I was assured would marry us as effectually as a Church of England<br>
parson.<br>
<br>
I cannot say but I had some reflections in this affair upon the<br>
dishonourable forsaking my faithful citizen, who loved me sincerely,<br>
and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous whore by whom<br>
he had been indeed barbarously used, and promised himself infinite<br>
happiness in his new choice; which choice was now giving up herself to<br>
another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be.<br>
<br>
But the glittering shoe of a great estate, and of fine things, which<br>
the deceived creature that was now my deceiver represented every hour<br>
to my imagination, hurried me away, and gave me no time to think of<br>
London, or of anything there, much less of the obligation I had to a<br>
person of infinitely more real merit than what was now before me.<br>
<br>
But the thing was done; I was now in the arms of my new spouse, who<br>
appeared still the same as before; great even to magnificence, and<br>
nothing less than &pound;1000 a year could support the ordinary equipage he<br>
appeared in.<br>
<br>
After we had been married about a month, he began to talk of my going<br>
to West Chester in order to embark for Ireland. However, he did not<br>
hurry me, for we stayed near three weeks longer, and then he sent to<br>
Chester for a coach to meet us at the Black Rock, as they call it, over<br>
against Liverpool. Thither we went in a fine boat they call a pinnace,<br>
with six oars; his servants, and horses, and baggage going in the<br>
ferry-boat. He made his excuse to me that he had no acquaintance in<br>
Chester, but he would go before and get some handsome apartment for me<br>
at a private house. I asked him how long we should stay at Chester. He<br>
said, not at all, any longer than one night or two, but he would<br>
immediately hire a coach to go to Holyhead. Then I told him he should<br>
by no means give himself the trouble to get private lodgings for one<br>
night or two, for that Chester being a great place, I made no doubt but<br>
there would be very good inns and accommodation enough; so we lodged at<br>
an inn in the West Street, not far from the Cathedral; I forget what<br>
sign it was at.<br>
<br>
Here my spouse, talking of my going to Ireland, asked me if I had no<br>
affairs to settle at London before we went off. I told him No, not of<br>
any great consequence, but what might be done as well by letter from<br>
Dublin. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; says he, very respectfully, &ldquo;I suppose the greatest<br>
part of your estate, which my sister tells me is most of it in money in<br>
the Bank of England, lies secure enough, but in case it required<br>
transferring, or any way altering its property, it might be necessary<br>
to go up to London and settle those things before we went over.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I seemed to look strange at it, and told him I knew not what he meant;<br>
that I had no effects in the Bank of England that I knew of; and I<br>
hoped he could not say that I had ever told him I had. No, he said, I<br>
had not told him so, but his sister had said the greatest part of my<br>
estate lay there. &ldquo;And I only mentioned it, me dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that if<br>
there was any occasion to settle it, or order anything about it, we<br>
might not be obliged to the hazard and trouble of another voyage back<br>
again&rdquo;; for he added, that he did not care to venture me too much upon<br>
the sea.<br>
<br>
I was surprised at this talk, and began to consider very seriously what<br>
the meaning of it must be; and it presently occurred to me that my<br>
friend, who called him brother, had represented me in colours which<br>
were not my due; and I thought, since it was come to that pitch, that I<br>
would know the bottom of it before I went out of England, and before I<br>
should put myself into I knew not whose hands in a strange country.<br>
<br>
Upon this I called his sister into my chamber the next morning, and<br>
letting her know the discourse her brother and I had been upon the<br>
evening before, I conjured her to tell me what she had said to him, and<br>
upon what foot it was that she had made this marriage. She owned that<br>
she had told him that I was a great fortune, and said that she was told<br>
so at London. &ldquo;Told so!&rdquo; says I warmly; &ldquo;did I ever tell you so?&rdquo; No,<br>
she said, it was true I did not tell her so, but I had said several<br>
times that what I had was in my own disposal. &ldquo;I did so,&rdquo; returned I<br>
very quickly and hastily, &ldquo;but I never told you I had anything called a<br>
fortune; no, not that I had &pound;100, or the value of &pound;100, in the world.<br>
Any how did it consist with my being a fortune,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I should<br>
come here into the north of England with you, only upon the account of<br>
living cheap?&rdquo; At these words, which I spoke warm and high, my husband,<br>
her brother (as she called him), came into the room, and I desired him<br>
to come and sit down, for I had something of moment to say before them<br>
both, which it was absolutely necessary he should hear.<br>
<br>
He looked a little disturbed at the assurance with which I seemed to<br>
speak it, and came and sat down by me, having first shut the door; upon<br>
which I began, for I was very much provoked, and turning myself to him,<br>
&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; (for I spoke with kindness on his<br>
side), &ldquo;that you have a very great abuse put upon you, and an injury<br>
done you never to be repaired in your marrying me, which, however, as I<br>
have had no hand in it, I desire I may be fairly acquitted of it, and<br>
that the blame may lie where it ought to lie, and nowhere else, for I<br>
wash my hands of every part of it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;What injury can be done me, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in marrying you. I<br>
hope it is to my honour and advantage every way.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will soon explain<br>
it to you,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;and I fear you will have no reason to think<br>
yourself well used; but I will convince you, my dear,&rdquo; says I again,<br>
&ldquo;that I have had no hand in it&rdquo;; and there I stopped a while.<br>
<br>
He looked now scared and wild, and began, I believe, to suspect what<br>
followed; however, looking towards me, and saying only, &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he sat<br>
silent, as if to hear what I had more to say; so I went on. &ldquo;I asked<br>
you last night,&rdquo; said I, speaking to him, &ldquo;if ever I made any boast to<br>
you of my estate, or ever told you I had any estate in the Bank of<br>
England or anywhere else, and you owned I had not, as is most true; and<br>
I desire you will tell me here, before your sister, if ever I gave you<br>
any reason from me to think so, or that ever we had any discourse about<br>
it&rdquo;; and he owned again I had not, but said I had appeared always as a<br>
woman of fortune, and he depended on it that I was so, and hoped he was<br>
not deceived. &ldquo;I am not inquiring yet whether you have been deceived or<br>
not,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I fear you have, and I too; but I am clearing myself<br>
from the unjust charge of being concerned in deceiving you.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I have been now asking your sister if ever I told her of any fortune<br>
or estate I had, or gave her any particulars of it; and she owns I<br>
never did. Any pray, madam,&rdquo; said I, turning myself to her, &ldquo;be so just<br>
to me, before your brother, to charge me, if you can, if ever I<br>
pretended to you that I had an estate; and why, if I had, should I come<br>
down into this country with you on purpose to spare that little I had,<br>
and live cheap?&rdquo; She could not deny one word, but said she had been<br>
told in London that I had a very great fortune, and that it lay in the<br>
Bank of England.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;And now, dear sir,&rdquo; said I, turning myself to my new spouse again, &ldquo;be<br>
so just to me as to tell me who has abused both you and me so much as<br>
to make you believe I was a fortune, and prompt you to court me to this<br>
marriage?&rdquo; He could not speak a word, but pointed to her; and, after<br>
some more pause, flew out in the most furious passion that ever I saw a<br>
man in my life, cursing her, and calling her all the whores and hard<br>
names he could think of; and that she had ruined him, declaring that<br>
she had told him I had &pound;15,000, and that she was to have &pound;500 of him<br>
for procuring this match for him. He then added, directing his speech<br>
to me, that she was none of his sister, but had been his whore for two<br>
years before, that she had had &pound;100 of him in part of this bargain, and<br>
that he was utterly undone if things were as I said; and in his raving<br>
he swore he would let her heart&rsquo;s blood out immediately, which<br>
frightened her and me too. She cried, said she had been told so in the<br>
house where I lodged. But this aggravated him more than before, that<br>
she should put so far upon him, and run things such a length upon no<br>
other authority than a hearsay; and then, turning to me again, said<br>
very honestly, he was afraid we were both undone. &ldquo;For, to be plain, my<br>
dear, I have no estate,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;what little I had, this devil has<br>
made me run out in waiting on you and putting me into this equipage.&rdquo;<br>
She took the opportunity of his being earnest in talking with me, and<br>
got out of the room, and I never saw her more.<br>
<br>
I was confounded now as much as he, and knew not what to say. I thought<br>
many ways that I had the worst of it, but his saying he was undone, and<br>
that he had no estate neither, put me into a mere distraction. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;<br>
says I to him, &ldquo;this has been a hellish juggle, for we are married here<br>
upon the foot of a double fraud; you are undone by the disappointment,<br>
it seems; and if I had had a fortune I had been cheated too, for you<br>
say you have nothing.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;You would indeed have been cheated, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but you would<br>
not have been undone, for &pound;15,000 would have maintained us both very<br>
handsomely in this country; and I assure you,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I had<br>
resolved to have dedicated every groat of it to you; I would not have<br>
wronged you of a shilling, and the rest I would have made up in my<br>
affection to you, and tenderness of you, as long as I lived.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was very honest indeed, and I really believe he spoke as he<br>
intended, and that he was a man that was as well qualified to make me<br>
happy, as to his temper and behaviour, as any man ever was; but his<br>
having no estate, and being run into debt on this ridiculous account in<br>
the country, made all the prospect dismal and dreadful, and I knew not<br>
what to say, or what to think of myself.<br>
<br>
I told him it was very unhappy that so much love, and so much good<br>
nature as I discovered in him, should be thus precipitated into misery;<br>
that I saw nothing before us but ruin; for as to me, it was my<br>
unhappiness that what little I had was not able to relieve us week, and<br>
with that I pulled out a bank bill of &pound;20 and eleven guineas, which I<br>
told him I had saved out of my little income, and that by the account<br>
that creature had given me of the way of living in that country, I<br>
expected it would maintain me three or four years; that if it was taken<br>
from me, I was left destitute, and he knew what the condition of a<br>
woman among strangers must be, if she had no money in her pocket;<br>
however, I told him, if he would take it, there it was.<br>
<br>
He told me with a great concern, and I thought I saw tears stand in his<br>
eyes, that he would not touch it; that he abhorred the thoughts of<br>
stripping me and make me miserable; that, on the contrary, he had fifty<br>
guineas left, which was all he had in the world, and he pulled it out<br>
and threw it down on the table, bidding me take it, though he were to<br>
starve for want of it.<br>
<br>
I returned, with the same concern for him, that I could not bear to<br>
hear him talk so; that, on the contrary, if he could propose any<br>
probable method of living, I would do anything that became me on my<br>
part, and that I would live as close and as narrow as he could desire.<br>
<br>
He begged of me to talk no more at that rate, for it would make him<br>
distracted; he said he was bred a gentleman, though he was reduced to a<br>
low fortune, and that there was but one way left which he could think<br>
of, and that would not do, unless I could answer him one question,<br>
which, however, he said he would not press me to. I told him I would<br>
answer it honestly; whether it would be to his satisfaction or not,<br>
that I could not tell.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, then, my dear, tell me plainly,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;will the little you<br>
have keep us together in any figure, or in any station or place, or<br>
will it not?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It was my happiness hitherto that I had not discovered myself or my<br>
circumstances at all&mdash;no, not so much as my name; and seeing these was<br>
nothing to be expected from him, however good-humoured and however<br>
honest he seemed to be, but to live on what I knew would soon be<br>
wasted, I resolved to conceal everything but the bank bill and the<br>
eleven guineas which I had owned; and I would have been very glad to<br>
have lost that and have been set down where he took me up. I had indeed<br>
another bank bill about me of &pound;30, which was the whole of what I<br>
brought with me, as well to subsist on in the country, as not knowing<br>
what might offer; because this creature, the go-between that had thus<br>
betrayed us both, had made me believe strange things of my marrying to<br>
my advantage in the country, and I was not willing to be without money,<br>
whatever might happen. This bill I concealed, and that made me the<br>
freer of the rest, in consideration of his circumstances, for I really<br>
pitied him heartily.<br>
<br>
But to return to his question, I told him I never willingly deceived<br>
him, and I never would. I was very sorry to tell him that the little I<br>
had would not subsist us; that it was not sufficient to subsist me<br>
alone in the south country, and that this was the reason that made me<br>
put myself into the hands of that woman who called him brother, she<br>
having assured me that I might board very handsomely at a town called<br>
Manchester, where I had not yet been, for about &pound;6 a year; and my whole<br>
income not being about &pound;15 a year, I thought I might live easy upon it,<br>
and wait for better things.<br>
<br>
He shook his head and remained silent, and a very melancholy evening we<br>
had; however, we supped together, and lay together that night, and when<br>
we had almost supped he looked a little better and more cheerful, and<br>
called for a bottle of wine. &ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;though the case<br>
is bad, it is to no purpose to be dejected. Come, be as easy as you<br>
can; I will endeavour to find out some way or other to live; if you can<br>
but subsist yourself, that is better than nothing. I must try the world<br>
again; a man ought to think like a man; to be discouraged is to yield<br>
to the misfortune.&rdquo; With this he filled a glass and drank to me,<br>
holding my hand and pressing it hard in his hand all the while the wine<br>
went down, and protesting afterwards his main concern was for me.<br>
<br>
It was really a true, gallant spirit he was of, and it was the more<br>
grievous to me. &rsquo;Tis something of relief even to be undone by a man of<br>
honour, rather than by a scoundrel; but here the greatest<br>
disappointment was on his side, for he had really spent a great deal of<br>
money, deluded by this madam the procuress; and it was very remarkable<br>
on what poor terms he proceeded. First the baseness of the creature<br>
herself is to be observed, who, for the getting &pound;100 herself, could be<br>
content to let him spend three or four more, though perhaps it was all<br>
he had in the world, and more than all; when she had not the least<br>
ground, more than a little tea-table chat, to say that I had any<br>
estate, or was a fortune, or the like. It is true the design of<br>
deluding a woman of fortune, if I had been so, was base enough; the<br>
putting the face of great things upon poor circumstances was a fraud,<br>
and bad enough; but the case a little differed too, and that in his<br>
favour, for he was not a rake that made a trade to delude women, and,<br>
as some have done, get six or seven fortunes after one another, and<br>
then rifle and run away from them; but he was really a gentleman,<br>
unfortunate and low, but had lived well; and though, if I had had a<br>
fortune, I should have been enraged at the slut for betraying me, yet<br>
really for the man, a fortune would not have been ill bestowed on him,<br>
for he was a lovely person indeed, of generous principles, good sense,<br>
and of abundance of good-humour.<br>
<br>
We had a great deal of close conversation that night, for we neither of<br>
us slept much; he was as penitent for having put all those cheats upon<br>
me as if it had been felony, and that he was going to execution; he<br>
offered me again every shilling of the money he had about him, and said<br>
he would go into the army and seek the world for more.<br>
<br>
I asked him why he would be so unkind to carry me into Ireland, when I<br>
might suppose he could not have subsisted me there. He took me in his<br>
arms. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;depend upon it, I never designed to go to<br>
Ireland at all, much less to have carried you thither, but came hither<br>
to be out of the observation of the people, who had heard what I<br>
pretended to, and withal, that nobody might ask me for money before I<br>
was furnished to supply them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;But where, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;were we to have gone next?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confess the whole scheme to you as I had<br>
laid it; I purposed here to ask you something about your estate, as you<br>
see I did, and when you, as I expected you would, had entered into some<br>
account with me of the particulars, I would have made an excuse to you<br>
to have put off our voyage to Ireland for some time, and to have gone<br>
first towards London.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I resolved to have confessed all the<br>
circumstances of my own affairs to you, and let you know I had indeed<br>
made use of these artifices to obtain your consent to marry me, but had<br>
now nothing to do but ask to your pardon, and to tell you how<br>
abundantly, as I have said above, I would endeavour to make you forget<br>
what was past, by the felicity of the days to come.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;I find you would soon have conquered me; and<br>
it is my affliction now, that I am not in a condition to let you see<br>
how easily I should have been reconciled to you, and have passed by all<br>
the tricks you had put upon me, in recompense of so much good-humour.<br>
But, my dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what can we do now? We are both undone, and<br>
what better are we for our being reconciled together, seeing we have<br>
nothing to live on?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
We proposed a great many things, but nothing could offer where there<br>
was nothing to begin with. He begged me at last to talk no more of it,<br>
for, he said, I would break his heart; so we talked of other things a<br>
little, till at last he took a husband&rsquo;s leave of me, and so we went to<br>
sleep.<br>
<br>
He rose before me in the morning; and indeed, having lain awake almost<br>
all night, I was very sleepy, and lay till near eleven o&rsquo;clock. In this<br>
time he took his horses and three servants, and all his linen and<br>
baggage, and away he went, leaving a short but moving letter for me on<br>
the table, as follows:&mdash;<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;MY DEAR&mdash;I am a dog; I have abused you; but I have been drawn into<br>
 do it by a base creature, contrary to my principle and the general<br>
 practice of my life. Forgive me, my dear! I ask your pardon with<br>
 the greatest sincerity; I am the most miserable of men, in having<br>
 deluded you. I have been so happy to possess you, and now am so<br>
 wretched as to be forced to fly from you. Forgive me, my dear;<br>
 once more I say, forgive me! I am not able to see you ruined by<br>
 me, and myself unable to support you. Our marriage is nothing; I<br>
 shall never be able to see you again; I here discharge you from<br>
 it; if you can marry to your advantage, do not decline it on my<br>
 account; I here swear to you on my faith, and on the word of a man<br>
 of honour, I will never disturb your repose if I should know of it,<br>
 which, however, is not likely. On the other hand, if you should not<br>
 marry, and if good fortune should befall me, it shall be all yours,<br>
 wherever you are.<br>
<br>
 I have put some of the stock of money I have left into your pocket;<br>
 take places for yourself and your maid in the stage-coach, and<br>
 go for London; I hope it will bear your charges thither, without<br>
 breaking into your own. Again I sincerely ask your pardon, and will<br>
 do so as often as I shall ever think of you.<br>
<br>
 Adieu, my dear, for ever,<br>
 I am, your most affectionately,<br>
 J.E.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Nothing that ever befell me in my life sank so deep into my heart as<br>
this farewell. I reproached him a thousand times in my thoughts for<br>
leaving me, for I would have gone with him through the world, if I had<br>
begged my bread. I felt in my pocket, and there found ten guineas, his<br>
gold watch, and two little rings, one a small diamond ring worth only<br>
about &pound;6, and the other a plain gold ring.<br>
<br>
I sat me down and looked upon these things two hours together, and<br>
scarce spoke a word, till my maid interrupted me by telling me my<br>
dinner was ready. I ate but little, and after dinner I fell into a<br>
vehement fit of crying, every now and then calling him by his name,<br>
which was James. &ldquo;O Jemmy!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;come back, come back. I&rsquo;ll give<br>
you all I have; I&rsquo;ll beg, I&rsquo;ll starve with you.&rdquo; And thus I ran raving<br>
about the room several times, and then sat down between whiles, and<br>
then walking about again, called upon him to come back, and then cried<br>
again; and thus I passed the afternoon, till about seven o&rsquo;clock, when<br>
it was near dusk, in the evening, being August, when, to my unspeakable<br>
surprise, he comes back into the inn, but without a servant, and comes<br>
directly up into my chamber.<br>
<br>
I was in the greatest confusion imaginable, and so was he too. I could<br>
not imagine what should be the occasion of it, and began to be at odds<br>
with myself whether to be glad or sorry; but my affection biassed all<br>
the rest, and it was impossible to conceal my joy, which was too great<br>
for smiles, for it burst out into tears. He was no sooner entered the<br>
room but he ran to me and took me in his arms, holding me fast, and<br>
almost stopping my breath with his kisses, but spoke not a word. At<br>
length I began. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how could you go away from me?&rdquo; to<br>
which he gave no answer, for it was impossible for him to speak.<br>
<br>
When our ecstasies were a little over, he told me he was gone about<br>
fifteen miles, but it was not in his power to go any farther without<br>
coming back to see me again, and to take his leave of me once more.<br>
<br>
I told him how I had passed my time, and how loud I had called him to<br>
come back again. He told me he heard me very plain upon Delamere<br>
Forest, at a place about twelve miles off. I smiled. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says he,<br>
&ldquo;do not think I am in jest, for if ever I heard your voice in my life,<br>
I heard you call me aloud, and sometimes I thought I saw you running<br>
after me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what did I say?&rdquo;&mdash;for I had not named the<br>
words to him. &ldquo;You called aloud,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and said, O Jemmy! O Jemmy!<br>
come back, come back.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I laughed at him. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;do not laugh, for, depend upon<br>
it, I heard your voice as plain as you hear mine now; if you please,<br>
I&rsquo;ll go before a magistrate and make oath of it.&rdquo; I then began to be<br>
amazed and surprised, and indeed frightened, and told him what I had<br>
really done, and how I had called after him, as above.<br>
<br>
When we had amused ourselves a while about this, I said to him: &ldquo;Well,<br>
you shall go away from me no more; I&rsquo;ll go all over the world with you<br>
rather.&rdquo; He told me it would be a very difficult thing for him to leave<br>
me, but since it must be, he hoped I would make it as easy to me as I<br>
could; but as for him, it would be his destruction that he foresaw.<br>
<br>
However, he told me that he considered he had left me to travel to<br>
London alone, which was too long a journey; and that as he might as<br>
well go that way as any way else, he was resolved to see me safe<br>
thither, or near it; and if he did go away then without taking his<br>
leave, I should not take it ill of him; and this he made me promise.<br>
<br>
He told me how he had dismissed his three servants, sold their horses,<br>
and sent the fellows away to seek their fortunes, and all in a little<br>
time, at a town on the road, I know not where. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it cost<br>
me some tears all alone by myself, to think how much happier they were<br>
than their master, for they could go to the next gentleman&rsquo;s house to<br>
see for a service, whereas,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I knew not wither to go, or what<br>
to do with myself.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I told him I was so completely miserable in parting with him, that I<br>
could not be worse; and that now he was come again, I would not go from<br>
him, if he would take me with him, let him go whither he would, or do<br>
what he would. And in the meantime I agreed that we would go together<br>
to London; but I could not be brought to consent he should go away at<br>
last and not take his leave of me, as he proposed to do; but told him,<br>
jesting, that if he did, I would call him back again as loud as I did<br>
before. Then I pulled out his watch and gave it him back, and his two<br>
rings, and his ten guineas; but he would not take them, which made me<br>
very much suspect that he resolved to go off upon the road and leave<br>
me.<br>
<br>
The truth is, the circumstances he was in, the passionate expressions<br>
of his letter, the kind, gentlemanly treatment I had from him in all<br>
the affair, with the concern he showed for me in it, his manner of<br>
parting with that large share which he gave me of his little stock<br>
left&mdash;all these had joined to make such impressions on me, that I really<br>
loved him most tenderly, and could not bear the thoughts of parting<br>
with him.<br>
<br>
Two days after this we quitted Chester, I in the stage-coach, and he on<br>
horseback. I dismissed my maid at Chester. He was very much against my<br>
being without a maid, but she being a servant hired in the country, and<br>
I resolving to keep no servant at London, I told him it would have been<br>
barbarous to have taken the poor wench and have turned her away as soon<br>
as I came to town; and it would also have been a needless charge on the<br>
road, so I satisfied him, and he was easy enough on the score.<br>
<br>
He came with me as far as Dunstable, within thirty miles of London, and<br>
then he told me fate and his own misfortunes obliged him to leave me,<br>
and that it was not convenient for him to go to London, for reasons<br>
which it was of no value to me to know, and I saw him preparing to go.<br>
The stage-coach we were in did not usually stop at Dunstable, but I<br>
desiring it but for a quarter of an hour, they were content to stand at<br>
an inn-door a while, and we went into the house.<br>
<br>
Being in the inn, I told him I had but one favour more to ask of him,<br>
and that was, that since he could not go any farther, he would give me<br>
leave to stay a week or two in the town with him, that we might in that<br>
time think of something to prevent such a ruinous thing to us both, as<br>
a final separation would be; and that I had something of moment to<br>
offer him, that I had never said yet, and which perhaps he might find<br>
practicable to our mutual advantage.<br>
<br>
This was too reasonable a proposal to be denied, so he called the<br>
landlady of the house, and told her his wife was taken ill, and so ill<br>
that she could not think of going any farther in the stage-coach, which<br>
had tired her almost to death, and asked if she could not get us a<br>
lodging for two or three days in a private house, where I might rest me<br>
a little, for the journey had been too much for me. The landlady, a<br>
good sort of woman, well-bred and very obliging, came immediately to<br>
see me; told me she had two or three very good rooms in a part of the<br>
house quite out of the noise, and if I saw them, she did not doubt but<br>
I would like them, and I should have one of her maids, that should do<br>
nothing else but be appointed to wait on me. This was so very kind,<br>
that I could not but accept of it, and thank her; so I went to look on<br>
the rooms and liked them very well, and indeed they were<br>
extraordinarily furnished, and very pleasant lodgings; so we paid the<br>
stage-coach, took out our baggage, and resolved to stay here a while.<br>
<br>
Here I told him I would live with him now till all my money was spent,<br>
but would not let him spend a shilling of his own. We had some kind<br>
squabble about that, but I told him it was the last time I was like to<br>
enjoy his company, and I desired he would let me be master in that<br>
thing only, and he should govern in everything else; so he acquiesced.<br>
<br>
Here one evening, taking a walk into the fields, I told him I would now<br>
make the proposal to him I had told him of; accordingly I related to<br>
him how I had lived in Virginia, that I had a mother I believed was<br>
alive there still, though my husband was dead some years. I told him<br>
that had not my effects miscarried, which, by the way, I magnified<br>
pretty much, I might have been fortune good enough to him to have kept<br>
us from being parted in this manner. Then I entered into the manner of<br>
peoples going over to those countries to settle, how they had a<br>
quantity of land given them by the Constitution of the place; and if<br>
not, that it might be purchased at so easy a rate this it was not worth<br>
naming.<br>
<br>
I then gave him a full and distinct account of the nature of planting;<br>
how with carrying over but two or three hundred pounds value in English<br>
goods, with some servants and tools, a man of application would<br>
presently lay a foundation for a family, and in a very few years be<br>
certain to raise an estate.<br>
<br>
I let him into the nature of the product of the earth; how the ground<br>
was cured and prepared, and what the usual increase of it was; and<br>
demonstrated to him, that in a very few years, with such a beginning,<br>
we should be as certain of being rich as we were now certain of being<br>
poor.<br>
<br>
He was surprised at my discourse; for we made it the whole subject of<br>
our conversation for near a week together, in which time I laid it down<br>
in black and white, as we say, that it was morally impossible, with a<br>
supposition of any reasonable good conduct, but that we must thrive<br>
there and do very well.<br>
<br>
Then I told him what measures I would take to raise such a sum of &pound;300<br>
or thereabouts; and I argued with him how good a method it would be to<br>
put an end to our misfortunes and restore our circumstances in the<br>
world, to what we had both expected; and I added, that after seven<br>
years, if we lived, we might be in a posture to leave our plantations<br>
in good hands, and come over again and receive the income of it, and<br>
live here and enjoy it; and I gave him examples of some that had done<br>
so, and lived now in very good circumstances in London.<br>
<br>
In short, I pressed him so to it, that he almost agreed to it, but<br>
still something or other broke it off again; till at last he turned the<br>
tables, and he began to talk almost to the same purpose of Ireland.<br>
<br>
He told me that a man that could confine himself to country life, and<br>
that could find but stock to enter upon any land, should have farms<br>
there for &pound;50 a year, as good as were here let for &pound;200 a year; that<br>
the produce was such, and so rich the land, that if much was not laid<br>
up, we were sure to live as handsomely upon it as a gentleman of &pound;3000<br>
a year could do in England and that he had laid a scheme to leave me in<br>
London, and go over and try; and if he found he could lay a handsome<br>
foundation of living suitable to the respect he had for me, as he<br>
doubted not he should do, he would come over and fetch me.<br>
<br>
I was dreadfully afraid that upon such a proposal he would have taken<br>
me at my word, viz. to sell my little income as I called it, and turn<br>
it into money, and let him carry it over into Ireland and try his<br>
experiment with it; but he was too just to desire it, or to have<br>
accepted it if I had offered it; and he anticipated me in that, for he<br>
added, that he would go and try his fortune that way, and if he found<br>
he could do anything at it to live, then, by adding mine to it when I<br>
went over, we should live like ourselves; but that he would not hazard<br>
a shilling of mine till he had made the experiment with a little, and<br>
he assured me that if he found nothing to be done in Ireland, he would<br>
then come to me and join in my project for Virginia.<br>
<br>
He was so earnest upon his project being to be tried first, that I<br>
could not withstand him; however, he promised to let me hear from him<br>
in a very little time after his arriving there, to let me know whether<br>
his prospect answered his design, that if there was not a possibility<br>
of success, I might take the occasion to prepare for our other voyage,<br>
and then, he assured me, he would go with me to America with all his<br>
heart.<br>
<br>
I could bring him to nothing further than this. However, those<br>
consultations entertained us near a month, during which I enjoyed his<br>
company, which indeed was the most entertaining that ever I met in my<br>
life before. In this time he let me into the whole story of his own<br>
life, which was indeed surprising, and full of an infinite variety<br>
sufficient to fill up a much brighter history, for its adventures and<br>
incidents, than any I ever saw in print; but I shall have occasion to<br>
say more of him hereafter.<br>
<br>
We parted at last, though with the utmost reluctance on my side; and<br>
indeed he took his leave very unwillingly too, but necessity obliged<br>
him, for his reasons were very good why he would not come to London, as<br>
I understood more fully some time afterwards.<br>
<br>
I gave him a direction how to write to me, though still I reserved the<br>
grand secret, and never broke my resolution, which was not to let him<br>
ever know my true name, who I was, or where to be found; he likewise<br>
let me know how to write a letter to him, so that, he said, he would be<br>
sure to receive it.<br>
<br>
I came to London the next day after we parted, but did not go directly<br>
to my old lodgings; but for another nameless reason took a private<br>
lodging in St. John&rsquo;s Street, or, as it is vulgarly called, St.<br>
Jones&rsquo;s, near Clerkenwell; and here, being perfectly alone, I had<br>
leisure to sit down and reflect seriously upon the last seven months&rsquo;<br>
ramble I had made, for I had been abroad no less. The pleasant hours I<br>
had with my last husband I looked back on with an infinite deal of<br>
pleasure; but that pleasure was very much lessened when I found some<br>
time after that I was really with child.<br>
<br>
This was a perplexing thing, because of the difficulty which was before<br>
me where I should get leave to lie in; it being one of the nicest<br>
things in the world at that time of day for a woman that was a<br>
stranger, and had no friends, to be entertained in that circumstance<br>
without security, which, by the way, I had not, neither could I procure<br>
any.<br>
<br>
I had taken care all this while to preserve a correspondence with my<br>
honest friend at the bank, or rather he took care to correspond with<br>
me, for he wrote to me once a week; and though I had not spent my money<br>
so fast as to want any from him, yet I often wrote also to let him know<br>
I was alive. I had left directions in Lancashire, so that I had these<br>
letters, which he sent, conveyed to me; and during my recess at St.<br>
Jones&rsquo;s received a very obliging letter from him, assuring me that his<br>
process for a divorce from his wife went on with success, though he met<br>
with some difficulties in it that he did not expect.<br>
<br>
I was not displeased with the news that his process was more tedious<br>
than he expected; for though I was in no condition to have him yet, not<br>
being so foolish to marry him when I knew myself to be with child by<br>
another man, as some I know have ventured to do, yet I was not willing<br>
to lose him, and, in a word, resolved to have him if he continued in<br>
the same mind, as soon as I was up again; for I saw apparently I should<br>
hear no more from my husband; and as he had all along pressed to marry,<br>
and had assured me he would not be at all disgusted at it, or ever<br>
offer to claim me again, so I made no scruple to resolve to do it if I<br>
could, and if my other friend stood to his bargain; and I had a great<br>
deal of reason to be assured that he would stand to it, by the letters<br>
he wrote to me, which were the kindest and most obliging that could be.<br>
<br>
I now grew big, and the people where I lodged perceived it, and began<br>
to take notice of it to me, and, as far as civility would allow,<br>
intimated that I must think of removing. This put me to extreme<br>
perplexity, and I grew very melancholy, for indeed I knew not what<br>
course to take. I had money, but no friends, and was like to have a<br>
child upon my hands to keep, which was a difficulty I had never had<br>
upon me yet, as the particulars of my story hitherto make appear.<br>
<br>
In the course of this affair I fell very ill, and my melancholy really<br>
increased my distemper; my illness proved at length to be only an ague,<br>
but my apprehensions were really that I should miscarry. I should not<br>
say apprehensions, for indeed I would have been glad to miscarry, but I<br>
could never be brought to entertain so much as a thought of<br>
endeavouring to miscarry, or of taking any thing to make me miscarry; I<br>
abhorred, I say, so much as the thought of it.<br>
<br>
However, speaking of it in the house, the gentlewoman who kept the<br>
house proposed to me to send for a midwife. I scrupled it at first, but<br>
after some time consented to it, but told her I had no particular<br>
acquaintance with any midwife, and so left it to her.<br>
<br>
It seems the mistress of the house was not so great a stranger to such<br>
cases as mine was as I thought at first she had been, as will appear<br>
presently, and she sent for a midwife of the right sort&mdash;that is to say,<br>
the right sort for me.<br>
<br>
The woman appeared to be an experienced woman in her business, I mean<br>
as a midwife; but she had another calling too, in which she was as<br>
expert as most women if not more. My landlady had told her I was very<br>
melancholy, and that she believed that had done me harm; and once,<br>
before me, said to her, &ldquo;Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; (meaning the midwife), &ldquo;I believe<br>
this lady&rsquo;s trouble is of a kind that is pretty much in your way, and<br>
therefore if you can do anything for her, pray do, for she is a very<br>
civil gentlewoman&rdquo;; and so she went out of the room.<br>
<br>
I really did not understand her, but my Mother Midnight began very<br>
seriously to explain what she meant, as soon as she was gone. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;<br>
says she, &ldquo;you seem not to understand what your landlady means; and<br>
when you do understand it, you need not let her know at all that you do<br>
so.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;She means that you are under some circumstances that may render your<br>
lying in difficult to you, and that you are not willing to be exposed.<br>
I need say no more, but to tell you, that if you think fit to<br>
communicate so much of your case to me, if it be so, as is necessary,<br>
for I do not desire to pry into those things, I perhaps may be in a<br>
position to help you and to make you perfectly easy, and remove all<br>
your dull thoughts upon that subject.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Every word this creature said was a cordial to me, and put new life and<br>
new spirit into my heart; my blood began to circulate immediately, and<br>
I was quite another body; I ate my victuals again, and grew better<br>
presently after it. She said a great deal more to the same purpose, and<br>
then, having pressed me to be free with her, and promised in the<br>
solemnest manner to be secret, she stopped a little, as if waiting to<br>
see what impression it made on me, and what I would say.<br>
<br>
I was too sensible to the want I was in of such a woman, not to accept<br>
her offer; I told her my case was partly as she guessed, and partly<br>
not, for I was really married, and had a husband, though he was in such<br>
fine circumstances and so remote at that time, as that he could not<br>
appear publicly.<br>
<br>
She took me short, and told me that was none of her business; all the<br>
ladies that came under her care were married women to her. &ldquo;Every<br>
woman,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;that is with child has a father for it,&rdquo; and whether<br>
that father was a husband or no husband, was no business of hers; her<br>
business was to assist me in my present circumstances, whether I had a<br>
husband or no. &ldquo;For, madam,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;to have a husband that cannot<br>
appear, is to have no husband in the sense of the case; and, therefore,<br>
whether you are a wife or a mistress is all one to me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I found presently, that whether I was a whore or a wife, I was to pass<br>
for a whore here, so I let that go. I told her it was true, as she<br>
said, but that, however, if I must tell her my case, I must tell it her<br>
as it was; so I related it to her as short as I could, and I concluded<br>
it to her thus. &ldquo;I trouble you with all this, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not<br>
that, as you said before, it is much to the purpose in your affair, but<br>
this is to the purpose, namely, that I am not in any pain about being<br>
seen, or being public or concealed, for &rsquo;tis perfectly indifferent to<br>
me; but my difficulty is, that I have no acquaintance in this part of<br>
the nation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I understand you, madam&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;you have no security to bring to<br>
prevent the parish impertinences usual in such cases, and perhaps,&rdquo;<br>
says she, &ldquo;do not know very well how to dispose of the child when it<br>
comes.&rdquo; &ldquo;The last,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is not so much my concern as the first.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Well, madam,&rdquo; answered the midwife, &ldquo;dare you put yourself into my<br>
hands? I live in such a place; though I do not inquire after you, you<br>
may inquire after me. My name is B&mdash;&mdash;; I live in such a street&rdquo;&mdash;naming<br>
the street&mdash;&ldquo;at the sign of the Cradle. My profession is a midwife, and<br>
I have many ladies that come to my house to lie in. I have given<br>
security to the parish in general terms to secure them from any charge<br>
from whatsoever shall come into the world under my roof. I have but one<br>
question to ask in the whole affair, madam,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and if that be<br>
answered you shall be entirely easy for all the rest.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I presently understood what she meant, and told her, &ldquo;Madam, I believe<br>
I understand you. I thank God, though I want friends in this part of<br>
the world, I do not want money, so far as may be necessary, though I do<br>
not abound in that neither&rdquo;: this I added because I would not make her<br>
expect great things. &ldquo;Well, madam,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;that is the thing<br>
indeed, without which nothing can be done in these cases; and yet,&rdquo;<br>
says she, &ldquo;you shall see that I will not impose upon you, or offer<br>
anything that is unkind to you, and if you desire it, you shall know<br>
everything beforehand, that you may suit yourself to the occasion, and<br>
be neither costly or sparing as you see fit.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I told her she seemed to be so perfectly sensible of my condition, that<br>
I had nothing to ask of her but this, that as I had told her that I had<br>
money sufficient, but not a great quantity, she would order it so that<br>
I might be at as little superfluous charge as possible.<br>
<br>
She replied that she would bring in an account of the expenses of it in<br>
two or three shapes, and like a bill of fare, I should choose as I<br>
pleased; and I desired her to do so.<br>
<br>
The next day she brought it, and the copy of her three bills was as<br>
follows:&mdash;<br>
<br>
1. For three months&rsquo; lodging in her house, including my diet, at 10s.<br>
a week . . . . . . . . . . . 6&pound;, 0s., 0d.<br>
2. For a nurse for the month, and use of childbed linen . . . . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . 1&pound;, 10s., 0d.<br>
3. For a minister to christen the child, and to the godfathers and<br>
clerk . . . . . . . . . . . . 1&pound;, 10s., 0d.<br>
4. For a supper at the christening if I had five friends at it . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1&pound;, 0s., 0d.<br>
 For her fees as a midwife, and the taking off the trouble of the<br>
 parish . . . . . . . . . . . . 3&pound;, 3s., 0d.<br>
 To her maid servant attending . . . . . . . . 0&pound;, 10s., 0d.<br>
 -------------- 13&pound;, 13s., 0d.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was the first bill; the second was the same terms:&mdash;<br>
<br>
1. For three months&rsquo; lodging and diet, etc., at 20s. per week . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13&pound;, 0s., 0d.<br>
2. For a nurse for the month, and the use of linen and lace . . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . 2&pound;, 10s., 0d.<br>
3. For the minister to christen the child, etc., as above . . . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2&pound;, 0s., 0d.<br>
4. For supper and for sweetmeats . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
. . . . 3&pound;, 3s., 0d.<br>
 For her fees as above . . . . . . . . . . . . 5&pound;, 5s., 0d.<br>
 For a servant-maid . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1&pound;, 0s., 0d.<br>
 -------------- 26&pound;, 18s., 0d.<br>
<br>
<br>
This was the second-rate bill; the third, she said, was for a degree<br>
higher, and when the father or friends appeared:&mdash;<br>
<br>
1. For three months&rsquo; lodging and diet, having two rooms and a garret<br>
for a servant . . . . . . 30&pound;, 0s., 0d.,<br>
2. For a nurse for the month, and the finest suit of childbed linen .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . . . . 4&pound;, 4s., 0d.<br>
3. For the minister to christen the child, etc. 2&pound;, 10s., 0d.<br>
4. For a supper, the gentlemen to send in the wine . . . . . . . . . .<br>
. . . . . . . . . . 6&pound;, 0s., 0d.<br>
 For my fees, etc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10&pound;, 10s., 0d.<br>
 The maid, besides their own maid, only . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br>
 . . . . . . . . . 0&pound;, 10s., 0d. -------------- 53&pound;, 14s., 0d.<br>
<br>
I looked upon all three bills, and smiled, and told her I did not see<br>
but that she was very reasonable in her demands, all things considered,<br>
and for that I did not doubt but her accommodations were good.<br>
<br>
She told me I should be judge of that when I saw them. I told her I was<br>
sorry to tell her that I feared I must be her lowest-rated customer.<br>
&ldquo;And perhaps, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will make me the less welcome upon<br>
that account.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not at all,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;for where I have one of the<br>
third sort I have two of the second, and four to one of the first, and<br>
I get as much by them in proportion as by any; but if you doubt my care<br>
of you, I will allow any friend you have to overlook and see if you are<br>
well waited on or no.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then she explained the particulars of her bill. &ldquo;In the first place,<br>
madam,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I would have you observe that here is three months&rsquo;<br>
keeping; you are but ten shillings a week; I undertake to say you will<br>
not complain of my table. I suppose,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you do not live<br>
cheaper where you are now?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not so cheap, for I<br>
give six shillings per week for my chamber, and find my own diet as<br>
well as I can, which costs me a great deal more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Then, madam,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;if the child should not live, or should be<br>
dead-born, as you know sometimes happens, then there is the minister&rsquo;s<br>
article saved; and if you have no friends to come to you, you may save<br>
the expense of a supper; so that take those articles out, madam,&rdquo; says<br>
she, &ldquo;your lying in will not cost you above &pound;5, 3s. in all more than<br>
your ordinary charge of living.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was the most reasonable thing that I ever heard of; so I smiled,<br>
and told her I would come and be her customer; but I told her also,<br>
that as I had two months and more to do, I might perhaps be obliged to<br>
stay longer with her than three months, and desired to know if she<br>
would not be obliged to remove me before it was proper. No, she said;<br>
her house was large, and besides, she never put anybody to remove, that<br>
had lain in, till they were willing to go; and if she had more ladies<br>
offered, she was not so ill-beloved among her neighbours but she could<br>
provide accommodations for twenty, if there was occasion.<br>
<br>
I found she was an eminent lady in her way; and, in short, I agreed to<br>
put myself into her hands, and promised her. She then talked of other<br>
things, looked about into my accommodations where I was, found fault<br>
with my wanting attendance and conveniences, and that I should not be<br>
used so at her house. I told her I was shy of speaking, for the woman<br>
of the house looked stranger, or at least I thought so, since I had<br>
been ill, because I was with child; and I was afraid she would put some<br>
affront or other upon me, supposing that I had been able to give but a<br>
slight account of myself.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;her ladyship is no stranger to these things; she<br>
has tried to entertain ladies in your condition several times, but she<br>
could not secure the parish; and besides, she is not such a nice lady<br>
as you take her to be; however, since you are a-going, you shall not<br>
meddle with her, but I&rsquo;ll see you are a little better looked after<br>
while you are here than I think you are, and it shall not cost you the<br>
more neither.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I did not understand her at all; however, I thanked her, and so we<br>
parted. The next morning she sent me a chicken roasted and hot, and a<br>
pint bottle of sherry, and ordered the maid to tell me that she was to<br>
wait on me every day as long as I stayed there.<br>
<br>
This was surprisingly good and kind, and I accepted it very willingly.<br>
At night she sent to me again, to know if I wanted anything, and how I<br>
did, and to order the maid to come to her in the morning with my<br>
dinner. The maid had orders to make me some chocolate in the morning<br>
before she came away, and did so, and at noon she brought me the<br>
sweetbread of a breast of veal, whole, and a dish of soup for my<br>
dinner; and after this manner she nursed me up at a distance, so that I<br>
was mightily well pleased, and quickly well, for indeed my dejections<br>
before were the principal part of my illness.<br>
<br>
I expected, as is usually the case among such people, that the servant<br>
she sent me would have been some imprudent brazen wench of Drury Lane<br>
breeding, and I was very uneasy at having her with me upon that<br>
account; so I would not let her lie in that house the first night by<br>
any means, but had my eyes about me as narrowly as if she had been a<br>
public thief.<br>
<br>
My gentlewoman guessed presently what was the matter, and sent her back<br>
with a short note, that I might depend upon the honesty of her maid;<br>
that she would be answerable for her upon all accounts; and that she<br>
took no servants into her house without very good security for their<br>
fidelity. I was then perfectly easy; and indeed the maid&rsquo;s behaviour<br>
spoke for itself, for a modester, quieter, soberer girl never came into<br>
anybody&rsquo;s family, and I found her so afterwards.<br>
<br>
As soon as I was well enough to go abroad, I went with the maid to see<br>
the house, and to see the apartment I was to have; and everything was<br>
so handsome and so clean and well, that, in short, I had nothing to<br>
say, but was wonderfully pleased and satisfied with what I had met<br>
with, which, considering the melancholy circumstances I was in, was far<br>
beyond what I looked for.<br>
<br>
It might be expected that I should give some account of the nature of<br>
the wicked practices of this woman, in whose hands I was now fallen;<br>
but it would be too much encouragement to the vice, to let the world<br>
see what easy measures were here taken to rid the women&rsquo;s unwelcome<br>
burthen of a child clandestinely gotten. This grave matron had several<br>
sorts of practice, and this was one particular, that if a child was<br>
born, though not in her house (for she had occasion to be called to<br>
many private labours), she had people at hand, who for a piece of money<br>
would take the child off their hands, and off from the hands of the<br>
parish too; and those children, as she said, were honestly provided for<br>
and taken care of. What should become of them all, considering so many,<br>
as by her account she was concerned with, I cannot conceive.<br>
<br>
I had many times discourses upon that subject with her; but she was<br>
full of this argument, that she save the life of many an innocent lamb,<br>
as she called them, which would otherwise perhaps have been murdered;<br>
and of many women who, made desperate by the misfortune, would<br>
otherwise be tempted to destroy their children, and bring themselves to<br>
the gallows. I granted her that this was true, and a very commendable<br>
thing, provided the poor children fell into good hands afterwards, and<br>
were not abused, starved, and neglected by the nurses that bred them<br>
up. She answered, that she always took care of that, and had no nurses<br>
in her business but what were very good, honest people, and such as<br>
might be depended upon.<br>
<br>
I could say nothing to the contrary, and so was obliged to say, &ldquo;Madam,<br>
I do not question you do your part honestly, but what those people do<br>
afterwards is the main question&rdquo;; and she stopped my mouth again with<br>
saying that she took the utmost care about it.<br>
<br>
The only thing I found in all her conversation on these subjects that<br>
gave me any distaste, was, that one time in discouraging about my being<br>
far gone with child, and the time I expected to come, she said<br>
something that looked as if she could help me off with my burthen<br>
sooner, if I was willing; or, in English, that she could give me<br>
something to make me miscarry, if I had a desire to put an end to my<br>
troubles that way; but I soon let her see that I abhorred the thoughts<br>
of it; and, to do her justice, she put it off so cleverly, that I could<br>
not say she really intended it, or whether she only mentioned the<br>
practice as a horrible thing; for she couched her words so well, and<br>
took my meaning so quickly, that she gave her negative before I could<br>
explain myself.<br>
<br>
To bring this part into as narrow a compass as possible, I quitted my<br>
lodging at St. Jones&rsquo;s and went to my new governess, for so they called<br>
her in the house, and there I was indeed treated with so much courtesy,<br>
so carefully looked to, so handsomely provided, and everything so well,<br>
that I was surprised at it, and could not at first see what advantage<br>
my governess made of it; but I found afterwards that she professed to<br>
make no profit of lodgers&rsquo; diet, nor indeed could she get much by it,<br>
but that her profit lay in the other articles of her management, and<br>
she made enough that way, I assure you; for &rsquo;tis scarce credible what<br>
practice she had, as well abroad as at home, and yet all upon the<br>
private account, or, in plain English, the whoring account.<br>
<br>
While I was in her house, which was near four months, she had no less<br>
than twelve ladies of pleasure brought to bed within the doors, and I<br>
think she had two-and-thirty, or thereabouts, under her conduct without<br>
doors, whereof one, as nice as she was with me, was lodged with my old<br>
landlady at St. Jones&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
This was a strange testimony of the growing vice of the age, and such a<br>
one, that as bad as I had been myself, it shocked my very senses. I<br>
began to nauseate the place I was in and, about all, the wicked<br>
practice; and yet I must say that I never saw, or do I believe there<br>
was to be seen, the least indecency in the house the whole time I was<br>
there.<br>
<br>
Not a man was ever seen to come upstairs, except to visit the lying-in<br>
ladies within their month, nor then without the old lady with them, who<br>
made it a piece of honour of her management that no man should touch a<br>
woman, no, not his own wife, within the month; nor would she permit any<br>
man to lie in the house upon any pretence whatever, no, not though she<br>
was sure it was with his own wife; and her general saying for it was,<br>
that she cared not how many children were born in her house, but she<br>
would have none got there if she could help it.<br>
<br>
It might perhaps be carried further than was needful, but it was an<br>
error of the right hand if it was an error, for by this she kept up the<br>
reputation, such as it was, of her business, and obtained this<br>
character, that though she did take care of the women when they were<br>
debauched, yet she was not instrumental to their being debauched at<br>
all; and yet it was a wicked trade she drove too.<br>
<br>
While I was there, and before I was brought to bed, I received a letter<br>
from my trustee at the bank, full of kind, obliging things, and<br>
earnestly pressing me to return to London. It was near a fortnight old<br>
when it came to me, because it had been first sent into Lancashire, and<br>
then returned to me. He concludes with telling me that he had obtained<br>
a decree, I think he called it, against his wife, and that he would be<br>
ready to make good his engagement to me, if I would accept of him,<br>
adding a great many protestations of kindness and affection, such as he<br>
would have been far from offering if he had known the circumstances I<br>
had been in, and which as it was I had been very far from deserving.<br>
<br>
I returned an answer to his letter, and dated it at Liverpool, but sent<br>
it by messenger, alleging that it came in cover to a friend in town. I<br>
gave him joy of his deliverance, but raised some scruples at the<br>
lawfulness of his marrying again, and told him I supposed he would<br>
consider very seriously upon that point before he resolved on it, the<br>
consequence being too great for a man of his judgment to venture rashly<br>
upon a thing of that nature; so concluded, wishing him very well in<br>
whatever he resolved, without letting him into anything of my own mind,<br>
or giving any answer to his proposal of my coming to London to him, but<br>
mentioned at a distance my intention to return the latter end of the<br>
year, this being dated in April.<br>
<br>
I was brought to bed about the middle of May and had another brave boy,<br>
and myself in as good condition as usual on such occasions. My<br>
governess did her part as a midwife with the greatest art and dexterity<br>
imaginable, and far beyond all that ever I had had any experience of<br>
before.<br>
<br>
Her care of me in my travail, and after in my lying in, was such, that<br>
if she had been my own mother it could not have been better. Let none<br>
be encouraged in their loose practices from this dexterous lady&rsquo;s<br>
management, for she is gone to her place, and I dare say has left<br>
nothing behind her that can or will come up on it.<br>
<br>
I think I had been brought to bed about twenty-two days when I received<br>
another letter from my friend at the bank, with the surprising news<br>
that he had obtained a final sentence of divorce against his wife, and<br>
had served her with it on such a day, and that he had such an answer to<br>
give to all my scruples about his marrying again, as I could not<br>
expect, and as he had no desire of; for that his wife, who had been<br>
under some remorse before for her usage of him, as soon as she had the<br>
account that he had gained his point, had very unhappily destroyed<br>
herself that same evening.<br>
<br>
He expressed himself very handsomely as to his being concerned at her<br>
disaster, but cleared himself of having any hand in it, and that he had<br>
only done himself justice in a case in which he was notoriously injured<br>
and abused. However, he said that he was extremely afflicted at it, and<br>
had no view of any satisfaction left in his world, but only in the hope<br>
that I would come and relieve him by my company; and then he pressed me<br>
violently indeed to give him some hopes that I would at least come up<br>
to town and let him see me, when he would further enter into discourse<br>
about it.<br>
<br>
I was exceedingly surprised at the news, and began now seriously to<br>
reflect on my present circumstances, and the inexpressible misfortune<br>
it was to me to have a child upon my hands, and what to do in it I knew<br>
not. At last I opened my case at a distance to my governess. I appeared<br>
melancholy and uneasy for several days, and she lay at me continually<br>
to know what trouble me. I could not for my life tell her that I had an<br>
offer of marriage, after I had so often told her that I had a husband,<br>
so that I really knew not what to say to her. I owned I had something<br>
which very much troubled me, but at the same time told her I could not<br>
speak of it to any one alive.<br>
<br>
She continued importuning me several days, but it was impossible, I<br>
told her, for me to commit the secret to anybody. This, instead of<br>
being an answer to her, increased her importunities; she urged her<br>
having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature, that it<br>
was her business to conceal everything, and that to discover things of<br>
that nature would be her ruin. She asked me if ever I had found her<br>
tattling to me of other people&rsquo;s affairs, and how could I suspect her?<br>
She told me, to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody; that she<br>
was silent as death; that it must be a very strange case indeed that<br>
she could not help me out of; but to conceal it was to deprive myself<br>
of all possible help, or means of help, and to deprive her of the<br>
opportunity of serving me. In short, she had such a bewitching<br>
eloquence, and so great a power of persuasion that there was no<br>
concealing anything from her.<br>
<br>
So I resolved to unbosom myself to her. I told her the history of my<br>
Lancashire marriage, and how both of us had been disappointed; how we<br>
came together, and how we parted; how he absolutely discharged me, as<br>
far as lay in him, free liberty to marry again, protesting that if he<br>
knew it he would never claim me, or disturb or expose me; that I<br>
thought I was free, but was dreadfully afraid to venture, for fear of<br>
the consequences that might follow in case of a discovery.<br>
<br>
Then I told her what a good offer I had; showed her my friend&rsquo;s two<br>
last letters, inviting me to come to London, and let her see with what<br>
affection and earnestness they were written, but blotted out the name,<br>
and also the story about the disaster of his wife, only that she was<br>
dead.<br>
<br>
She fell a-laughing at my scruples about marrying, and told me the<br>
other was no marriage, but a cheat on both sides; and that, as we were<br>
parted by mutual consent, the nature of the contract was destroyed, and<br>
the obligation was mutually discharged. She had arguments for this at<br>
the tip of her tongue; and, in short, reasoned me out of my reason; not<br>
but that it was too by the help of my own inclination.<br>
<br>
But then came the great and main difficulty, and that was the child;<br>
this, she told me in so many words, must be removed, and that so as<br>
that it should never be possible for any one to discover it. I knew<br>
there was no marrying without entirely concealing that I had had a<br>
child, for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was<br>
born, nay, and gotten too, since my parley with him, and that would<br>
have destroyed all the affair.<br>
<br>
But it touched my heart so forcibly to think of parting entirely with<br>
the child, and, for aught I knew, of having it murdered, or starved by<br>
neglect and ill-usage (which was much the same), that I could not think<br>
of it without horror. I wish all those women who consent to the<br>
disposing their children out of the way, as it is called, for decency<br>
sake, would consider that &rsquo;tis only a contrived method for murder; that<br>
is to say, a-killing their children with safety.<br>
<br>
It is manifest to all that understand anything of children, that we are<br>
born into the world helpless, and incapable either to supply our own<br>
wants or so much as make them known; and that without help we must<br>
perish; and this help requires not only an assisting hand, whether of<br>
the mother or somebody else, but there are two things necessary in that<br>
assisting hand, that is, care and skill; without both which, half the<br>
children that are born would die, nay, though they were not to be<br>
denied food; and one half more of those that remained would be cripples<br>
or fools, lose their limbs, and perhaps their sense. I question not but<br>
that these are partly the reasons why affection was placed by nature in<br>
the hearts of mothers to their children; without which they would never<br>
be able to give themselves up, as &rsquo;tis necessary they should, to the<br>
care and waking pains needful to the support of their children.<br>
<br>
Since this care is needful to the life of children, to neglect them is<br>
to murder them; again, to give them up to be managed by those people<br>
who have none of that needful affection placed by nature in them, is to<br>
neglect them in the highest degree; nay, in some it goes farther, and<br>
is a neglect in order to their being lost; so that &rsquo;tis even an<br>
intentional murder, whether the child lives or dies.<br>
<br>
All those things represented themselves to my view, and that is the<br>
blackest and most frightful form: and as I was very free with my<br>
governess, whom I had now learned to call mother, I represented to her<br>
all the dark thoughts which I had upon me about it, and told her what<br>
distress I was in. She seemed graver by much at this part than at the<br>
other; but as she was hardened in these things beyond all possibility<br>
of being touched with the religious part, and the scruples about the<br>
murder, so she was equally impenetrable in that part which related to<br>
affection. She asked me if she had not been careful and tender to me in<br>
my lying in, as if I had been her own child. I told her I owned she<br>
had. &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and when you are gone, what are you to<br>
me? And what would it be to me if you were to be hanged? Do you think<br>
there are not women who, as it is their trade and they get their bread<br>
by it, value themselves upon their being as careful of children as<br>
their own mothers can be, and understand it rather better? Yes, yes,<br>
child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;fear it not; how were we nursed ourselves? Are you<br>
sure you was nursed up by your own mother? and yet you look fat and<br>
fair, child,&rdquo; says the old beldam; and with that she stroked me over<br>
the face. &ldquo;Never be concerned, child,&rdquo; says she, going on in her<br>
drolling way; &ldquo;I have no murderers about me; I employ the best and the<br>
honestest nurses that can be had, and have as few children miscarry<br>
under their hands as there would if they were all nursed by mothers; we<br>
want neither care nor skill.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She touched me to the quick when she asked if I was sure that I was<br>
nursed by my own mother; on the contrary I was sure I was not; and I<br>
trembled, and looked pale at the very expression. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said I to<br>
myself, &ldquo;this creature cannot be a witch, or have any conversation with<br>
a spirit, that can inform her what was done with me before I was able<br>
to know it myself&rdquo;; and I looked at her as if I had been frightened;<br>
but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know anything<br>
about me, that disorder went off, and I began to be easy, but it was<br>
not presently.<br>
<br>
She perceived the disorder I was in, but did not know the meaning of<br>
it; so she ran on in her wild talk upon the weakness of my supposing<br>
that children were murdered because they were not all nursed by the<br>
mother, and to persuade me that the children she disposed of were as<br>
well used as if the mothers had the nursing of them themselves.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It may be true, mother,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for aught I know, but my doubts are<br>
very strongly grounded indeed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s hear<br>
some of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, first,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you give a piece of money to<br>
these people to take the child off the parent&rsquo;s hands, and to take care<br>
of it as long as it lives. Now we know, mother,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that those<br>
are poor people, and their gain consists in being quit of the charge as<br>
soon as they can; how can I doubt but that, as it is best for them to<br>
have the child die, they are not over solicitous about life?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;This is all vapours and fancy,&rdquo; says the old woman; &ldquo;I tell you their<br>
credit depends upon the child&rsquo;s life, and they are as careful as any<br>
mother of you all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;O mother,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if I was but sure my little baby would be<br>
carefully looked to, and have justice done it, I should be happy<br>
indeed; but it is impossible I can be satisfied in that point unless I<br>
saw it, and to see it would be ruin and destruction to me, as now my<br>
case stands; so what to do I know not.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;A fine story!&rdquo; says the governess. &ldquo;You would see the child, and you<br>
would not see the child; you would be concealed and discovered both<br>
together. These are things impossible, my dear; so you must e&rsquo;en do as<br>
other conscientious mothers have done before you, and be contented with<br>
things as they must be, though they are not as you wish them to be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I understood what she meant by conscientious mothers; she would have<br>
said conscientious whores, but she was not willing to disoblige me, for<br>
really in this case I was not a whore, because legally married, the<br>
force of former marriage excepted.<br>
<br>
However, let me be what I would, I was not come up to that pitch of<br>
hardness common to the profession; I mean, to be unnatural, and<br>
regardless of the safety of my child; and I preserved this honest<br>
affection so long, that I was upon the point of giving up my friend at<br>
the bank, who lay so hard at me to come to him and marry him, that, in<br>
short, there was hardly any room to deny him.<br>
<br>
At last my old governess came to me, with her usual assurance. &ldquo;Come,<br>
my dear,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I have found out a way how you shall be at a<br>
certainty that your child shall be used well, and yet the people that<br>
take care of it shall never know you, or who the mother of the child<br>
is.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Oh mother,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if you can do so, you will engage me to you for<br>
ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;are you willing to be a some small annual<br>
expense, more than what we usually give to the people we contract<br>
with?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;with all my heart, provided I may be concealed.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;As to that,&rdquo; says the governess, &ldquo;you shall be secure, for the nurse<br>
shall never so much as dare to inquire about you, and you shall once or<br>
twice a year go with me and see your child, and see how &rsquo;tis used, and<br>
be satisfied that it is in good hands, nobody knowing who you are.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you think, mother, that when I come to see my child,<br>
I shall be able to conceal my being the mother of it? Do you think that<br>
possible?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says my governess, &ldquo;if you discover it, the nurse shall<br>
be never the wiser; for she shall be forbid to ask any questions about<br>
you, or to take any notice. If she offers it, she shall lose the money<br>
which you are suppose to give her, and the child shall be taken from<br>
her too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was very well pleased with this. So the next week a countrywoman was<br>
brought from Hertford, or thereabouts, who was to take the child off<br>
our hands entirely for &pound;10 in money. But if I would allow &pound;5 a year<br>
more of her, she would be obliged to bring the child to my governess&rsquo;s<br>
house as often as we desired, or we should come down and look at it,<br>
and see how well she used it.<br>
<br>
The woman was very wholesome-looking, a likely woman, a cottager&rsquo;s<br>
wife, but she had very good clothes and linen, and everything well<br>
about her; and with a heavy heart and many a tear, I let her have my<br>
child. I had been down at Hertford, and looked at her and at her<br>
dwelling, which I liked well enough; and I promised her great things if<br>
she would be kind to the child, so she knew at first word that I was<br>
the child&rsquo;s mother. But she seemed to be so much out of the way, and to<br>
have no room to inquire after me, that I thought I was safe enough. So,<br>
in short, I consented to let her have the child, and I gave her &pound;10;<br>
that is to say, I gave it to my governess, who gave it the poor woman<br>
before my face, she agreeing never to return the child back to me, or<br>
to claim anything more for its keeping or bringing up; only that I<br>
promised, if she took a great deal of care of it, I would give her<br>
something more as often as I came to see it; so that I was not bound to<br>
pay the &pound;5, only that I promised my governess I would do it. And thus<br>
my great care was over, after a manner, which though it did not at all<br>
satisfy my mind, yet was the most convenient for me, as my affairs then<br>
stood, of any that could be thought of at that time.<br>
<br>
I then began to write to my friend at the bank in a more kindly style,<br>
and particularly about the beginning of July I sent him a letter, that<br>
I proposed to be in town some time in August. He returned me an answer<br>
in the most passionate terms imaginable, and desired me to let him have<br>
timely notice, and he would come and meet me, two day&rsquo;s journey. This<br>
puzzled me scurvily, and I did not know what answer to make of it. Once<br>
I resolved to take the stage-coach to West Chester, on purpose only to<br>
have the satisfaction of coming back, that he might see me really come<br>
in the same coach; for I had a jealous thought, though I had no ground<br>
for it at all, lest he should think I was not really in the country.<br>
And it was no ill-grounded thought as you shall hear presently.<br>
<br>
I endeavoured to reason myself out of it, but it was in vain; the<br>
impression lay so strong on my mind, that it was not to be resisted. At<br>
last it came as an addition to my new design of going into the country,<br>
that it would be an excellent blind to my old governess, and would<br>
cover entirely all my other affairs, for she did not know in the least<br>
whether my new lover lived in London or in Lancashire; and when I told<br>
her my resolution, she was fully persuaded it was in Lancashire.<br>
<br>
Having taken my measure for this journey I let her know it, and sent<br>
the maid that tended me, from the beginning, to take a place for me in<br>
the coach. She would have had me let the maid have waited on me down to<br>
the last stage, and come up again in the waggon, but I convinced her it<br>
would not be convenient. When I went away, she told me she would enter<br>
into no measures for correspondence, for she saw evidently that my<br>
affection to my child would cause me to write to her, and to visit her<br>
too when I came to town again. I assured her it would, and so took my<br>
leave, well satisfied to have been freed from such a house, however<br>
good my accommodations there had been, as I have related above.<br>
<br>
I took the place in the coach not to its full extent, but to a place<br>
called Stone, in Cheshire, I think it is, where I not only had no<br>
manner of business, but not so much as the least acquaintance with any<br>
person in the town or near it. But I knew that with money in the pocket<br>
one is at home anywhere; so I lodged there two or three days, till,<br>
watching my opportunity, I found room in another stage-coach, and took<br>
passage back again for London, sending a letter to my gentleman that I<br>
should be such a certain day at Stony-Stratford, where the coachman<br>
told me he was to lodge.<br>
<br>
It happened to be a chance coach that I had taken up, which, having<br>
been hired on purpose to carry some gentlemen to West Chester who were<br>
going for Ireland, was now returning, and did not tie itself to exact<br>
times or places as the stages did; so that, having been obliged to lie<br>
still on Sunday, he had time to get himself ready to come out, which<br>
otherwise he could not have done.<br>
<br>
However, his warning was so short, that he could not reach to<br>
Stony-Stratford time enough to be with me at night, but he met me at a<br>
place called Brickhill the next morning, as we were just coming in to<br>
tow.<br>
<br>
I confess I was very glad to see him, for I had thought myself a little<br>
disappointed over-night, seeing I had gone so far to contrive my coming<br>
on purpose. He pleased me doubly too by the figure he came in, for he<br>
brought a very handsome (gentleman&rsquo;s) coach and four horses, with a<br>
servant to attend him.<br>
<br>
He took me out of the stage-coach immediately, which stopped at an inn<br>
in Brickhill; and putting into the same inn, he set up his own coach,<br>
and bespoke his dinner. I asked him what he meant by that, for I was<br>
for going forward with the journey. He said, No, I had need of a little<br>
rest upon the road, and that was a very good sort of a house, though it<br>
was but a little town; so we would go no farther that night, whatever<br>
came of it.<br>
<br>
I did not press him much, for since he had come so to meet me, and put<br>
himself to so much expense, it was but reasonable I should oblige him a<br>
little too; so I was easy as to that point.<br>
<br>
After dinner we walked to see the town, to see the church, and to view<br>
the fields, and the country, as is usual for strangers to do; and our<br>
landlord was our guide in going to see the church. I observed my<br>
gentleman inquired pretty much about the parson, and I took the hint<br>
immediately that he certainly would propose to be married; and though<br>
it was a sudden thought, it followed presently, that, in short, I would<br>
not refuse him; for, to be plain, with my circumstances I was in no<br>
condition now to say No; I had no reason now to run any more such<br>
hazards.<br>
<br>
But while these thoughts ran round in my head, which was the work but<br>
of a few moments, I observed my landlord took him aside and whispered<br>
to him, though not very softly neither, for so much I overheard: &ldquo;Sir,<br>
if you shall have occasion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; the rest I could not hear, but it seems<br>
it was to this purpose: &ldquo;Sir, if you shall have occasion for a<br>
minister, I have a friend a little way off that will serve you, and be<br>
as private as you please.&rdquo; My gentleman answered loud enough for me to<br>
hear, &ldquo;Very well, I believe I shall.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was no sooner come back to the inn but he fell upon me with<br>
irresistible words, that since he had had the good fortune to meet me,<br>
and everything concurred, it would be hastening his felicity if I would<br>
put an end to the matter just there. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; says I,<br>
colouring a little. &ldquo;What, in an inn, and upon the road! Bless us all,&rdquo;<br>
said I, as if I had been surprised, &ldquo;how can you talk so?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, I can<br>
talk so very well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I came a-purpose to talk so, and I&rsquo;ll<br>
show you that I did&rdquo;; and with that he pulls out a great bundle of<br>
papers. &ldquo;You fright me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what are all these?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be<br>
frighted, my dear,&rdquo; said he, and kissed me. This was the first time<br>
that he had been so free to call me &ldquo;my dear&rdquo;; then he repeated it,<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frighted; you shall see what it is all&rdquo;; then he laid them<br>
all abroad. There was first the deed or sentence of divorce from his<br>
wife, and the full evidence of her playing the whore; then there were<br>
the certificates of the minister and churchwardens of the parish where<br>
she lived, proving that she was buried, and intimating the manner of<br>
her death; the copy of the coroner&rsquo;s warrant for a jury to sit upon<br>
her, and the verdict of the jury, who brought it in Non compos mentis.<br>
All this was indeed to the purpose, and to give me satisfaction,<br>
though, by the way, I was not so scrupulous, had he known all, but that<br>
I might have taken him without it. However, I looked them all over as<br>
well as I could, and told him that this was all very clear indeed, but<br>
that he need not have given himself the trouble to have brought them<br>
out with him, for it was time enough. Well, he said, it might be time<br>
enough for me, but no time but the present time was time enough for<br>
him.<br>
<br>
There were other papers rolled up, and I asked him what they were.<br>
&ldquo;Why, ay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the question I wanted to have you ask me&rdquo;;<br>
so he unrolls them and takes out a little shagreen case, and gives me<br>
out of it a very fine diamond ring. I could not refuse it, if I had a<br>
mind to do so, for he put it upon my finger; so I made him a curtsy and<br>
accepted it. Then he takes out another ring: &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is<br>
for another occasion,&rdquo; so he puts that in his pocket. &ldquo;Well, but let me<br>
see it, though,&rdquo; says I, and smiled; &ldquo;I guess what it is; I think you<br>
are mad.&rdquo; &ldquo;I should have been mad if I had done less,&rdquo; says he, and<br>
still he did not show me, and I had a great mind to see it; so I says,<br>
&ldquo;Well, but let me see it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hold,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;first look here&rdquo;; then he<br>
took up the roll again and read it, and behold! it was a licence for us<br>
to be married. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;are you distracted? Why, you were fully<br>
satisfied that I would comply and yield at first word, or resolved to<br>
take no denial.&rdquo; &ldquo;The last is certainly the case,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you<br>
may be mistaken,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;how can you think so? I<br>
must not be denied, I can&rsquo;t be denied&rdquo;; and with that he fell to<br>
kissing me so violently, I could not get rid of him.<br>
<br>
There was a bed in the room, and we were walking to and again, eager in<br>
the discourse; at last he takes me by surprise in his arms, and threw<br>
me on the bed and himself with me, and holding me fast in his arms, but<br>
without the least offer of any indecency, courted me to consent with<br>
such repeated entreaties and arguments, protesting his affection, and<br>
vowing he would not let me go till I had promised him, that at last I<br>
said, &ldquo;Why, you resolve not to be denied, indeed, I can&rsquo;t be denied.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said I, and giving him a slight kiss, &ldquo;then you shan&rsquo;t be<br>
denied,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;let me get up.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was so transported with my consent, and the kind manner of it, that<br>
I began to think once he took it for a marriage, and would not stay for<br>
the form; but I wronged him, for he gave over kissing me, and then<br>
giving me two or three kisses again, thanked me for my kind yielding to<br>
him; and was so overcome with the satisfaction and joy of it, that I<br>
saw tears stand in his eyes.<br>
<br>
I turned from him, for it filled my eyes with tears too, and I asked<br>
him leave to retire a little to my chamber. If ever I had a grain of<br>
true repentance for a vicious and abominable life for twenty-four years<br>
past, it was then. Oh, what a felicity is it to mankind, said I to<br>
myself, that they cannot see into the hearts of one another! How happy<br>
had it been for me if I had been wife to a man of so much honesty, and<br>
so much affection from the beginning!<br>
<br>
Then it occurred to me, &ldquo;What an abominable creature am I! and how is<br>
this innocent gentleman going to be abused by me! How little does he<br>
think, that having divorced a whore, he is throwing himself into the<br>
arms of another! that he is going to marry one that has lain with two<br>
brothers, and has had three children by her own brother! one that was<br>
born in Newgate, whose mother was a whore, and is now a transported<br>
thief! one that has lain with thirteen men, and has had a child since<br>
he saw me! Poor gentleman!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what is he going to do?&rdquo; After<br>
this reproaching myself was over, it following thus: &ldquo;Well, if I must<br>
be his wife, if it please God to give me grace, I&rsquo;ll be a true wife to<br>
him, and love him suitably to the strange excess of his passion for me;<br>
I will make him amends if possible, by what he shall see, for the<br>
cheats and abuses I put upon him, which he does not see.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was impatient for my coming out of my chamber, but finding me long,<br>
he went downstairs and talked with my landlord about the parson.<br>
<br>
My landlord, an officious though well-meaning fellow, had sent away for<br>
the neighbouring clergyman; and when my gentleman began to speak of it<br>
to him, and talk of sending for him, &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says he to him, &ldquo;my friend<br>
is in the house&rdquo;; so without any more words he brought them together.<br>
When he came to the minister, he asked him if he would venture to marry<br>
a couple of strangers that were both willing. The parson said that Mr.<br>
&mdash;&mdash; had said something to him of it; that he hoped it was no clandestine<br>
business; that he seemed to be a grave gentleman, and he supposed madam<br>
was not a girl, so that the consent of friends should be wanted. &ldquo;To<br>
put you out of doubt of that,&rdquo; says my gentleman, &ldquo;read this paper&rdquo;;<br>
and out he pulls the license. &ldquo;I am satisfied,&rdquo; says the minister;<br>
&ldquo;where is the lady?&rdquo; &ldquo;You shall see her presently,&rdquo; says my gentleman.<br>
<br>
When he had said thus he comes upstairs, and I was by that time come<br>
out of my room; so he tells me the minister was below, and that he had<br>
talked with him, and that upon showing him the license, he was free to<br>
marry us with all his heart, &ldquo;but he asks to see you&rdquo;; so he asked if I<br>
would let him come up.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis time enough,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in the morning, is it not?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said<br>
he, &ldquo;my dear, he seemed to scruple whether it was not some young girl<br>
stolen from her parents, and I assured him we were both of age to<br>
command our own consent; and that made him ask to see you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;<br>
said I, &ldquo;do as you please&rdquo;; so up they brings the parson, and a merry,<br>
good sort of gentleman he was. He had been told, it seems, that we had<br>
met there by accident, that I came in the Chester coach, and my<br>
gentleman in his own coach to meet me; that we were to have met last<br>
night at Stony-Stratford, but that he could not reach so far. &ldquo;Well,<br>
sir,&rdquo; says the parson, &ldquo;every ill turn has some good in it. The<br>
disappointment, sir,&rdquo; says he to my gentleman, &ldquo;was yours, and the good<br>
turn is mine, for if you had met at Stony-Stratford I had not had the<br>
honour to marry you. Landlord, have you a Common Prayer Book?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I started as if I had been frightened. &ldquo;Lord, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what do<br>
you mean? What, to marry in an inn, and at night too?&rdquo; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; says<br>
the minister, &ldquo;if you will have it be in the church, you shall; but I<br>
assure you your marriage will be as firm here as in the church; we are<br>
not tied by the canons to marry nowhere but in the church; and if you<br>
will have it in the church, it will be a public as a county fair; and<br>
as for the time of day, it does not at all weigh in this case; our<br>
princes are married in their chambers, and at eight or ten o&rsquo;clock at<br>
night.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was a great while before I could be persuaded, and pretended not to<br>
be willing at all to be married but in the church. But it was all<br>
grimace; so I seemed at last to be prevailed on, and my landlord and<br>
his wife and daughter were called up. My landlord was father and clerk<br>
and all together, and we were married, and very merry we were; though I<br>
confess the self-reproaches which I had upon me before lay close to me,<br>
and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me, which my<br>
bridegroom took notice of, and endeavoured to encourage me, thinking,<br>
poor man, that I had some little hesitations at the step I had taken so<br>
hastily.<br>
<br>
We enjoyed ourselves that evening completely, and yet all was kept so<br>
private in the inn that not a servant in the house knew of it, for my<br>
landlady and her daughter waited on me, and would not let any of the<br>
maids come upstairs, except while we were at supper. My landlady&rsquo;s<br>
daughter I called my bridesmaid; and sending for a shopkeeper the next<br>
morning, I gave the young woman a good suit of knots, as good as the<br>
town would afford, and finding it was a lace-making town, I gave her<br>
mother a piece of bone-lace for a head.<br>
<br>
One reason that my landlord was so close was, that he was unwilling the<br>
minister of the parish should hear of it; but for all that somebody<br>
heard of it, so at that we had the bells set a-ringing the next morning<br>
early, and the music, such as the town would afford, under our window;<br>
but my landlord brazened it out, that we were married before we came<br>
thither, only that, being his former guests, we would have our<br>
wedding-supper at his house.<br>
<br>
We could not find in our hearts to stir the next day; for, in short,<br>
having been disturbed by the bells in the morning, and having perhaps<br>
not slept overmuch before, we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in<br>
bed till almost twelve o&rsquo;clock.<br>
<br>
I begged my landlady that we might not have any more music in the town,<br>
nor ringing of bells, and she managed it so well that we were very<br>
quiet; but an odd passage interrupted all my mirth for a good while.<br>
The great room of the house looked into the street, and my new spouse<br>
being belowstairs, I had walked to the end of the room; and it being a<br>
pleasant, warm day, I had opened the window, and was standing at it for<br>
some air, when I saw three gentlemen come by on horseback and go into<br>
an inn just against us.<br>
<br>
It was not to be concealed, nor was it so doubtful as to leave me any<br>
room to question it, but the second of the three was my Lancashire<br>
husband. I was frightened to death; I never was in such a consternation<br>
in my life; I though I should have sunk into the ground; my blood ran<br>
chill in my veins, and I trembled as if I had been in a cold fit of<br>
ague. I say, there was no room to question the truth of it; I knew his<br>
clothes, I knew his horse, and I knew his face.<br>
<br>
The first sensible reflect I made was, that my husband was not by to<br>
see my disorder, and that I was very glad of it. The gentlemen had not<br>
been long in the house but they came to the window of their room, as is<br>
usual; but my window was shut, you may be sure. However, I could not<br>
keep from peeping at them, and there I saw him again, heard him call<br>
out to one of the servants of the house for something he wanted, and<br>
received all the terrifying confirmations of its being the same person<br>
that were possible to be had.<br>
<br>
My next concern was to know, if possible, what was his business there;<br>
but that was impossible. Sometimes my imagination formed an idea of one<br>
frightful thing, sometimes of another; sometimes I thought he had<br>
discovered me, and was come to upbraid me with ingratitude and breach<br>
of honour; and every moment I fancied he was coming up the stairs to<br>
insult me; and innumerable fancies came into my head of what was never<br>
in his head, nor ever could be, unless the devil had revealed it to<br>
him.<br>
<br>
I remained in this fright nearly two hours, and scarce ever kept my eye<br>
from the window or door of the inn where they were. At last, hearing a<br>
great clatter in the passage of their inn, I ran to the window, and, to<br>
my great satisfaction, saw them all three go out again and travel on<br>
westward. Had they gone towards London, I should have been still in a<br>
fright, lest I should meet him on the road again, and that he should<br>
know me; but he went the contrary way, and so I was eased of that<br>
disorder.<br>
<br>
We resolved to be going the next day, but about six o&rsquo;clock at night we<br>
were alarmed with a great uproar in the street, and people riding as if<br>
they had been out of their wits; and what was it but a hue-and-cry<br>
after three highwaymen that had robbed two coaches and some other<br>
travellers near Dunstable Hill, and notice had, it seems, been given<br>
that they had been seen at Brickhill at such a house, meaning the house<br>
where those gentlemen had been.<br>
<br>
The house was immediately beset and searched, but there were witnesses<br>
enough that the gentlemen had been gone over three hours. The crowd<br>
having gathered about, we had the news presently; and I was heartily<br>
concerned now another way. I presently told the people of the house,<br>
that I durst to say those were not the persons, for that I knew one of<br>
the gentlemen to be a very honest person, and of a good estate in<br>
Lancashire.<br>
<br>
The constable who came with the hue-and-cry was immediately informed of<br>
this, and came over to me to be satisfied from my own mouth, and I<br>
assured him that I saw the three gentlemen as I was at the window; that<br>
I saw them afterwards at the windows of the room they dined in; that I<br>
saw them afterwards take horse, and I could assure him I knew one of<br>
them to be such a man, that he was a gentleman of a very good estate,<br>
and an undoubted character in Lancashire, from whence I was just now<br>
upon my journey.<br>
<br>
The assurance with which I delivered this gave the mob gentry a check,<br>
and gave the constable such satisfaction, that he immediately sounded a<br>
retreat, told his people these were not the men, but that he had an<br>
account they were very honest gentlemen; and so they went all back<br>
again. What the truth of the matter was I knew not, but certain it was<br>
that the coaches were robbed at Dunstable Hill, and &pound;560 in money<br>
taken; besides, some of the lace merchants that always travel that way<br>
had been visited too. As to the three gentlemen, that remains to be<br>
explained hereafter.<br>
<br>
Well, this alarm stopped us another day, though my spouse was for<br>
travelling, and told me that it was always safest travelling after a<br>
robbery, for that the thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when<br>
they had alarmed the country; but I was afraid and uneasy, and indeed<br>
principally lest my old acquaintance should be upon the road still, and<br>
should chance to see me.<br>
<br>
I never lived four pleasanter days together in my life. I was a mere<br>
bride all this while, and my new spouse strove to make me entirely easy<br>
in everything. Oh could this state of life have continued, how had all<br>
my past troubles been forgot, and my future sorrows avoided! But I had<br>
a past life of a most wretched kind to account for, some of it in this<br>
world as well as in another.<br>
<br>
We came away the fifth day; and my landlord, because he saw me uneasy,<br>
mounted himself, his son, and three honest country fellows with good<br>
firearms, and, without telling us of it, followed the coach, and would<br>
see us safe into Dunstable. We could do no less than treat them very<br>
handsomely at Dunstable, which cost my spouse about ten or twelve<br>
shillings, and something he gave the men for their time too, but my<br>
landlord would take nothing for himself.<br>
<br>
This was the most happy contrivance for me that could have fallen out;<br>
for had I come to London unmarried, I must either have come to him for<br>
the first night&rsquo;s entertainment, or have discovered to him that I had<br>
not one acquaintance in the whole city of London that could receive a<br>
poor bride for the first night&rsquo;s lodging with her spouse. But now,<br>
being an old married woman, I made no scruple of going directly home<br>
with him, and there I took possession at once of a house well<br>
furnished, and a husband in very good circumstances, so that I had a<br>
prospect of a very happy life, if I knew how to manage it; and I had<br>
leisure to consider of the real value of the life I was likely to live.<br>
How different it was to be from the loose ungoverned part I had acted<br>
before, and how much happier a life of virtue and sobriety is, than<br>
that which we call a life of pleasure.<br>
<br>
Oh had this particular scene of life lasted, or had I learned from that<br>
time I enjoyed it, to have tasted the true sweetness of it, and had I<br>
not fallen into that poverty which is the sure bane of virtue, how<br>
happy had I been, not only here, but perhaps for ever! for while I<br>
lived thus, I was really a penitent for all my life past. I looked back<br>
on it with abhorrence, and might truly be said to hate myself for it. I<br>
often reflected how my lover at the Bath, struck at the hand of God,<br>
repented and abandoned me, and refused to see me any more, though he<br>
loved me to an extreme; but I, prompted by that worst of devils,<br>
poverty, returned to the vile practice, and made the advantage of what<br>
they call a handsome face to be the relief to my necessities, and<br>
beauty be a pimp to vice.<br>
<br>
Now I seemed landed in a safe harbour, after the stormy voyage of life<br>
past was at an end, and I began to be thankful for my deliverance. I<br>
sat many an hour by myself, and wept over the remembrance of past<br>
follies, and the dreadful extravagances of a wicked life, and sometimes<br>
I flattered myself that I had sincerely repented.<br>
<br>
But there are temptations which it is not in the power of human nature<br>
to resist, and few know what would be their case if driven to the same<br>
exigencies. As covetousness is the root of all evil, so poverty is, I<br>
believe, the worst of all snares. But I waive that discourse till I<br>
come to an experiment.<br>
<br>
I lived with this husband with the utmost tranquillity; he was a quiet,<br>
sensible, sober man; virtuous, modest, sincere, and in his business<br>
diligent and just. His business was in a narrow compass, and his income<br>
sufficient to a plentiful way of living in the ordinary way. I do not<br>
say to keep an equipage, and make a figure, as the world calls it, nor<br>
did I expect it, or desire it; for as I abhorred the levity and<br>
extravagance of my former life, so I chose now to live retired, frugal,<br>
and within ourselves. I kept no company, made no visits; minded my<br>
family, and obliged my husband; and this kind of life became a pleasure<br>
to me.<br>
<br>
We lived in an uninterrupted course of ease and content for five years,<br>
when a sudden blow from an almost invisible hand blasted all my<br>
happiness, and turned me out into the world in a condition the reverse<br>
of all that had been before it.<br>
<br>
My husband having trusted one of his fellow-clerks with a sum of money,<br>
too much for our fortunes to bear the loss of, the clerk failed, and<br>
the loss fell very heavy on my husband, yet it was not so great neither<br>
but that, if he had had spirit and courage to have looked his<br>
misfortunes in the face, his credit was so good that, as I told him, he<br>
would easily recover it; for to sink under trouble is to double the<br>
weight, and he that will die in it, shall die in it.<br>
<br>
It was in vain to speak comfortably to him; the wound had sunk too<br>
deep; it was a stab that touched the vitals; he grew melancholy and<br>
disconsolate, and from thence lethargic, and died. I foresaw the blow,<br>
and was extremely oppressed in my mind, for I saw evidently that if he<br>
died I was undone.<br>
<br>
I had had two children by him and no more, for, to tell the truth, it<br>
began to be time for me to leave bearing children, for I was now<br>
eight-and-forty, and I suppose if he had lived I should have had no<br>
more.<br>
<br>
I was now left in a dismal and disconsolate case indeed, and in several<br>
things worse than ever. First, it was past the flourishing time with me<br>
when I might expect to be courted for a mistress; that agreeable part<br>
had declined some time, and the ruins only appeared of what had been;<br>
and that which was worse than all this, that I was the most dejected,<br>
disconsolate creature alive. I that had encouraged my husband, and<br>
endeavoured to support his spirits under his trouble, could not support<br>
my own; I wanted that spirit in trouble which I told him was so<br>
necessary to him for bearing the burthen.<br>
<br>
But my case was indeed deplorable, for I was left perfectly friendless<br>
and helpless, and the loss my husband had sustained had reduced his<br>
circumstances so low, that though indeed I was not in debt, yet I could<br>
easily foresee that what was left would not support me long; that while<br>
it wasted daily for subsistence, I had not way to increase it one<br>
shilling, so that it would be soon all spent, and then I saw nothing<br>
before me but the utmost distress; and this represented itself so<br>
lively to my thoughts, that it seemed as if it was come, before it was<br>
really very near; also my very apprehensions doubled the misery, for I<br>
fancied every sixpence that I paid for a loaf of bread was the last<br>
that I had in the world, and that to-morrow I was to fast, and be<br>
starved to death.<br>
<br>
In this distress I had no assistant, no friend to comfort or advise me;<br>
I sat and cried and tormented myself night and day, wringing my hands,<br>
and sometimes raving like a distracted woman; and indeed I have often<br>
wondered it had not affected my reason, for I had the vapours to such a<br>
degree, that my understanding was sometimes quite lost in fancies and<br>
imaginations.<br>
<br>
I lived two years in this dismal condition, wasting that little I had,<br>
weeping continually over my dismal circumstances, and, as it were, only<br>
bleeding to death, without the least hope or prospect of help from God<br>
or man; and now I had cried too long, and so often, that tears were, as<br>
I might say, exhausted, and I began to be desperate, for I grew poor<br>
apace.<br>
<br>
For a little relief I had put off my house and took lodgings; and as I<br>
was reducing my living, so I sold off most of my goods, which put a<br>
little money in my pocket, and I lived near a year upon that, spending<br>
very sparingly, and eking things out to the utmost; but still when I<br>
looked before me, my very heart would sink within me at the inevitable<br>
approach of misery and want. Oh let none read this part without<br>
seriously reflecting on the circumstances of a desolate state, and how<br>
they would grapple with mere want of friends and want of bread; it will<br>
certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only, but of<br>
looking up to heaven for support, and of the wise man&rsquo;s prayer, &ldquo;Give<br>
me not poverty, lest I steal.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Let them remember that a time of distress is a time of dreadful<br>
temptation, and all the strength to resist is taken away; poverty<br>
presses, the soul is made desperate by distress, and what can be done?<br>
It was one evening, when being brought, as I may say, to the last gasp,<br>
I think I may truly say I was distracted and raving, when prompted by I<br>
know not what spirit, and, as it were, doing I did not know what or<br>
why, I dressed me (for I had still pretty good clothes) and went out. I<br>
am very sure I had no manner of design in my head when I went out; I<br>
neither knew nor considered where to go, or on what business; but as<br>
the devil carried me out and laid his bait for me, so he brought me, to<br>
be sure, to the place, for I knew not whither I was going or what I<br>
did.<br>
<br>
Wandering thus about, I knew not whither, I passed by an apothecary&rsquo;s<br>
shop in Leadenhall Street, when I saw lie on a stool just before the<br>
counter a little bundle wrapped in a white cloth; beyond it stood a<br>
maid-servant with her back to it, looking towards the top of the shop,<br>
where the apothecary&rsquo;s apprentice, as I suppose, was standing upon the<br>
counter, with his back also to the door, and a candle in his hand,<br>
looking and reaching up to the upper shelf for something he wanted, so<br>
that both were engaged mighty earnestly, and nobody else in the shop.<br>
<br>
This was the bait; and the devil, who I said laid the snare, as readily<br>
prompted me as if he had spoke, for I remember, and shall never forget<br>
it, &rsquo;twas like a voice spoken to me over my shoulder, &ldquo;Take the bundle;<br>
be quick; do it this moment.&rdquo; It was no sooner said but I stepped into<br>
the shop, and with my back to the wench, as if I had stood up for a<br>
cart that was going by, I put my hand behind me and took the bundle,<br>
and went off with it, the maid or the fellow not perceiving me, or any<br>
one else.<br>
<br>
It is impossible to express the horror of my soul all the while I did<br>
it. When I went away I had no heart to run, or scarce to mend my pace.<br>
I crossed the street indeed, and went down the first turning I came to,<br>
and I think it was a street that went through into Fenchurch Street.<br>
From thence I crossed and turned through so many ways and turnings,<br>
that I could never tell which way it was, not where I went; for I felt<br>
not the ground I stepped on, and the farther I was out of danger, the<br>
faster I went, till, tired and out of breath, I was forced to sit down<br>
on a little bench at a door, and then I began to recover, and found I<br>
was got into Thames Street, near Billingsgate. I rested me a little and<br>
went on; my blood was all in a fire; my heart beat as if I was in a<br>
sudden fright. In short, I was under such a surprise that I still knew<br>
not wither I was going, or what to do.<br>
<br>
After I had tired myself thus with walking a long way about, and so<br>
eagerly, I began to consider and make home to my lodging, where I came<br>
about nine o&rsquo;clock at night.<br>
<br>
When the bundle was made up for, or on what occasion laid where I found<br>
it, I knew not, but when I came to open it I found there was a suit of<br>
childbed-linen in it, very good and almost new, the lace very fine;<br>
there was a silver porringer of a pint, a small silver mug and six<br>
spoons, with some other linen, a good smock, and three silk<br>
handkerchiefs, and in the mug, wrapped up in a paper, 18s. 6d. in<br>
money.<br>
<br>
All the while I was opening these things I was under such dreadful<br>
impressions of fear, and I such terror of mind, though I was perfectly<br>
safe, that I cannot express the manner of it. I sat me down, and cried<br>
most vehemently. &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what am I now? a thief! Why, I shall<br>
be taken next time, and be carried to Newgate and be tried for my<br>
life!&rdquo; And with that I cried again a long time, and I am sure, as poor<br>
as I was, if I had durst for fear, I would certainly have carried the<br>
things back again; but that went off after a while. Well, I went to bed<br>
for that night, but slept little; the horror of the fact was upon my<br>
mind, and I knew not what I said or did all night, and all the next<br>
day. Then I was impatient to hear some news of the loss; and would fain<br>
know how it was, whether they were a poor body&rsquo;s goods, or a rich.<br>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it may be some poor widow like me, that had packed<br>
up these goods to go and sell them for a little bread for herself and a<br>
poor child, and are now starving and breaking their hearts for want of<br>
that little they would have fetched.&rdquo; And this thought tormented me<br>
worse than all the rest, for three or four days&rsquo; time.<br>
<br>
But my own distresses silenced all these reflections, and the prospect<br>
of my own starving, which grew every day more frightful to me, hardened<br>
my heart by degrees. It was then particularly heavy upon my mind, that<br>
I had been reformed, and had, as I hoped, repented of all my past<br>
wickedness; that I had lived a sober, grave, retired life for several<br>
years, but now I should be driven by the dreadful necessity of my<br>
circumstances to the gates of destruction, soul and body; and two or<br>
three times I fell upon my knees, praying to God, as well as I could,<br>
for deliverance; but I cannot but say, my prayers had no hope in them.<br>
I knew not what to do; it was all fear without, and dark within; and I<br>
reflected on my past life as not sincerely repented of, that Heaven was<br>
now beginning to punish me on this side of the grave, and would make me<br>
as miserable as I had been wicked.<br>
<br>
Had I gone on here I had perhaps been a true penitent; but I had an<br>
evil counsellor within, and he was continually prompting me to relieve<br>
myself by the worst means; so one evening he tempted me again, by the<br>
same wicked impulse that had said &ldquo;Take that bundle,&rdquo; to go out again<br>
and seek for what might happen.<br>
<br>
I went out now by daylight, and wandered about I knew not whither, and<br>
in search of I knew not what, when the devil put a snare in my way of a<br>
dreadful nature indeed, and such a one as I have never had before or<br>
since. Going through Aldersgate Street, there was a pretty little child<br>
who had been at a dancing-school, and was going home, all alone; and my<br>
prompter, like a true devil, set me upon this innocent creature. I<br>
talked to it, and it prattled to me again, and I took it by the hand<br>
and led it along till I came to a paved alley that goes into<br>
Bartholomew Close, and I led it in there. The child said that was not<br>
its way home. I said, &ldquo;Yes, my dear, it is; I&rsquo;ll show you the way<br>
home.&rdquo; The child had a little necklace on of gold beads, and I had my<br>
eye upon that, and in the dark of the alley I stooped, pretending to<br>
mend the child&rsquo;s clog that was loose, and took off her necklace, and<br>
the child never felt it, and so led the child on again. Here, I say,<br>
the devil put me upon killing the child in the dark alley, that it<br>
might not cry, but the very thought frighted me so that I was ready to<br>
drop down; but I turned the child about and bade it go back again, for<br>
that was not its way home. The child said, so she would, and I went<br>
through into Bartholomew Close, and then turned round to another<br>
passage that goes into St. John Street; then, crossing into Smithfield,<br>
went down Chick Lane and into Field Lane to Holborn Bridge, when,<br>
mixing with the crowd of people usually passing there, it was not<br>
possible to have been found out; and thus I enterprised my second sally<br>
into the world.<br>
<br>
The thoughts of this booty put out all the thoughts of the first, and<br>
the reflections I had made wore quickly off; poverty, as I have said,<br>
hardened my heart, and my own necessities made me regardless of<br>
anything. The last affair left no great concern upon me, for as I did<br>
the poor child no harm, I only said to myself, I had given the parents<br>
a just reproof for their negligence in leaving the poor little lamb to<br>
come home by itself, and it would teach them to take more care of it<br>
another time.<br>
<br>
This string of beads was worth about twelve or fourteen pounds. I<br>
suppose it might have been formerly the mother&rsquo;s, for it was too big<br>
for the child&rsquo;s wear, but that perhaps the vanity of the mother, to<br>
have her child look fine at the dancing-school, had made her let the<br>
child wear it; and no doubt the child had a maid sent to take care of<br>
it, but she, careless jade, was taken up perhaps with some fellow that<br>
had met her by the way, and so the poor baby wandered till it fell into<br>
my hands.<br>
<br>
However, I did the child no harm; I did not so much as fright it, for I<br>
had a great many tender thoughts about me yet, and did nothing but<br>
what, as I may say, mere necessity drove me to.<br>
<br>
I had a great many adventures after this, but I was young in the<br>
business, and did not know how to manage, otherwise than as the devil<br>
put things into my head; and indeed he was seldom backward to me. One<br>
adventure I had which was very lucky to me. I was going through Lombard<br>
Street in the dusk of the evening, just by the end of Three King court,<br>
when on a sudden comes a fellow running by me as swift as lightning,<br>
and throws a bundle that was in his hand, just behind me, as I stood up<br>
against the corner of the house at the turning into the alley. Just as<br>
he threw it in he said, &ldquo;God bless you, mistress, let it lie there a<br>
little,&rdquo; and away he runs swift as the wind. After him comes two more,<br>
and immediately a young fellow without his hat, crying &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;<br>
and after him two or three more. They pursued the two last fellows so<br>
close, that they were forced to drop what they had got, and one of them<br>
was taken into the bargain, and other got off free.<br>
<br>
I stood stock-still all this while, till they came back, dragging the<br>
poor fellow they had taken, and lugging the things they had found,<br>
extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the booty and taken<br>
the thief; and thus they passed by me, for I looked only like one who<br>
stood up while the crowd was gone.<br>
<br>
Once or twice I asked what was the matter, but the people neglected<br>
answering me, and I was not very importunate; but after the crowd was<br>
wholly past, I took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was<br>
behind me and walk away. This, indeed, I did with less disturbance than<br>
I had done formerly, for these things I did not steal, but they were<br>
stolen to my hand. I got safe to my lodgings with this cargo, which was<br>
a piece of fine black lustring silk, and a piece of velvet; the latter<br>
was but part of a piece of about eleven yards; the former was a whole<br>
piece of near fifty yards. It seems it was a mercer&rsquo;s shop that they<br>
had rifled. I say rifled, because the goods were so considerable that<br>
they had lost; for the goods that they recovered were pretty many, and<br>
I believe came to about six or seven several pieces of silk. How they<br>
came to get so many I could not tell; but as I had only robbed the<br>
thief, I made no scruple at taking these goods, and being very glad of<br>
them too.<br>
<br>
I had pretty good luck thus far, and I made several adventures more,<br>
though with but small purchase, yet with good success, but I went in<br>
daily dread that some mischief would befall me, and that I should<br>
certainly come to be hanged at last. The impression this made on me was<br>
too strong to be slighted, and it kept me from making attempts that,<br>
for ought I knew, might have been very safely performed; but one thing<br>
I cannot omit, which was a bait to me many a day. I walked frequently<br>
out into the villages round the town, to see if nothing would fall in<br>
my way there; and going by a house near Stepney, I saw on the<br>
window-board two rings, one a small diamond ring, and the other a gold<br>
ring, to be sure laid there by some thoughtless lady, that had more<br>
money than forecast, perhaps only till she washed her hands.<br>
<br>
I walked several times by the window to observe if I could see whether<br>
there was anybody in the room or no, and I could see nobody, but still<br>
I was not sure. It came presently into my thoughts to rap at the glass,<br>
as if I wanted to speak with somebody, and if anybody was there they<br>
would be sure to come to the window, and then I would tell them to<br>
remove those rings, for that I had seen two suspicious fellows take<br>
notice of them. This was a ready thought. I rapped once or twice and<br>
nobody came, when, seeing the coast clear, I thrust hard against the<br>
square of the glass, and broke it with very little noise, and took out<br>
the two rings, and walked away with them very safe. The diamond ring<br>
was worth about &pound;3, and the other about 9s.<br>
<br>
I was now at a loss for a market for my goods, and especially for my<br>
two pieces of silk. I was very loth to dispose of them for a trifle, as<br>
the poor unhappy thieves in general do, who, after they have ventured<br>
their lives for perhaps a thing of value, are fain to sell it for a<br>
song when they have done; but I was resolved I would not do thus,<br>
whatever shift I made, unless I was driven to the last extremity.<br>
However, I did not well know what course to take. At last I resolved to<br>
go to my old governess, and acquaint myself with her again. I had<br>
punctually supplied the &pound;5 a year to her for my little boy as long as I<br>
was able, but at last was obliged to put a stop to it. However, I had<br>
written a letter to her, wherein I had told her that my circumstances<br>
were reduced very low; that I had lost my husband, and that I was not<br>
able to do it any longer, and so begged that the poor child might not<br>
suffer too much for its mother&rsquo;s misfortunes.<br>
<br>
I now made her a visit, and I found that she drove something of the old<br>
trade still, but that she was not in such flourishing circumstances as<br>
before; for she had been sued by a certain gentleman who had had his<br>
daughter stolen from him, and who, it seems, she had helped to convey<br>
away; and it was very narrowly that she escaped the gallows. The<br>
expense also had ravaged her, and she was become very poor; her house<br>
was but meanly furnished, and she was not in such repute for her<br>
practice as before; however, she stood upon her legs, as they say, and<br>
as she was a stirring, bustling woman, and had some stock left, she was<br>
turned pawnbroker, and lived pretty well.<br>
<br>
She received me very civilly, and with her usual obliging manner told<br>
me she would not have the less respect for me for my being reduced;<br>
that she had taken care my boy was very well looked after, though I<br>
could not pay for him, and that the woman that had him was easy, so<br>
that I needed not to trouble myself about him till I might be better<br>
able to do it effectually.<br>
<br>
I told her that I had not much money left, but that I had some things<br>
that were money&rsquo;s worth, if she could tell me how I might turn them<br>
into money. She asked me what it was I had. I pulled out the string of<br>
gold beads, and told her it was one of my husband&rsquo;s presents to me;<br>
then I showed her the two parcels of silk, which I told her I had from<br>
Ireland, and brought up to town with me; and the little diamond ring.<br>
As to the small parcel of plate and spoons, I had found means to<br>
dispose of them myself before; and as for the childbed-linen I had, she<br>
offered me to take it herself, believing it to have been my own. She<br>
told me that she was turned pawnbroker, and that she would sell those<br>
things for me as pawn to her; and so she sent presently for proper<br>
agents that bought them, being in her hands, without any scruple, and<br>
gave good prices too.<br>
<br>
I now began to think this necessary woman might help me a little in my<br>
low condition to some business, for I would gladly have turned my hand<br>
to any honest employment if I could have got it. But here she was<br>
deficient; honest business did not come within her reach. If I had been<br>
younger, perhaps she might have helped me to a spark, but my thoughts<br>
were off that kind of livelihood, as being quite out of the way after<br>
fifty, which was my case, and so I told her.<br>
<br>
She invited me at last to come, and be at her house till I could find<br>
something to do, and it should cost me very little, and this I gladly<br>
accepted of. And now living a little easier, I entered into some<br>
measures to have my little son by my last husband taken off; and this<br>
she made easy too, reserving a payment only of &pound;5 a year, if I could<br>
pay it. This was such a help to me, that for a good while I left off<br>
the wicked trade that I had so newly taken up; and gladly I would have<br>
got my bread by the help of my needle if I could have got work, but<br>
that was very hard to do for one that had no manner of acquaintance in<br>
the world.<br>
<br>
However, at last I got some quilting work for ladies&rsquo; beds, petticoats,<br>
and the like; and this I liked very well, and worked very hard, and<br>
with this I began to live; but the diligent devil, who resolved I<br>
should continue in his service, continually prompted me to go out and<br>
take a walk, that is to say, to see if anything would offer in the old<br>
way.<br>
<br>
One evening I blindly obeyed his summons, and fetched a long circuit<br>
through the streets, but met with no purchase, and came home very weary<br>
and empty; but not content with that, I went out the next evening too,<br>
when going by an alehouse I saw the door of a little room open, next<br>
the very street, and on the table a silver tankard, things much in use<br>
in public-houses at that time. It seems some company had been drinking<br>
there, and the careless boys had forgot to take it away.<br>
<br>
I went into the box frankly, and setting the silver tankard on the<br>
corner of the bench, I sat down before it, and knocked with my foot; a<br>
boy came presently, and I bade him fetch me a pint of warm ale, for it<br>
was cold weather; the boy ran, and I heard him go down the cellar to<br>
draw the ale. While the boy was gone, another boy came into the room,<br>
and cried, &ldquo;D&rsquo; ye call?&rdquo; I spoke with a melancholy air, and said, &ldquo;No,<br>
child; the boy is gone for a pint of ale for me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
While I sat here, I heard the woman in the bar say, &ldquo;Are they all gone<br>
in the five?&rdquo; which was the box I sat in, and the boy said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who<br>
fetched the tankard away?&rdquo; says the woman. &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; says another boy;<br>
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; pointing, it seems, to another tankard, which he had<br>
fetched from another box by mistake; or else it must be, that the rogue<br>
forgot that he had not brought it in, which certainly he had not.<br>
<br>
I heard all this, much to my satisfaction, for I found plainly that the<br>
tankard was not missed, and yet they concluded it was fetched away; so<br>
I drank my ale, called to pay, and as I went away I said, &ldquo;Take care of<br>
your plate, child,&rdquo; meaning a silver pint mug, which he brought me<br>
drink in. The boy said, &ldquo;Yes, madam, very welcome,&rdquo; and away I came.<br>
<br>
I came home to my governess, and now I thought it was a time to try<br>
her, that if I might be put to the necessity of being exposed, she<br>
might offer me some assistance. When I had been at home some time, and<br>
had an opportunity of talking to her, I told her I had a secret of the<br>
greatest consequence in the world to commit to her, if she had respect<br>
enough for me to keep it a secret. She told me she had kept one of my<br>
secrets faithfully; why should I doubt her keeping another? I told her<br>
the strangest thing in the world had befallen me, and that it had made<br>
a thief of me, even without any design, and so told her the whole story<br>
of the tankard. &ldquo;And have you brought it away with you, my dear?&rdquo; says<br>
she. &ldquo;To be sure I have,&rdquo; says I, and showed it her. &ldquo;But what shall I<br>
do now,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;must not carry it again?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Carry it again!&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Ay, if you are minded to be sent to<br>
Newgate for stealing it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t be so base to stop<br>
me, when I carry it to them again?&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know those sort of<br>
people, child,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll not only carry you to Newgate, but<br>
hang you too, without any regard to the honesty of returning it; or<br>
bring in an account of all the other tankards they have lost, for you<br>
to pay for.&rdquo; &ldquo;What must I do, then?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;as you<br>
have played the cunning part and stole it, you must e&rsquo;en keep it;<br>
there&rsquo;s no going back now. Besides, child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you want<br>
it more than they do? I wish you could light of such a bargain once a<br>
week.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This gave me a new notion of my governess, and that since she was<br>
turned pawnbroker, she had a sort of people about her that were none of<br>
the honest ones that I had met with there before.<br>
<br>
I had not been long there but I discovered it more plainly than before,<br>
for every now and then I saw hilts of swords, spoons, forks, tankards,<br>
and all such kind of ware brought in, not to be pawned, but to be sold<br>
downright; and she bought everything that came without asking any<br>
questions, but had very good bargains, as I found by her discourse.<br>
<br>
I found also that in following this trade she always melted down the<br>
plate she bought, that it might not be challenged; and she came to me<br>
and told me one morning that she was going to melt, and if I would, she<br>
would put my tankard in, that it might not be seen by anybody. I told<br>
her, with all my heart; so she weighed it, and allowed me the full<br>
value in silver again; but I found she did not do the same to the rest<br>
of her customers.<br>
<br>
Some time after this, as I was at work, and very melancholy, she begins<br>
to ask me what the matter was, as she was used to do. I told her my<br>
heart was heavy; I had little work, and nothing to live on, and knew<br>
not what course to take. She laughed, and told me I must go out again<br>
and try my fortune; it might be that I might meet with another piece of<br>
plate. &ldquo;O mother!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that is a trade I have no skill in, and if<br>
I should be taken I am undone at once.&rdquo; Says she, &ldquo;I could help you to<br>
a schoolmistress that shall make you as dexterous as herself.&rdquo; I<br>
trembled at that proposal, for hitherto I had had no confederates, nor<br>
any acquaintance among that tribe. But she conquered all my modesty,<br>
and all my fears; and in a little time, by the help of this<br>
confederate, I grew as impudent a thief, and as dexterous as ever Moll<br>
Cutpurse was, though, if fame does not belie her, not half so handsome.<br>
<br>
The comrade she helped me to dealt in three sorts of craft, viz.<br>
shoplifting, stealing of shop-books and pocket-books, and taking off<br>
gold watches from the ladies&rsquo; sides; and this last she did so<br>
dexterously that no woman ever arrived to the performance of that art<br>
so as to do it like her. I liked the first and the last of these things<br>
very well, and I attended her some time in the practice, just as a<br>
deputy attends a midwife, without any pay.<br>
<br>
At length she put me to practice. She had shown me her art, and I had<br>
several times unhooked a watch from her own side with great dexterity.<br>
At last she showed me a prize, and this was a young lady big with<br>
child, who had a charming watch. The thing was to be done as she came<br>
out of church. She goes on one side of the lady, and pretends, just as<br>
she came to the steps, to fall, and fell against the lady with so much<br>
violence as put her into a great fright, and both cried out terribly.<br>
In the very moment that she jostled the lady, I had hold of the watch,<br>
and holding it the right way, the start she gave drew the hook out, and<br>
she never felt it. I made off immediately, and left my schoolmistress<br>
to come out of her pretended fright gradually, and the lady too; and<br>
presently the watch was missed. &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says my comrade, &ldquo;then it was<br>
those rogues that thrust me down, I warrant ye; I wonder the<br>
gentlewoman did not miss her watch before, then we might have taken<br>
them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She humoured the thing so well that nobody suspected her, and I was got<br>
home a full hour before her. This was my first adventure in company.<br>
The watch was indeed a very fine one, and had a great many trinkets<br>
about it, and my governess allowed us &pound;20 for it, of which I had half.<br>
And thus I was entered a complete thief, hardened to the pitch above<br>
all the reflections of conscience or modesty, and to a degree which I<br>
must acknowledge I never thought possible in me.<br>
<br>
Thus the devil, who began, by the help of an irresistible poverty, to<br>
push me into this wickedness, brought me on to a height beyond the<br>
common rate, even when my necessities were not so great, or the<br>
prospect of my misery so terrifying; for I had now got into a little<br>
vein of work, and as I was not at a loss to handle my needle, it was<br>
very probable, as acquaintance came in, I might have got my bread<br>
honestly enough.<br>
<br>
I must say, that if such a prospect of work had presented itself at<br>
first, when I began to feel the approach of my miserable<br>
circumstances&mdash;I say, had such a prospect of getting my bread by working<br>
presented itself then, I had never fallen into this wicked trade, or<br>
into such a wicked gang as I was now embarked with; but practice had<br>
hardened me, and I grew audacious to the last degree; and the more so<br>
because I had carried it on so long, and had never been taken; for, in<br>
a word, my new partner in wickedness and I went on together so long,<br>
without being ever detected, that we not only grew bold, but we grew<br>
rich, and we had at one time one-and-twenty gold watches in our hands.<br>
<br>
I remember that one day being a little more serious than ordinary, and<br>
finding I had so good a stock beforehand as I had, for I had near &pound;200<br>
in money for my share, it came strongly into my mind, no doubt from<br>
some kind spirit, if such there be, that at first poverty excited me,<br>
and my distresses drove me to these dreadful shifts; so seeing those<br>
distresses were now relieved, and I could also get something towards a<br>
maintenance by working, and had so good a bank to support me, why<br>
should I now not leave off, as they say, while I was well? that I could<br>
not expect to go always free; and if I was once surprised, and<br>
miscarried, I was undone.<br>
<br>
This was doubtless the happy minute, when, if I had hearkened to the<br>
blessed hint, from whatsoever had it came, I had still a cast for an<br>
easy life. But my fate was otherwise determined; the busy devil that so<br>
industriously drew me in had too fast hold of me to let me go back; but<br>
as poverty brought me into the mire, so avarice kept me in, till there<br>
was no going back. As to the arguments which my reason dictated for<br>
persuading me to lay down, avarice stepped in and said, &ldquo;Go on, go on;<br>
you have had very good luck; go on till you have gotten four or five<br>
hundred pounds, and then you shall leave off, and then you may live<br>
easy without working at all.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Thus I, that was once in the devil&rsquo;s clutches, was held fast there as<br>
with a charm, and had no power to go without the circle, till I was<br>
engulfed in labyrinths of trouble too great to get out at all.<br>
<br>
However, these thoughts left some impression upon me, and made me act<br>
with some more caution than before, and more than my directors used for<br>
themselves. My comrade, as I called her, but rather she should have<br>
been called my teacher, with another of her scholars, was the first in<br>
the misfortune; for, happening to be upon the hunt for purchase, they<br>
made an attempt upon a linen-draper in Cheapside, but were snapped by a<br>
hawk&rsquo;s-eyed journeyman, and seized with two pieces of cambric, which<br>
were taken also upon them.<br>
<br>
This was enough to lodge them both in Newgate, where they had the<br>
misfortune to have some of their former sins brought to remembrance.<br>
Two other indictments being brought against them, and the facts being<br>
proved upon them, they were both condemned to die. They both pleaded<br>
their bellies, and were both voted quick with child; though my tutoress<br>
was no more with child than I was.<br>
<br>
I went frequently to see them, and condole with them, expecting that it<br>
would be my turn next; but the place gave me so much horror, reflecting<br>
that it was the place of my unhappy birth, and of my mother&rsquo;s<br>
misfortunes, and that I could not bear it, so I was forced to leave off<br>
going to see them.<br>
<br>
And oh! could I have but taken warning by their disasters, I had been<br>
happy still, for I was yet free, and had nothing brought against me;<br>
but it could not be, my measure was not yet filled up.<br>
<br>
My comrade, having the brand of an old offender, was executed; the<br>
young offender was spared, having obtained a reprieve, but lay starving<br>
a long while in prison, till at last she got her name into what they<br>
call a circuit pardon, and so came off.<br>
<br>
This terrible example of my comrade frighted me heartily, and for a<br>
good while I made no excursions; but one night, in the neighbourhood of<br>
my governess&rsquo;s house, they cried &ldquo;Fire.&rdquo; My governess looked out, for<br>
we were all up, and cried immediately that such a gentlewoman&rsquo;s house<br>
was all of a light fire atop, and so indeed it was. Here she gives me a<br>
job. &ldquo;Now, child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;there is a rare opportunity, for the fire<br>
being so near that you may go to it before the street is blocked up<br>
with the crowd.&rdquo; She presently gave me my cue. &ldquo;Go, child,&rdquo; says she,<br>
&ldquo;to the house, and run in and tell the lady, or anybody you see, that<br>
you come to help them, and that you came from such a gentlewoman (that<br>
is, one of her acquaintance farther up the street).&rdquo; She gave me the<br>
like cue to the next house, naming another name that was also an<br>
acquaintance of the gentlewoman of the house.<br>
<br>
Away I went, and, coming to the house, I found them all in confusion,<br>
you may be sure. I ran in, and finding one of the maids, &ldquo;Lord!<br>
sweetheart,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;how came this dismal accident? Where is your<br>
mistress? Any how does she do? Is she safe? And where are the children?<br>
I come from Madam &mdash;&mdash; to help you.&rdquo; Away runs the maid. &ldquo;Madam, madam,&rdquo;<br>
says she, screaming as loud as she could yell, &ldquo;here is a gentlewoman<br>
come from Madam &mdash;&mdash; to help us.&rdquo; The poor woman, half out of her wits,<br>
with a bundle under her arm, an two little children, comes toward me.<br>
&ldquo;Lord! madam,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;let me carry the poor children to Madam &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo;<br>
she desires you to send them; she&rsquo;ll take care of the poor lambs;&rsquo; and<br>
immediately I takes one of them out of her hand, and she lifts the<br>
other up into my arms. &ldquo;Ay, do, for God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;carry them<br>
to her. Oh! thank her for her kindness.&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you anything else to<br>
secure, madam?&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;she will take care of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh dear! ay,&rdquo; says<br>
she, &ldquo;God bless her, and thank her. Take this bundle of plate and carry<br>
it to her too. Oh, she is a good woman. Oh Lord! we are utterly ruined,<br>
utterly undone!&rdquo; And away she runs from me out of her wits, and the<br>
maids after her; and away comes I with the two children and the bundle.<br>
<br>
I was no sooner got into the street but I saw another woman come to me.<br>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;mistress,&rdquo; in a piteous tone, &ldquo;you will let fall the<br>
child. Come, this is a sad time; let me help you&rdquo;; and immediately lays<br>
hold of my bundle to carry it for me. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;if you will help<br>
me, take the child by the hand, and lead it for me but to the upper end<br>
of the street; I&rsquo;ll go with you and satisfy you for your pains.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She could not avoid going, after what I said; but the creature, in<br>
short, was one of the same business with me, and wanted nothing but the<br>
bundle; however, she went with me to the door, for she could not help<br>
it. When we were come there I whispered her, &ldquo;Go, child,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I<br>
understand your trade; you may meet with purchase enough.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She understood me and walked off. I thundered at the door with the<br>
children, and as the people were raised before by the noise of the<br>
fire, I was soon let in, and I said, &ldquo;Is madam awake? Pray tell her<br>
Mrs. &mdash;&mdash; desires the favour of her to take the two children in; poor<br>
lady, she will be undone, their house is all of a flame,&rdquo; They took the<br>
children in very civilly, pitied the family in distress, and away came<br>
I with my bundle. One of the maids asked me if I was not to leave the<br>
bundle too. I said, &ldquo;No, sweetheart, &rsquo;tis to go to another place; it<br>
does not belong to them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I was a great way out of the hurry now, and so I went on, clear of<br>
anybody&rsquo;s inquiry, and brought the bundle of plate, which was very<br>
considerable, straight home, and gave it to my old governess. She told<br>
me she would not look into it, but bade me go out again to look for<br>
more.<br>
<br>
She gave me the like cue to the gentlewoman of the next house to that<br>
which was on fire, and I did my endeavour to go, but by this time the<br>
alarm of fire was so great, and so many engines playing, and the street<br>
so thronged with people, that I could not get near the house whatever I<br>
would do; so I came back again to my governess&rsquo;s, and taking the bundle<br>
up into my chamber, I began to examine it. It is with horror that I<br>
tell what a treasure I found there; &rsquo;tis enough to say, that besides<br>
most of the family plate, which was considerable, I found a gold chain,<br>
an old-fashioned thing, the locket of which was broken, so that I<br>
suppose it had not been used some years, but the gold was not the worse<br>
for that; also a little box of burying-rings, the lady&rsquo;s wedding-ring,<br>
and some broken bits of old lockets of gold, a gold watch, and a purse<br>
with about &pound;24 value in old pieces of gold coin, and several other<br>
things of value.<br>
<br>
This was the greatest and the worst prize that ever I was concerned in;<br>
for indeed, though, as I have said above, I was hardened now beyond the<br>
power of all reflection in other cases, yet it really touched me to the<br>
very soul when I looked into this treasure, to think of the poor<br>
disconsolate gentlewoman who had lost so much by the fire besides; and<br>
who would think, to be sure, that she had saved her plate and best<br>
things; how she would be surprised and afflicted when she should find<br>
that she had been deceived, and should find that the person that took<br>
her children and her goods, had not come, as was pretended, from the<br>
gentlewoman in the next street, but that the children had been put upon<br>
her without her own knowledge.<br>
<br>
I say, I confess the inhumanity of this action moved me very much, and<br>
made me relent exceedingly, and tears stood in my eyes upon that<br>
subject; but with all my sense of its being cruel and inhuman, I could<br>
never find in my heart to make any restitution. The reflection wore<br>
off, and I began quickly to forget the circumstances that attended the<br>
taking them.<br>
<br>
Nor was this all; for though by this job I was become considerably<br>
richer than before, yet the resolution I had formerly taken, of leaving<br>
off this horrid trade when I had gotten a little more, did not return,<br>
but I must still get farther, and more; and the avarice joined so with<br>
the success, that I had no more thought of coming to a timely<br>
alteration of life, though without it I could expect no safety, no<br>
tranquillity in the possession of what I had so wickedly gained; but a<br>
little more, and a little more, was the case still.<br>
<br>
At length, yielding to the importunities of my crime, I cast off all<br>
remorse and repentance, and all the reflections on that head turned to<br>
no more than this, that I might perhaps come to have one booty more<br>
that might complete my desires; but though I certainly had that one<br>
booty, yet every hit looked towards another, and was so encouraging to<br>
me to go on with the trade, that I had no gust to the thought of laying<br>
it down.<br>
<br>
In this condition, hardened by success, and resolving to go on, I fell<br>
into the snare in which I was appointed to meet with my last reward for<br>
this kind of life. But even this was not yet, for I met with several<br>
successful adventures more in this way of being undone.<br>
<br>
I remained still with my governess, who was for a while really<br>
concerned for the misfortune of my comrade that had been hanged, and<br>
who, it seems, knew enough of my governess to have sent her the same<br>
way, and which made her very uneasy; indeed, she was in a very great<br>
fright.<br>
<br>
It is true that when she was gone, and had not opened mouth to tell<br>
what she knew, my governess was easy as to that point, and perhaps glad<br>
she was hanged, for it was in her power to have obtained a pardon at<br>
the expense of her friends; but on the other hand, the loss of her, and<br>
the sense of her kindness in not making her market of what she knew,<br>
moved my governess to mourn very sincerely for her. I comforted her as<br>
well as I could, and she in return hardened me to merit more completely<br>
the same fate.<br>
<br>
However, as I have said, it made me the more wary, and particularly I<br>
was very shy of shoplifting, especially among the mercers and drapers,<br>
who are a set of fellows that have their eyes very much about them. I<br>
made a venture or two among the lace folks and the milliners, and<br>
particularly at one shop where I got notice of two young women who were<br>
newly set up, and had not been bred to the trade. There I think I<br>
carried off a piece of bone-lace, worth six or seven pounds, and a<br>
paper of thread. But this was but once; it was a trick that would not<br>
serve again.<br>
<br>
It was always reckoned a safe job when we heard of a new shop, and<br>
especially when the people were such as were not bred to shops. Such<br>
may depend upon it that they will be visited once or twice at their<br>
beginning, and they must be very sharp indeed if they can prevent it.<br>
<br>
I made another adventure or two, but they were but trifles too, though<br>
sufficient to live on. After this nothing considerable offering for a<br>
good while, I began to think that I must give over the trade in<br>
earnest; but my governess, who was not willing to lose me, and expected<br>
great things of me, brought me one day into company with a young woman<br>
and a fellow that went for her husband, though as it appeared<br>
afterwards, she was not his wife, but they were partners, it seems, in<br>
the trade they carried on, and partners in something else. In short,<br>
they robbed together, lay together, were taken together, and at last<br>
were hanged together.<br>
<br>
I came into a kind of league with these two by the help of my<br>
governess, and they carried me out into three or four adventures, where<br>
I rather saw them commit some coarse and unhandy robberies, in which<br>
nothing but a great stock of impudence on their side, and gross<br>
negligence on the people&rsquo;s side who were robbed, could have made them<br>
successful. So I resolved from that time forward to be very cautious<br>
how I adventured upon anything with them; and indeed, when two or three<br>
unlucky projects were proposed by them, I declined the offer, and<br>
persuaded them against it. One time they particularly proposed robbing<br>
a watchmaker of three gold watches, which they had eyed in the daytime,<br>
and found the place where he laid them. One of them had so many keys of<br>
all kinds, that he made no question to open the place where the<br>
watchmaker had laid them; and so we made a kind of an appointment; but<br>
when I came to look narrowly into the thing, I found they proposed<br>
breaking open the house, and this, as a thing out of my way, I would<br>
not embark in, so they went without me. They did get into the house by<br>
main force, and broke up the locked place where the watches were, but<br>
found but one of the gold watches, and a silver one, which they took,<br>
and got out of the house again very clear. But the family, being<br>
alarmed, cried out &ldquo;Thieves,&rdquo; and the man was pursued and taken; the<br>
young woman had got off too, but unhappily was stopped at a distance,<br>
and the watches found upon her. And thus I had a second escape, for<br>
they were convicted, and both hanged, being old offenders, though but<br>
young people. As I said before that they robbed together and lay<br>
together, so now they hanged together, and there ended my new<br>
partnership.<br>
<br>
I began now to be very wary, having so narrowly escaped a scouring, and<br>
having such an example before me; but I had a new tempter, who prompted<br>
me every day&mdash;I mean my governess; and now a prize presented, which as<br>
it came by her management, so she expected a good share of the booty.<br>
There was a good quantity of Flanders lace lodged in a private house,<br>
where she had gotten intelligence of it, and Flanders lace being<br>
prohibited, it was a good booty to any custom-house officer that could<br>
come at it. I had a full account from my governess, as well of the<br>
quantity as of the very place where it was concealed, and I went to a<br>
custom-house officer, and told him I had such a discovery to make to<br>
him of such a quantity of lace, if he would assure me that I should<br>
have my due share of the reward. This was so just an offer, that<br>
nothing could be fairer; so he agreed, and taking a constable and me<br>
with him, we beset the house. As I told him I could go directly to the<br>
place, he left it to me; and the hole being very dark, I squeezed<br>
myself into it, with a candle in my hand, and so reached the pieces out<br>
to him, taking care as I gave him some so to secure as much about<br>
myself as I could conveniently dispose of. There was near &pound;300 worth of<br>
lace in the hole, and I secured about &pound;50 worth of it to myself. The<br>
people of the house were not owners of the lace, but a merchant who had<br>
entrusted them with it; so that they were not so surprised as I thought<br>
they would be.<br>
<br>
I left the officer overjoyed with his prize, and fully satisfied with<br>
what he had got, and appointed to meet him at a house of his own<br>
directing, where I came after I had disposed of the cargo I had about<br>
me, of which he had not the least suspicion. When I came to him he<br>
began to capitulate with me, believing I did not understand the right I<br>
had to a share in the prize, and would fain have put me off with &pound;20,<br>
but I let him know that I was not so ignorant as he supposed I was; and<br>
yet I was glad, too, that he offered to bring me to a certainty.<br>
<br>
I asked &pound;100, and he rose up to &pound;30; I fell to &pound;80, and he rose again<br>
to &pound;40; in a word, he offered &pound;50, and I consented, only demanding a<br>
piece of lace, which I thought came to about &pound;8 or &pound;9, as if it had<br>
been for my own wear, and he agreed to it. So I got &pound;50 in money paid<br>
me that same night, and made an end of the bargain; nor did he ever<br>
know who I was, or where to inquire for me, so that if it had been<br>
discovered that part of the goods were embezzled, he could have made no<br>
challenge upon me for it.<br>
<br>
I very punctually divided this spoil with my governess, and I passed<br>
with her from this time for a very dexterous manager in the nicest<br>
cases. I found that this last was the best and easiest sort of work<br>
that was in my way, and I made it my business to inquire out prohibited<br>
goods, and after buying some, usually betrayed them, but none of these<br>
discoveries amounted to anything considerable, not like that I related<br>
just now; but I was willing to act safe, and was still cautious of<br>
running the great risks which I found others did, and in which they<br>
miscarried every day.<br>
<br>
The next thing of moment was an attempt at a gentlewoman&rsquo;s good watch.<br>
It happened in a crowd, at a meeting-house, where I was in very great<br>
danger of being taken. I had full hold of her watch, but giving a great<br>
jostle, as if somebody had thrust me against her, and in the juncture<br>
giving the watch a fair pull, I found it would not come, so I let it go<br>
that moment, and cried out as if I had been killed, that somebody had<br>
trod upon my foot, and that there were certainly pickpockets there, for<br>
somebody or other had given a pull at my watch; for you are to observe<br>
that on these adventures we always went very well dressed, and I had<br>
very good clothes on, and a gold watch by my side, as like a lady as<br>
other fold.<br>
<br>
I had no sooner said so, but the other gentlewoman cried out &ldquo;A<br>
pickpocket&rdquo; too, for somebody, she said, had tried to pull her watch<br>
away.<br>
<br>
When I touched her watch I was close to her, but when I cried out I<br>
stopped as it were short, and the crowd bearing her forward a little,<br>
she made a noise too, but it was at some distance from me, so that she<br>
did not in the least suspect me; but when she cried out &ldquo;A pickpocket,&rdquo;<br>
somebody cried, &ldquo;Ay, and here has been another! this gentlewoman has<br>
been attempted too.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
At that very instance, a little farther in the crowd, and very luckily<br>
too, they cried out &ldquo;A pickpocket,&rdquo; again, and really seized a young<br>
fellow in the very act. This, though unhappy for the wretch, was very<br>
opportunely for my case, though I had carried it off handsomely enough<br>
before; but now it was out of doubt, and all the loose part of the<br>
crowd ran that way, and the poor boy was delivered up to the rage of<br>
the street, which is a cruelty I need not describe, and which, however,<br>
they are always glad of, rather than to be sent to Newgate, where they<br>
lie often a long time, till they are almost perished, and sometimes<br>
they are hanged, and the best they can look for, if they are convicted,<br>
is to be transported.<br>
<br>
This was a narrow escape to me, and I was so frighted that I ventured<br>
no more at gold watches a great while. There was indeed a great many<br>
concurring circumstances in this adventure which assisted to my escape;<br>
but the chief was, that the woman whose watch I had pulled at was a<br>
fool; that is to say, she was ignorant of the nature of the attempt,<br>
which one would have thought she should not have been, seeing she was<br>
wise enough to fasten her watch so that it could not be slipped up. But<br>
she was in such a fright that she had no thought about her proper for<br>
the discovery; for she, when she felt the pull, screamed out, and<br>
pushed herself forward, and put all the people about her into disorder,<br>
but said not a word of her watch, or of a pickpocket, for at least two<br>
minutes&rsquo; time, which was time enough for me, and to spare. For as I had<br>
cried out behind her, as I have said, and bore myself back in the crowd<br>
as she bore forward, there were several people, at least seven or<br>
eight, the throng being still moving on, that were got between me and<br>
her in that time, and then I crying out &ldquo;A pickpocket,&rdquo; rather sooner<br>
than she, or at least as soon, she might as well be the person<br>
suspected as I, and the people were confused in their inquiry; whereas,<br>
had she with a presence of mind needful on such an occasion, as soon as<br>
she felt the pull, not screamed out as she did, but turned immediately<br>
round and seized the next body that was behind her, she had infallibly<br>
taken me.<br>
<br>
This is a direction not of the kindest sort to the fraternity, but &rsquo;tis<br>
certainly a key to the clue of a pickpocket&rsquo;s motions, and whoever can<br>
follow it will as certainly catch the thief as he will be sure to miss<br>
if he does not.<br>
<br>
I had another adventure, which puts this matter out of doubt, and which<br>
may be an instruction for posterity in the case of a pickpocket. My<br>
good old governess, to give a short touch at her history, though she<br>
had left off the trade, was, as I may say, born a pickpocket, and, as I<br>
understood afterwards, had run through all the several degrees of that<br>
art, and yet had never been taken but once, when she was so grossly<br>
detected, that she was convicted and ordered to be transported; but<br>
being a woman of a rare tongue, and withal having money in her pocket,<br>
she found means, the ship putting into Ireland for provisions, to get<br>
on shore there, where she lived and practised her old trade for some<br>
years; when falling into another sort of bad company, she turned<br>
midwife and procuress, and played a hundred pranks there, which she<br>
gave me a little history of in confidence between us as we grew more<br>
intimate; and it was to this wicked creature that I owed all the art<br>
and dexterity I arrived to, in which there were few that ever went<br>
beyond me, or that practised so long without any misfortune.<br>
<br>
It was after those adventures in Ireland, and when she was pretty well<br>
known in that country, that she left Dublin and came over to England,<br>
where, the time of her transportation being not expired, she left her<br>
former trade, for fear of falling into bad hands again, for then she<br>
was sure to have gone to wreck. Here she set up the same trade she had<br>
followed in Ireland, in which she soon, by her admirable management and<br>
good tongue, arrived to the height which I have already described, and<br>
indeed began to be rich, though her trade fell off again afterwards, as<br>
I have hinted before.<br>
<br>
I mentioned thus much of the history of this woman here, the better to<br>
account for the concern she had in the wicked life I was now leading,<br>
into all the particulars of which she led me, as it were, by the hand,<br>
and gave me such directions, and I so well followed them, that I grew<br>
the greatest artist of my time and worked myself out of every danger<br>
with such dexterity, that when several more of my comrades ran<br>
themselves into Newgate presently, and by that time they had been half<br>
a year at the trade, I had now practised upwards of five years, and the<br>
people at Newgate did not so much as know me; they had heard much of me<br>
indeed, and often expected me there, but I always got off, though many<br>
times in the extremest danger.<br>
<br>
One of the greatest dangers I was now in, was that I was too well known<br>
among the trade, and some of them, whose hatred was owing rather to<br>
envy than any injury I had done them, began to be angry that I should<br>
always escape when they were always catched and hurried to Newgate.<br>
These were they that gave me the name of Moll Flanders; for it was no<br>
more of affinity with my real name or with any of the name I had ever<br>
gone by, than black is of kin to white, except that once, as before, I<br>
called myself Mrs. Flanders; when I sheltered myself in the Mint; but<br>
that these rogues never knew, nor could I ever learn how they came to<br>
give me the name, or what the occasion of it was.<br>
<br>
I was soon informed that some of these who were gotten fast into<br>
Newgate had vowed to impeach me; and as I knew that two or three of<br>
them were but too able to do it, I was under a great concern about it,<br>
and kept within doors for a good while. But my governess&mdash;whom I always<br>
made partner in my success, and who now played a sure game with me, for<br>
that she had a share of the gain and no share in the hazard&mdash;I say, my<br>
governess was something impatient of my leading such a useless,<br>
unprofitable life, as she called it; and she laid a new contrivance for<br>
my going abroad, and this was to dress me up in men&rsquo;s clothes, and so<br>
put me into a new kind of practice.<br>
<br>
I was tall and personable, but a little too smooth-faced for a man;<br>
however, I seldom went abroad but in the night, it did well enough; but<br>
it was a long time before I could behave in my new clothes&mdash;I mean, as<br>
to my craft. It was impossible to be so nimble, so ready, so dexterous<br>
at these things in a dress so contrary to nature; and I did everything<br>
clumsily, so I had neither the success nor the easiness of escape that<br>
I had before, and I resolved to leave it off; but that resolution was<br>
confirmed soon after by the following accident.<br>
<br>
As my governess disguised me like a man, so she joined me with a man, a<br>
young fellow that was nimble enough at his business, and for about<br>
three weeks we did very well together. Our principal trade was watching<br>
shopkeepers&rsquo; counters, and slipping off any kind of goods we could see<br>
carelessly laid anywhere, and we made several good bargains, as we<br>
called them, at this work. And as we kept always together, so we grew<br>
very intimate, yet he never knew that I was not a man, nay, though I<br>
several times went home with him to his lodgings, according as our<br>
business directed, and four or five times lay with him all night. But<br>
our design lay another way, and it was absolutely necessary to me to<br>
conceal my sex from him, as appeared afterwards. The circumstances of<br>
our living, coming in late, and having such and such business to do as<br>
required that nobody should be trusted with the coming into our<br>
lodgings, were such as made it impossible to me to refuse lying with<br>
him, unless I would have owned my sex; and as it was, I effectually<br>
concealed myself. But his ill, and my good fortune, soon put an end to<br>
this life, which I must own I was sick of too, on several other<br>
accounts. We had made several prizes in this new way of business, but<br>
the last would be extraordinary. There was a shop in a certain street<br>
which had a warehouse behind it that looked into another street, the<br>
house making the corner of the turning.<br>
<br>
Through the window of the warehouse we saw, lying on the counter or<br>
showboard, which was just before it, five pieces of silks, besides<br>
other stuffs, and though it was almost dark, yet the people, being busy<br>
in the fore-shop with customers, had not had time to shut up those<br>
windows, or else had forgot it.<br>
<br>
This the young fellow was so overjoyed with, that he could not restrain<br>
himself. It lay all within his reach he said, and he swore violently to<br>
me that he would have it, if he broke down the house for it. I<br>
dissuaded him a little, but saw there was no remedy; so he ran rashly<br>
upon it, slipped out a square of the sash window dexterously enough,<br>
and without noise, and got out four pieces of the silks, and came with<br>
them towards me, but was immediately pursued with a terrible clutter<br>
and noise. We were standing together indeed, but I had not taken any of<br>
the goods out of his hand, when I said to him hastily, &ldquo;You are undone,<br>
fly, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; He ran like lightning, and I too, but the pursuit<br>
was hotter after him because he had the goods, than after me. He<br>
dropped two of the pieces, which stopped them a little, but the crowd<br>
increased and pursued us both. They took him soon after with the other<br>
two pieces upon him, and then the rest followed me. I ran for it and<br>
got into my governess&rsquo;s house whither some quick-eyed people followed<br>
me so warmly as to fix me there. They did not immediately knock, at the<br>
door, by which I got time to throw off my disguise and dress me in my<br>
own clothes; besides, when they came there, my governess, who had her<br>
tale ready, kept her door shut, and called out to them and told them<br>
there was no man come in there. The people affirmed there did a man<br>
come in there, and swore they would break open the door.<br>
<br>
My governess, not at all surprised, spoke calmly to them, told them<br>
they should very freely come and search her house, if they should bring<br>
a constable, and let in none but such as the constable would admit, for<br>
it was unreasonable to let in a whole crowd. This they could not<br>
refuse, though they were a crowd. So a constable was fetched<br>
immediately, and she very freely opened the door; the constable kept<br>
the door, and the men he appointed searched the house, my governess<br>
going with them from room to room. When she came to my room she called<br>
to me, and said aloud, &ldquo;Cousin, pray open the door; here&rsquo;s some<br>
gentlemen that must come and look into your room.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had a little girl with me, which was my governess&rsquo;s grandchild, as<br>
she called her; and I bade her open the door, and there sat I at work<br>
with a great litter of things about me, as if I had been at work all<br>
day, being myself quite undressed, with only night-clothes on my head,<br>
and a loose morning-gown wrapped about me. My governess made a kind of<br>
excuse for their disturbing me, telling me partly the occasion of it,<br>
and that she had no remedy but to open the doors to them, and let them<br>
satisfy themselves, for all she could say to them would not satisfy<br>
them. I sat still, and bid them search the room if they pleased, for if<br>
there was anybody in the house, I was sure they were not in my room;<br>
and as for the rest of the house, I had nothing to say to that, I did<br>
not understand what they looked for.<br>
<br>
Everything looked so innocent and so honest about me, that they treated<br>
me civiller than I expected, but it was not till they had searched the<br>
room to a nicety, even under the bed, in the bed, and everywhere else<br>
where it was possible anything could be hid. When they had done this,<br>
and could find nothing, they asked my pardon for troubling me, and went<br>
down.<br>
<br>
When they had thus searched the house from bottom to top, and then top<br>
to bottom, and could find nothing, they appeased the mob pretty well;<br>
but they carried my governess before the justice. Two men swore that<br>
they saw the man whom they pursued go into her house. My governess<br>
rattled and made a great noise that her house should be insulted, and<br>
that she should be used thus for nothing; that if a man did come in, he<br>
might go out again presently for aught she knew, for she was ready to<br>
make oath that no man had been within her doors all that day as she<br>
knew of (and that was very true indeed); that it might be indeed that<br>
as she was abovestairs, any fellow in a fright might find the door open<br>
and run in for shelter when he was pursued, but that she knew nothing<br>
of it; and if it had been so, he certainly went out again, perhaps at<br>
the other door, for she had another door into an alley, and so had made<br>
his escape and cheated them all.<br>
<br>
This was indeed probable enough, and the justice satisfied himself with<br>
giving her an oath that she had not received or admitted any man into<br>
her house to conceal him, or protect or hide him from justice. This<br>
oath she might justly take, and did so, and so she was dismissed.<br>
<br>
It is easy to judge what a fright I was in upon this occasion, and it<br>
was impossible for my governess ever to bring me to dress in that<br>
disguise again; for, as I told her, I should certainly betray myself.<br>
<br>
My poor partner in this mischief was now in a bad case, for he was<br>
carried away before my Lord Mayor, and by his worship committed to<br>
Newgate, and the people that took him were so willing, as well as able,<br>
to prosecute him, that they offered themselves to enter into<br>
recognisances to appear at the sessions and pursue the charge against<br>
him.<br>
<br>
However, he got his indictment deferred, upon promise to discover his<br>
accomplices, and particularly the man that was concerned with him in<br>
his robbery; and he failed not to do his endeavour, for he gave in my<br>
name, whom he called Gabriel Spencer, which was the name I went by to<br>
him; and here appeared the wisdom of my concealing my name and sex from<br>
him, which, if he had ever known I had been undone.<br>
<br>
He did all he could to discover this Gabriel Spencer; he described me,<br>
he discovered the place where he said I lodged, and, in a word, all the<br>
particulars that he could of my dwelling; but having concealed the main<br>
circumstances of my sex from him, I had a vast advantage, and he never<br>
could hear of me. He brought two or three families into trouble by his<br>
endeavouring to find me out, but they knew nothing of me, any more than<br>
that I had a fellow with me that they had seen, but knew nothing of.<br>
And as for my governess, though she was the means of his coming to me,<br>
yet it was done at second-hand, and he knew nothing of her.<br>
<br>
This turned to his disadvantage; for having promised discoveries, but<br>
not being able to make it good, it was looked upon as trifling with the<br>
justice of the city, and he was the more fiercely pursued by the<br>
shopkeepers who took him.<br>
<br>
I was, however, terribly uneasy all this while, and that I might be<br>
quite out of the way, I went away from my governess&rsquo;s for a while; but<br>
not knowing wither to wander, I took a maid-servant with me, and took<br>
the stage-coach to Dunstable, to my old landlord and landlady, where I<br>
had lived so handsomely with my Lancashire husband. Here I told her a<br>
formal story, that I expected my husband every day from Ireland, and<br>
that I had sent a letter to him that I would meet him at Dunstable at<br>
her house, and that he would certainly land, if the wind was fair, in a<br>
few days, so that I was come to spend a few days with them till he<br>
should come, for he was either come post, or in the West Chester coach,<br>
I knew not which; but whichsoever it was, he would be sure to come to<br>
that house to meet me.<br>
<br>
My landlady was mighty glad to see me, and my landlord made such a stir<br>
with me, that if I had been a princess I could not have been better<br>
used, and here I might have been welcome a month or two if I had<br>
thought fit.<br>
<br>
But my business was of another nature. I was very uneasy (though so<br>
well disguised that it was scarce possible to detect me) lest this<br>
fellow should somehow or other find me out; and though he could not<br>
charge me with this robbery, having persuaded him not to venture, and<br>
having also done nothing in it myself but run away, yet he might have<br>
charged me with other things, and have bought his own life at the<br>
expense of mine.<br>
<br>
This filled me with horrible apprehensions. I had no recourse, no<br>
friend, no confidante but my old governess, and I knew no remedy but to<br>
put my life in her hands, and so I did, for I let her know where to<br>
send to me, and had several letters from her while I stayed here. Some<br>
of them almost scared me out my wits but at last she sent me the joyful<br>
news that he was hanged, which was the best news to me that I had heard<br>
a great while.<br>
<br>
I had stayed here five weeks, and lived very comfortably indeed (the<br>
secret anxiety of my mind excepted); but when I received this letter I<br>
looked pleasantly again, and told my landlady that I had received a<br>
letter from my spouse in Ireland, that I had the good news of his being<br>
very well, but had the bad news that his business would not permit him<br>
to come away so soon as he expected, and so I was like to go back again<br>
without him.<br>
<br>
My landlady complimented me upon the good news however, that I had<br>
heard he was well. &ldquo;For I have observed, madam,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;you hadn&rsquo;t<br>
been so pleasant as you used to be; you have been over head and ears in<br>
care for him, I dare say,&rdquo; says the good woman; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis easy to be seen<br>
there&rsquo;s an alteration in you for the better,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Well, I am<br>
sorry the esquire can&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo; says my landlord; &ldquo;I should have<br>
been heartily glad to have seen him. But I hope, when you have certain<br>
news of his coming, you&rsquo;ll take a step hither again, madam,&rdquo; says he;<br>
&ldquo;you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
With all these fine compliments we parted, and I came merry enough to<br>
London, and found my governess as well pleased as I was. And now she<br>
told me she would never recommend any partner to me again, for she<br>
always found, she said, that I had the best luck when I ventured by<br>
myself. And so indeed I had, for I was seldom in any danger when I was<br>
by myself, or if I was, I got out of it with more dexterity than when I<br>
was entangled with the dull measures of other people, who had perhaps<br>
less forecast, and were more rash and impatient than I; for though I<br>
had as much courage to venture as any of them, yet I used more caution<br>
before I undertook a thing, and had more presence of mind when I was to<br>
bring myself off.<br>
<br>
I have often wondered even at my own hardiness another way, that when<br>
all my companions were surprised and fell so suddenly into the hand of<br>
justice, and that I so narrowly escaped, yet I could not all this while<br>
enter into one serious resolution to leave off this trade, and<br>
especially considering that I was now very far from being poor; that<br>
the temptation of necessity, which is generally the introduction of all<br>
such wickedness, was now removed; for I had near &pound;500 by me in ready<br>
money, on which I might have lived very well, if I had thought fit to<br>
have retired; but I say, I had not so much as the least inclination to<br>
leave off; no, not so much as I had before when I had but &pound;200<br>
beforehand, and when I had no such frightful examples before my eyes as<br>
these were. From hence &rsquo;tis evident to me, that when once we are<br>
hardened in crime, no fear can affect us, no example give us any<br>
warning.<br>
<br>
I had indeed one comrade whose fate went very near me for a good while,<br>
though I wore it off too in time. That case was indeed very unhappy. I<br>
had made a prize of a piece of very good damask in a mercer&rsquo;s shop, and<br>
went clear off myself, but had conveyed the piece to this companion of<br>
mine when we went out of the shop, and she went one way and I went<br>
another. We had not been long out of the shop but the mercer missed his<br>
piece of stuff, and sent his messengers, one one way and one another,<br>
and they presently seized her that had the piece, with the damask upon<br>
her. As for me, I had very luckily stepped into a house where there was<br>
a lace chamber, up one pair of stairs, and had the satisfaction, or the<br>
terror indeed, of looking out of the window upon the noise they made,<br>
and seeing the poor creature dragged away in triumph to the justice,<br>
who immediately committed her to Newgate.<br>
<br>
I was careful to attempt nothing in the lace chamber, but tumbled their<br>
goods pretty much to spend time; then bought a few yards of edging and<br>
paid for it, and came away very sad-hearted indeed for the poor woman,<br>
who was in tribulation for what I only had stolen.<br>
<br>
Here again my old caution stood me in good stead; namely, that though I<br>
often robbed with these people, yet I never let them know who I was, or<br>
where I lodged, nor could they ever find out my lodging, though they<br>
often endeavoured to watch me to it. They all knew me by the name of<br>
Moll Flanders, though even some of them rather believed I was she than<br>
knew me to be so. My name was public among them indeed, but how to find<br>
me out they knew not, nor so much as how to guess at my quarters,<br>
whether they were at the east end of the town or the west; and this<br>
wariness was my safety upon all these occasions.<br>
<br>
I kept close a great while upon the occasion of this woman&rsquo;s disaster.<br>
I knew that if I should do anything that should miscarry, and should be<br>
carried to prison, she would be there and ready to witness against me,<br>
and perhaps save her life at my expense. I considered that I began to<br>
be very well known by name at the Old Bailey, though they did not know<br>
my face, and that if I should fall into their hands, I should be<br>
treated as an old offender; and for this reason I was resolved to see<br>
what this poor creature&rsquo;s fate should be before I stirred abroad,<br>
though several times in her distress I conveyed money to her for her<br>
relief.<br>
<br>
At length she came to her trial. She pleaded she did not steal the<br>
thing, but that one Mrs. Flanders, as she heard her called (for she did<br>
not know her), gave the bundle to her after they came out of the shop,<br>
and bade her carry it home to her lodging. They asked her where this<br>
Mrs. Flanders was, but she could not produce her, neither could she<br>
give the least account of me; and the mercer&rsquo;s men swearing positively<br>
that she was in the shop when the goods were stolen, that they<br>
immediately missed them, and pursued her, and found them upon her,<br>
thereupon the jury brought her in guilty; but the Court, considering<br>
that she was really not the person that stole the goods, an inferior<br>
assistant, and that it was very possible she could not find out this<br>
Mrs. Flanders, meaning me, though it would save her life, which indeed<br>
was true&mdash;I say, considering all this, they allowed her to be<br>
transported, which was the utmost favour she could obtain, only that<br>
the Court told her that if she could in the meantime produce the said<br>
Mrs. Flanders, they would intercede for her pardon; that is to say, if<br>
she could find me out, and hand me, she should not be transported. This<br>
I took care to make impossible to her, and so she was shipped off in<br>
pursuance of her sentence a little while after.<br>
<br>
I must repeat it again, that the fate of this poor woman troubled me<br>
exceedingly, and I began to be very pensive, knowing that I was really<br>
the instrument of her disaster; but the preservation of my own life,<br>
which was so evidently in danger, took off all my tenderness; and<br>
seeing that she was not put to death, I was very easy at her<br>
transportation, because she was then out of the way of doing me any<br>
mischief, whatever should happen.<br>
<br>
The disaster of this woman was some months before that of the<br>
last-recited story, and was indeed partly occasion of my governess<br>
proposing to dress me up in men&rsquo;s clothes, that I might go about<br>
unobserved, as indeed I did; but I was soon tired of that disguise, as<br>
I have said, for indeed it exposed me to too many difficulties.<br>
<br>
I was now easy as to all fear of witnesses against me, for all those<br>
that had either been concerned with me, or that knew me by the name of<br>
Moll Flanders, were either hanged or transported; and if I should have<br>
had the misfortune to be taken, I might call myself anything else, as<br>
well as Moll Flanders, and no old sins could be placed into my account;<br>
so I began to run a-tick again with the more freedom, and several<br>
successful adventures I made, though not such as I had made before.<br>
<br>
We had at that time another fire happened not a great way off from the<br>
place where my governess lived, and I made an attempt there, as before,<br>
but as I was not soon enough before the crowd of people came in, and<br>
could not get to the house I aimed at, instead of a prize, I got a<br>
mischief, which had almost put a period to my life and all my wicked<br>
doings together; for the fire being very furious, and the people in a<br>
great fright in removing their goods, and throwing them out of window,<br>
a wench from out of a window threw a feather-bed just upon me. It is<br>
true, the bed being soft, it broke no bones; but as the weight was<br>
great, and made greater by the fall, it beat me down, and laid me dead<br>
for a while. Nor did the people concern themselves much to deliver me<br>
from it, or to recover me at all; but I lay like one dead and neglected<br>
a good while, till somebody going to remove the bed out of the way,<br>
helped me up. It was indeed a wonder the people in the house had not<br>
thrown other goods out after it, and which might have fallen upon it,<br>
and then I had been inevitably killed; but I was reserved for further<br>
afflictions.<br>
<br>
This accident, however, spoiled my market for that time, and I came<br>
home to my governess very much hurt and bruised, and frighted to the<br>
last degree, and it was a good while before she could set me upon my<br>
feet again.<br>
<br>
It was now a merry time of the year, and Bartholomew Fair was begun. I<br>
had never made any walks that way, nor was the common part of the fair<br>
of much advantage to me; but I took a turn this year into the<br>
cloisters, and among the rest I fell into one of the raffling shops. It<br>
was a thing of no great consequence to me, nor did I expect to make<br>
much of it; but there came a gentleman extremely well dressed and very<br>
rich, and as &rsquo;tis frequent to talk to everybody in those shops, he<br>
singled me out, and was very particular with me. First he told me he<br>
would put in for me to raffle, and did so; and some small matter coming<br>
to his lot, he presented it to me (I think it was a feather muff); then<br>
he continued to keep talking to me with a more than common appearance<br>
of respect, but still very civil, and much like a gentleman.<br>
<br>
He held me in talk so long, till at last he drew me out of the raffling<br>
place to the shop-door, and then to a walk in the cloister, still<br>
talking of a thousand things cursorily without anything to the purpose.<br>
At last he told me that, without compliment, he was charmed with my<br>
company, and asked me if I durst trust myself in a coach with him; he<br>
told me he was a man of honour, and would not offer anything to me<br>
unbecoming him as such. I seemed to decline it a while, but suffered<br>
myself to be importuned a little, and then yielded.<br>
<br>
I was at a loss in my thoughts to conclude at first what this gentleman<br>
designed; but I found afterwards he had had some drink in his head, and<br>
that he was not very unwilling to have some more. He carried me in the<br>
coach to the Spring Garden, at Knightsbridge, where we walked in the<br>
gardens, and he treated me very handsomely; but I found he drank very<br>
freely. He pressed me also to drink, but I declined it.<br>
<br>
Hitherto he kept his word with me, and offered me nothing amiss. We<br>
came away in the coach again, and he brought me into the streets, and<br>
by this time it was near ten o&rsquo;clock at night, and he stopped the coach<br>
at a house where, it seems, he was acquainted, and where they made no<br>
scruple to show us upstairs into a room with a bed in it. At first I<br>
seemed to be unwilling to go up, but after a few words I yielded to<br>
that too, being willing to see the end of it, and in hope to make<br>
something of it at last. As for the bed, etc., I was not much concerned<br>
about that part.<br>
<br>
Here he began to be a little freer with me than he had promised; and I<br>
by little and little yielded to everything, so that, in a word, he did<br>
what he pleased with me; I need say no more. All this while he drank<br>
freely too, and about one in the morning we went into the coach again.<br>
The air and the shaking of the coach made the drink he had get more up<br>
in his head than it was before, and he grew uneasy in the coach, and<br>
was for acting over again what he had been doing before; but as I<br>
thought my game now secure, I resisted him, and brought him to be a<br>
little still, which had not lasted five minutes but he fell fast<br>
asleep.<br>
<br>
I took this opportunity to search him to a nicety. I took a gold watch,<br>
with a silk purse of gold, his fine full-bottom periwig and<br>
silver-fringed gloves, his sword and fine snuff-box, and gently opening<br>
the coach door, stood ready to jump out while the coach was going on;<br>
but the coach stopped in the narrow street beyond Temple Bar to let<br>
another coach pass, I got softly out, fastened the door again, and gave<br>
my gentleman and the coach the slip both together, and never heard more<br>
of them.<br>
<br>
This was an adventure indeed unlooked for, and perfectly undesigned by<br>
me; though I was not so past the merry part of life, as to forget how<br>
to behave, when a fop so blinded by his appetite should not know an old<br>
woman from a young. I did not indeed look so old as I was by ten or<br>
twelve years; yet I was not a young wench of seventeen, and it was easy<br>
enough to be distinguished. There is nothing so absurd, so surfeiting,<br>
so ridiculous, as a man heated by wine in his head, and wicked gust in<br>
his inclination together; he is in the possession of two devils at<br>
once, and can no more govern himself by his reason than a mill can<br>
grind without water; his vice tramples upon all that was in him that<br>
had any good in it, if any such thing there was; nay, his very sense is<br>
blinded by its own rage, and he acts absurdities even in his views;<br>
such a drinking more, when he is drunk already; picking up a common<br>
woman, without regard to what she is or who she is, whether sound or<br>
rotten, clean or unclean, whether ugly or handsome, whether old or<br>
young, and so blinded as not really to distinguish. Such a man is worse<br>
than a lunatic; prompted by his vicious, corrupted head, he no more<br>
knows what he is doing than this wretch of mine knew when I picked his<br>
pocket of his watch and his purse of gold.<br>
<br>
These are the men of whom Solomon says, &ldquo;They go like an ox to the<br>
slaughter, till a dart strikes through their liver&rdquo;; an admirable<br>
description, by the way, of the foul disease, which is a poisonous<br>
deadly contagion mingling with the blood, whose centre or foundation is<br>
in the liver; from whence, by the swift circulation of the whole mass,<br>
that dreadful nauseous plague strikes immediately through his liver,<br>
and his spirits are infected, his vitals stabbed through as with a<br>
dart.<br>
<br>
It is true this poor unguarded wretch was in no danger from me, though<br>
I was greatly apprehensive at first of what danger I might be in from<br>
him; but he was really to be pitied in one respect, that he seemed to<br>
be a good sort of man in himself; a gentleman that had no harm in his<br>
design; a man of sense, and of a fine behaviour, a comely handsome<br>
person, a sober solid countenance, a charming beautiful face, and<br>
everything that could be agreeable; only had unhappily had some drink<br>
the night before, had not been in bed, as he told me when we were<br>
together; was hot, and his blood fired with wine, and in that condition<br>
his reason, as it were asleep, had given him up.<br>
<br>
As for me, my business was his money, and what I could make of him; and<br>
after that, if I could have found out any way to have done it, I would<br>
have sent him safe home to his house and to his family, for &rsquo;twas ten<br>
to one but he had an honest, virtuous wife and innocent children, that<br>
were anxious for his safety, and would have been glad to have gotten<br>
him home, and have taken care of him till he was restored to himself.<br>
And then with what shame and regret would he look back upon himself!<br>
how would he reproach himself with associating himself with a whore!<br>
picked up in the worst of all holes, the cloister, among the dirt and<br>
filth of all the town! how would he be trembling for fear he had got<br>
the pox, for fear a dart had struck through his liver, and hate himself<br>
every time he looked back upon the madness and brutality of his<br>
debauch! how would he, if he had any principles of honour, as I verily<br>
believe he had&mdash;I say, how would he abhor the thought of giving any ill<br>
distemper, if he had it, as for aught he knew he might, to his modest<br>
and virtuous wife, and thereby sowing the contagion in the life-blood<br>
of his posterity.<br>
<br>
Would such gentlemen but consider the contemptible thoughts which the<br>
very women they are concerned with, in such cases as these, have of<br>
them, it would be a surfeit to them. As I said above, they value not<br>
the pleasure, they are raised by no inclination to the man, the passive<br>
jade thinks of no pleasure but the money; and when he is, as it were,<br>
drunk in the ecstasies of his wicked pleasure, her hands are in his<br>
pockets searching for what she can find there, and of which he can no<br>
more be sensible in the moment of his folly that he can forethink of it<br>
when he goes about it.<br>
<br>
I knew a woman that was so dexterous with a fellow, who indeed deserved<br>
no better usage, that while he was busy with her another way, conveyed<br>
his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fob-pocket, where he had<br>
put it for fear of her, and put another purse with gilded counters in<br>
it into the room of it. After he had done, he says to her, &ldquo;Now han&rsquo;t<br>
you picked my pocket?&rdquo; She jested with him, and told him she supposed<br>
he had not much to lose; he put his hand to his fob, and with his<br>
fingers felt that his purse was there, which fully satisfied him, and<br>
so she brought off his money. And this was a trade with her; she kept a<br>
sham gold watch, that is, a watch of silver gilt, and a purse of<br>
counters in her pocket to be ready on all such occasions, and I doubt<br>
not practiced it with success.<br>
<br>
I came home with this last booty to my governess, and really when I<br>
told her the story, it so affected her that she was hardly able to<br>
forbear tears, to know how such a gentleman ran a daily risk of being<br>
undone every time a glass of wine got into his head.<br>
<br>
But as to the purchase I got, and how entirely I stripped him, she told<br>
me it pleased her wonderfully. &ldquo;Nay child,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;the usage may,<br>
for aught I know, do more to reform him than all the sermons that ever<br>
he will hear in his life.&rdquo; And if the remainder of the story be true,<br>
so it did.<br>
<br>
I found the next day she was wonderful inquisitive about this<br>
gentleman; the description I had given her of him, his dress, his<br>
person, his face, everything concurred to make her think of a gentleman<br>
whose character she knew, and family too. She mused a while, and I<br>
going still on with the particulars, she starts up; says she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay<br>
&pound;100 I know the gentleman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I am sorry you do,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for I would not have him exposed on any<br>
account in the world; he has had injury enough already by me, and I<br>
would not be instrumental to do him any more.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I<br>
will do him no injury, I assure you, but you may let me satisfy my<br>
curiosity a little, for if it is he, I warrant you I find it out.&rdquo; I<br>
was a little startled at that, and told her, with an apparent concern<br>
in my face, that by the same rule he might find me out, and then I was<br>
undone. She returned warmly, &ldquo;Why, do you think I will betray you,<br>
child? No, no,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;not for all he is worth in the world. I have<br>
kept your counsel in worse things than these; sure you may trust me in<br>
this.&rdquo; So I said no more at that time.<br>
<br>
She laid her scheme another way, and without acquainting me of it, but<br>
she was resolved to find it out if possible. So she goes to a certain<br>
friend of hers who was acquainted in the family that she guessed at,<br>
and told her friend she had some extraordinary business with such a<br>
gentleman (who, by the way, was no less than a baronet, and of a very<br>
good family), and that she knew not how to come at him without somebody<br>
to introduce her. Her friend promised her very readily to do it, and<br>
accordingly goes to the house to see if the gentleman was in town.<br>
<br>
The next day she come to my governess and tells her that Sir &mdash;&mdash; was at<br>
home, but that he had met with a disaster and was very ill, and there<br>
was no speaking with him. &ldquo;What disaster?&rdquo; says my governess hastily,<br>
as if she was surprised at it. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says her friend, &ldquo;he had been at<br>
Hampstead to visit a gentleman of his acquaintance, and as he came back<br>
again he was set upon and robbed; and having got a little drink too, as<br>
they suppose, the rogues abused him, and he is very ill.&rdquo; &ldquo;Robbed!&rdquo;<br>
says my governess, &ldquo;and what did they take from him?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says her<br>
friend, &ldquo;they took his gold watch and his gold snuff-box, his fine<br>
periwig, and what money he had in his pocket, which was considerable,<br>
to be sure, for Sir &mdash;&mdash; never goes without a purse of guineas about<br>
him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; says my old governess, jeering, &ldquo;I warrant you he has got<br>
drunk now and got a whore, and she has picked his pocket, and so he<br>
comes home to his wife and tells her he has been robbed. That&rsquo;s an old<br>
sham; a thousand such tricks are put upon the poor women every day.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; says her friend, &ldquo;I find you don&rsquo;t know Sir &mdash;&mdash;; why he is as<br>
civil a gentleman, there is not a finer man, nor a soberer, graver,<br>
modester person in the whole city; he abhors such things; there&rsquo;s<br>
nobody that knows him will think such a thing of him.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo;<br>
says my governess, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s none of my business; if it was, I warrant I<br>
should find there was something of that kind in it; your modest men in<br>
common opinion are sometimes no better than other people, only they<br>
keep a better character, or, if you please, are the better hypocrites.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says her friend, &ldquo;I can assure you Sir &mdash;&mdash; is no hypocrite, he<br>
is really an honest, sober gentleman, and he has certainly been<br>
robbed.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says my governess, &ldquo;it may be he has; it is no business<br>
of mine, I tell you; I only want to speak with him; my business is of<br>
another nature.&rdquo; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says her friend, &ldquo;let your business be of what<br>
nature it will, you cannot see him yet, for he is not fit to be seen,<br>
for he is very ill, and bruised very much.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says my governess,<br>
&ldquo;nay, then he has fallen into bad hands, to be sure.&rdquo; And then she<br>
asked gravely, &ldquo;Pray, where is he bruised?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, in the head,&rdquo; says<br>
her friend, &ldquo;and one of his hands, and his face, for they used him<br>
barbarously.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor gentleman,&rdquo; says my governess, &ldquo;I must wait, then,<br>
till he recovers&rdquo;; and adds, &ldquo;I hope it will not be long, for I want<br>
very much to speak with him.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Away she comes to me and tells me this story. &ldquo;I have found out your<br>
fine gentleman, and a fine gentleman he was,&rdquo; says she; &ldquo;but, mercy on<br>
him, he is in a sad pickle now. I wonder what the d&mdash;l you have done to<br>
him; why, you have almost killed him.&rdquo; I looked at her with disorder<br>
enough. &ldquo;I killed him!&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;you must mistake the person; I am sure<br>
I did nothing to him; he was very well when I left him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only<br>
drunk and fast asleep.&rdquo; &ldquo;I know nothing of that,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but he is<br>
in a sad pickle now&rdquo;; and so she told me all that her friend had said<br>
to her. &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;he fell into bad hands after I left him,<br>
for I am sure I left him safe enough.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
About ten days after, or a little more, my governess goes again to her<br>
friend, to introduce her to this gentleman; she had inquired other ways<br>
in the meantime, and found that he was about again, if not abroad<br>
again, so she got leave to speak with him.<br>
<br>
She was a woman of a admirable address, and wanted nobody to introduce<br>
her; she told her tale much better than I shall be able to tell it for<br>
her, for she was a mistress of her tongue, as I have said already. She<br>
told him that she came, though a stranger, with a single design of<br>
doing him a service and he should find she had no other end in it; that<br>
as she came purely on so friendly an account, she begged promise from<br>
him, that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose he<br>
would not take it ill that she meddled with what was not her business.<br>
She assured him that as what she had to say was a secret that belonged<br>
to him only, so whether he accepted her offer or not, it should remain<br>
a secret to all the world, unless he exposed it himself; nor should his<br>
refusing her service in it make her so little show her respect as to do<br>
him the least injury, so that he should be entirely at liberty to act<br>
as he thought fit.<br>
<br>
He looked very shy at first, and said he knew nothing that related to<br>
him that required much secrecy; that he had never done any man any<br>
wrong, and cared not what anybody might say of him; that it was no part<br>
of his character to be unjust to anybody, nor could he imagine in what<br>
any man could render him any service; but that if it was so<br>
disinterested a service as she said, he could not take it ill from any<br>
one that they should endeavour to serve him; and so, as it were, left<br>
her a liberty either to tell him or not to tell, as she thought fit.<br>
<br>
She found him so perfectly indifferent, that she was almost afraid to<br>
enter into the point with him; but, however, after some other<br>
circumlocutions she told him that by a strange and unaccountable<br>
accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy<br>
adventure he had fallen into, and that in such a manner, that there was<br>
nobody in the world but herself and him that were acquainted with it,<br>
no, not the very person that was with him.<br>
<br>
He looked a little angrily at first. &ldquo;What adventure?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;<br>
said she, &ldquo;of your being robbed coming from Knightbr&mdash;&mdash;; Hampstead, sir,<br>
I should say,&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Be not surprised, sir,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;that I am<br>
able to tell you every step you took that day from the cloister in<br>
Smithfield to the Spring Garden at Knightsbridge, and thence to the &mdash;&mdash;<br>
in the Strand, and how you were left asleep in the coach afterwards. I<br>
say, let not this surprise you, for, sir, I do not come to make a booty<br>
of you, I ask nothing of you, and I assure you the woman that was with<br>
you knows nothing who you are, and never shall; and yet perhaps I may<br>
serve you further still, for I did not come barely to let you know that<br>
I was informed of these things, as if I wanted a bribe to conceal them;<br>
assure yourself, sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that whatever you think fit to do or<br>
say to me, it shall be all a secret as it is, as much as if I were in<br>
my grave.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
He was astonished at her discourse, and said gravely to her, &ldquo;Madam,<br>
you are a stranger to me, but it is very unfortunate that you should be<br>
let into the secret of the worst action of my life, and a thing that I<br>
am so justly ashamed of, that the only satisfaction of it to me was,<br>
that I thought it was known only to God and my own conscience.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pray,<br>
sir,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;do not reckon the discovery of it to me to be any part<br>
of your misfortune. It was a thing, I believe, you were surprised into,<br>
and perhaps the woman used some art to prompt you to it; however, you<br>
will never find any just cause,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to repent that I came to<br>
hear of it; nor can your own mouth be more silent in it that I have<br>
been, and ever shall be.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;but let me do some justice to the woman too; whoever<br>
she is, I do assure you she prompted me to nothing, she rather declined<br>
me. It was my own folly and madness that brought me into it all, ay,<br>
and brought her into it too; I must give her her due so far. As to what<br>
she took from me, I could expect no less from her in the condition I<br>
was in, and to this hour I know not whether she robbed me or the<br>
coachman; if she did it, I forgive her, and I think all gentlemen that<br>
do so should be used in the same manner; but I am more concerned for<br>
some other things that I am for all that she took from me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
My governess now began to come into the whole matter, and he opened<br>
himself freely to her. First she said to him, in answer to what he had<br>
said about me, &ldquo;I am glad, sir, you are so just to the person that you<br>
were with; I assure you she is a gentlewoman, and no woman of the town;<br>
and however you prevailed with her so far as you did, I am sure &rsquo;tis<br>
not her practice. You ran a great venture indeed, sir; but if that be<br>
any part of your care, I am persuaded you may be perfectly easy, for I<br>
dare assure you no man has touched her, before you, since her husband,<br>
and he has been dead now almost eight years.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It appeared that this was his grievance, and that he was in a very<br>
great fright about it; however, when my governess said this to him, he<br>
appeared very well pleased, and said, &ldquo;Well, madam, to be plain with<br>
you, if I was satisfied of that, I should not so much value what I<br>
lost; for, as to that, the temptation was great, and perhaps she was<br>
poor and wanted it.&rdquo; &ldquo;If she had not been poor, sir &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; says my<br>
governess, &ldquo;I assure you she would never have yielded to you; and as<br>
her poverty first prevailed with her to let you do as you did, so the<br>
same poverty prevailed with her to pay herself at last, when she saw<br>
you were in such a condition, that if she had not done it, perhaps the<br>
next coachman might have done it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;much good may it do her. I say again, all the<br>
gentlemen that do so ought to be used in the same manner, and then they<br>
would be cautious of themselves. I have no more concern about it, but<br>
on the score which you hinted at before, madam.&rdquo; Here he entered into<br>
some freedoms with her on the subject of what passed between us, which<br>
are not so proper for a woman to write, and the great terror that was<br>
upon his mind with relation to his wife, for fear he should have<br>
received any injury from me, and should communicate it farther; and<br>
asked her at last if she could not procure him an opportunity to speak<br>
with me. My governess gave him further assurances of my being a woman<br>
clear from any such thing, and that he was as entirely safe in that<br>
respect as he was with his own lady; but as for seeing me, she said it<br>
might be of dangerous consequence; but, however, that she would talk<br>
with me, and let him know my answer, using at the same time some<br>
arguments to persuade him not to desire it, and that it could be of no<br>
service to him, seeing she hoped he had no desire to renew a<br>
correspondence with me, and that on my account it was a kind of putting<br>
my life in his hands.<br>
<br>
He told her he had a great desire to see me, that he would give her any<br>
assurances that were in his power, not to take any advantages of me,<br>
and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all<br>
demands of any kind. She insisted how it might tend to a further<br>
divulging the secret, and might in the end be injurious to him,<br>
entreating him not to press for it; so at length he desisted.<br>
<br>
They had some discourse upon the subject of the things he had lost, and<br>
he seemed to be very desirous of his gold watch, and told her if she<br>
could procure that for him, he would willingly give as much for it as<br>
it was worth. She told him she would endeavour to procure it for him,<br>
and leave the valuing it to himself.<br>
<br>
Accordingly the next day she carried the watch, and he gave her thirty<br>
guineas for it, which was more than I should have been able to make of<br>
it, though it seems it cost much more. He spoke something of his<br>
periwig, which it seems cost him threescore guineas, and his snuff-box,<br>
and in a few days more she carried them too; which obliged him very<br>
much, and he gave her thirty more. The next day I sent him his fine<br>
sword and cane gratis, and demanded nothing of him, but I had no mind<br>
to see him, unless it had been so that he might be satisfied I knew who<br>
he was, which he was not willing to.<br>
<br>
Then he entered into a long talk with her of the manner how she came to<br>
know all this matter. She formed a long tale of that part; how she had<br>
it from one that I had told the whole story to, and that was to help me<br>
dispose of the goods; and this confidante brought the things to her,<br>
she being by profession a pawnbroker; and she hearing of his worship&rsquo;s<br>
disaster, guessed at the thing in general; that having gotten the<br>
things into her hands, she had resolved to come and try as she had<br>
done. She then gave him repeated assurances that it should never go out<br>
of her mouth, and though she knew the woman very well, yet she had not<br>
let her know, meaning me, anything of it; that is to say, who the<br>
person was, which, by the way, was false; but, however, it was not to<br>
his damage, for I never opened my mouth of it to anybody.<br>
<br>
I had a great many thoughts in my head about my seeing him again, and<br>
was often sorry that I had refused it. I was persuaded that if I had<br>
seen him, and let him know that I knew him, I should have made some<br>
advantage of him, and perhaps have had some maintenance from him; and<br>
though it was a life wicked enough, yet it was not so full of danger as<br>
this I was engaged in. However, those thoughts wore off, and I declined<br>
seeing him again, for that time; but my governess saw him often, and he<br>
was very kind to her, giving her something almost every time he saw<br>
her. One time in particular she found him very merry, and as she<br>
thought he had some wine in his head, and he pressed her again very<br>
earnestly to let him see that woman that, as he said, had bewitched him<br>
so that night, my governess, who was from the beginning for my seeing<br>
him, told him he was so desirous of it that she could almost yield of<br>
it, if she could prevail upon me; adding that if he would please to<br>
come to her house in the evening, she would endeavour it, upon his<br>
repeated assurances of forgetting what was past.<br>
<br>
Accordingly she came to me, and told me all the discourse; in short,<br>
she soon biassed me to consent, in a case which I had some regret in my<br>
mind for declining before; so I prepared to see him. I dressed me to<br>
all the advantage possible, I assure you, and for the first time used a<br>
little art; I say for the first time, for I had never yielded to the<br>
baseness of paint before, having always had vanity enough to believe I<br>
had no need of it.<br>
<br>
At the hour appointed he came; and as she observed before, so it was<br>
plain still, that he had been drinking, though very far from what we<br>
call being in drink. He appeared exceeding pleased to see me, and<br>
entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair. I begged his<br>
pardon very often for my share of it, protested I had not any such<br>
design when first I met him, that I had not gone out with him but that<br>
I took him for a very civil gentleman, and that he made me so many<br>
promises of offering no uncivility to me.<br>
<br>
He alleged the wine he drank, and that he scarce knew what he did, and<br>
that if it had not been so, I should never have let him take the<br>
freedom with me that he had done. He protested to me that he never<br>
touched any woman but me since he was married to his wife, and it was a<br>
surprise upon him; complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable<br>
to him, and the like; and talked so much of that kind, till I found he<br>
had talked himself almost into a temper to do the same thing over<br>
again. But I took him up short. I protested I had never suffered any<br>
man to touch me since my husband died, which was near eight years. He<br>
said he believed it to be so truly; and added that madam had intimated<br>
as much to him, and that it was his opinion of that part which made his<br>
desire to see me again; and that since he had once broke in upon his<br>
virtue with me, and found no ill consequences, he could be safe in<br>
venturing there again; and so, in short, it went on to what I expected,<br>
and to what will not bear relating.<br>
<br>
My old governess had foreseen it, as well as I, and therefore led him<br>
into a room which had not a bed in it, and yet had a chamber within it<br>
which had a bed, whither we withdrew for the rest of the night; and, in<br>
short, after some time being together, he went to bed, and lay there<br>
all night. I withdrew, but came again undressed in the morning, before<br>
it was day, and lay with him the rest of the time.<br>
<br>
Thus, you see, having committed a crime once is a sad handle to the<br>
committing of it again; whereas all the regret and reflections wear off<br>
when the temptation renews itself. Had I not yielded to see him again,<br>
the corrupt desire in him had worn off, and &rsquo;tis very probable he had<br>
never fallen into it with anybody else, as I really believe he had not<br>
done before.<br>
<br>
When he went away, I told him I hoped he was satisfied he had not been<br>
robbed again. He told me he was satisfied in that point, and could<br>
trust me again, and putting his hand in his pocket, gave me five<br>
guineas, which was the first money I had gained that way for many<br>
years.<br>
<br>
I had several visits of the like kind from him, but he never came into<br>
a settled way of maintenance, which was what I would have best pleased<br>
with. Once, indeed, he asked me how I did to live. I answered him<br>
pretty quick, that I assured him I had never taken that course that I<br>
took with him, but that indeed I worked at my needle, and could just<br>
maintain myself; that sometime it was as much as I was able to do, and<br>
I shifted hard enough.<br>
<br>
He seemed to reflect upon himself that he should be the first person to<br>
lead me into that, which he assured me he never intended to do himself;<br>
and it touched him a little, he said, that he should be the cause of<br>
his own sin and mine too. He would often make just reflections also<br>
upon the crime itself, and upon the particular circumstances of it with<br>
respect to himself; how wine introduced the inclinations, how the devil<br>
led him to the place, and found out an object to tempt him, and he made<br>
the moral always himself.<br>
<br>
When these thoughts were upon him he would go away, and perhaps not<br>
come again in a month&rsquo;s time or longer; but then as the serious part<br>
wore off, the lewd part would wear in, and then he came prepared for<br>
the wicked part. Thus we lived for some time; though he did not keep,<br>
as they call it, yet he never failed doing things that were handsome,<br>
and sufficient to maintain me without working, and, which was better,<br>
without following my old trade.<br>
<br>
But this affair had its end too; for after about a year, I found that<br>
he did not come so often as usual, and at last he left if off<br>
altogether without any dislike to bidding adieu; and so there was an<br>
end of that short scene of life, which added no great store to me, only<br>
to make more work for repentance.<br>
<br>
However, during this interval I confined myself pretty much at home; at<br>
least, being thus provided for, I made no adventures, no, not for a<br>
quarter of a year after he left me; but then finding the fund fail, and<br>
being loth to spend upon the main stock, I began to think of my old<br>
trade, and to look abroad into the street again; and my first step was<br>
lucky enough.<br>
<br>
I had dressed myself up in a very mean habit, for as I had several<br>
shapes to appear in, I was now in an ordinary stuff-gown, a blue apron,<br>
and a straw hat and I placed myself at the door of the Three Cups Inn<br>
in St. John Street. There were several carriers used the inn, and the<br>
stage-coaches for Barnet, for Totteridge, and other towns that way<br>
stood always in the street in the evening, when they prepared to set<br>
out, so that I was ready for anything that offered, for either one or<br>
other. The meaning was this; people come frequently with bundles and<br>
small parcels to those inns, and call for such carriers or coaches as<br>
they want, to carry them into the country; and there generally attend<br>
women, porters&rsquo; wives or daughters, ready to take in such things for<br>
their respective people that employ them.<br>
<br>
It happened very oddly that I was standing at the inn gate, and a woman<br>
that had stood there before, and which was the porter&rsquo;s wife belonging<br>
to the Barnet stage-coach, having observed me, asked if I waited for<br>
any of the coaches. I told her Yes, I waited for my mistress, that was<br>
coming to go to Barnet. She asked me who was my mistress, and I told<br>
her any madam&rsquo;s name that came next me; but as it seemed, I happened<br>
upon a name, a family of which name lived at Hadley, just beyond<br>
Barnet.<br>
<br>
I said no more to her, or she to me, a good while; but by and by,<br>
somebody calling her at a door a little way off, she desired me that if<br>
anybody called for the Barnet coach, I would step and call her at the<br>
house, which it seems was an alehouse. I said Yes, very readily, and<br>
away she went.<br>
<br>
She was no sooner gone but comes a wench and a child, puffing and<br>
sweating, and asks for the Barnet coach. I answered presently, &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Do you belong to the Barnet coach?&rdquo; says she. &ldquo;Yes, sweetheart,&rdquo; said<br>
I; &ldquo;what do ye want?&rdquo; &ldquo;I want room for two passengers,&rdquo; says she.<br>
&ldquo;Where are they, sweetheart?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s this girl, pray let her<br>
go into the coach,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll go and fetch my mistress.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Make haste, then, sweetheart,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;for we may be full else.&rdquo; The<br>
maid had a great bundle under her arm; so she put the child into the<br>
coach, and I said, &ldquo;You had best put your bundle into the coach too.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I am afraid somebody should slip it away from the<br>
child.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give to me, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll take care of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do,<br>
then,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;and be sure you take of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for it,&rdquo;<br>
said I, &ldquo;if it were for &pound;20 value.&rdquo; &ldquo;There, take it, then,&rdquo; says she,<br>
and away she goes.<br>
<br>
As soon as I had got the bundle, and the maid was out of sight, I goes<br>
on towards the alehouse, where the porter&rsquo;s wife was, so that if I had<br>
met her, I had then only been going to give her the bundle, and to call<br>
her to her business, as if I was going away, and could stay no longer;<br>
but as I did not meet her, I walked away, and turning into Charterhouse<br>
Lane, then crossed into Bartholomew Close, so into Little Britain, and<br>
through the Bluecoat Hospital, into Newgate Street.<br>
<br>
To prevent my being known, I pulled off my blue apron, and wrapped the<br>
bundle in it, which before was made up in a piece of painted calico,<br>
and very remarkable; I also wrapped up my straw hat in it, and so put<br>
the bundle upon my head; and it was very well that I did thus, for<br>
coming through the Bluecoat Hospital, who should I meet but the wench<br>
that had given me the bundle to hold. It seems she was going with her<br>
mistress, whom she had been gone to fetch, to the Barnet coaches.<br>
<br>
I saw she was in haste, and I had no business to stop her; so away she<br>
went, and I brought my bundle safe home to my governess. There was no<br>
money, nor plate, or jewels in the bundle, but a very good suit of<br>
Indian damask, a gown and a petticoat, a laced-head and ruffles of very<br>
good Flanders lace, and some linen and other things, such as I knew<br>
very well the value of.<br>
<br>
This was not indeed my own invention, but was given me by one that had<br>
practised it with success, and my governess liked it extremely; and<br>
indeed I tried it again several times, though never twice near the same<br>
place; for the next time I tried it in White Chapel, just by the corner<br>
of Petticoat Lane, where the coaches stand that go out to Stratford and<br>
Bow, and that side of the country, and another time at the Flying<br>
Horse, without Bishopgate, where the Cheston coaches then lay; and I<br>
had always the good luck to come off with some booty.<br>
<br>
Another time I placed myself at a warehouse by the waterside, where the<br>
coasting vessels from the north come, such as from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,<br>
Sunderland, and other places. Here, the warehouses being shut, comes a<br>
young fellow with a letter; and he wanted a box and a hamper that was<br>
come from Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I asked him if he had the marks of it;<br>
so he shows me the letter, by virtue of which he was to ask for it, and<br>
which gave an account of the contents, the box being full of linen, and<br>
the hamper full of glass ware. I read the letter, and took care to see<br>
the name, and the marks, the name of the person that sent the goods,<br>
the name of the person that they were sent to; then I bade the<br>
messenger come in the morning, for that the warehouse-keeper would not<br>
be there any more that night.<br>
<br>
Away went I, and getting materials in a public house, I wrote a letter<br>
from Mr. John Richardson of Newcastle to his dear cousin Jemmy Cole, in<br>
London, with an account that he sent by such a vessel (for I remembered<br>
all the particulars to a title), so many pieces of huckaback linen, so<br>
many ells of Dutch holland and the like, in a box, and a hamper of<br>
flint glasses from Mr. Henzill&rsquo;s glasshouse; and that the box was<br>
marked I. C. No. 1, and the hamper was directed by a label on the<br>
cording.<br>
<br>
About an hour after, I came to the warehouse, found the<br>
warehouse-keeper, and had the goods delivered me without any scruple;<br>
the value of the linen being about &pound;22.<br>
<br>
I could fill up this whole discourse with the variety of such<br>
adventures, which daily invention directed to, and which I managed with<br>
the utmost dexterity, and always with success.<br>
<br>
At length&mdash;as when does the pitcher come safe home that goes so very<br>
often to the well?&mdash;I fell into some small broils, which though they<br>
could not affect me fatally, yet made me known, which was the worst<br>
thing next to being found guilty that could befall me.<br>
<br>
I had taken up the disguise of a widow&rsquo;s dress; it was without any real<br>
design in view, but only waiting for anything that might offer, as I<br>
often did. It happened that while I was going along the street in<br>
Covent Garden, there was a great cry of &ldquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rdquo; some<br>
artists had, it seems, put a trick upon a shopkeeper, and being<br>
pursued, some of them fled one way, and some another; and one of them<br>
was, they said, dressed up in widow&rsquo;s weeds, upon which the mob<br>
gathered about me, and some said I was the person, others said no.<br>
Immediately came the mercer&rsquo;s journeyman, and he swore aloud I was the<br>
person, and so seized on me. However, when I was brought back by the<br>
mob to the mercer&rsquo;s shop, the master of the house said freely that I<br>
was not the woman that was in his shop, and would have let me go<br>
immediately; but another fellow said gravely, &ldquo;Pray stay till Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
(meaning the journeyman) &ldquo;comes back, for he knows her.&rdquo; So they kept<br>
me by force near half an hour. They had called a constable, and he<br>
stood in the shop as my jailer; and in talking with the constable I<br>
inquired where he lived, and what trade he was; the man not<br>
apprehending in the least what happened afterwards, readily told me his<br>
name, and trade, and where he lived; and told me as a jest, that I<br>
might be sure to hear of his name when I came to the Old Bailey.<br>
<br>
Some of the servants likewise used me saucily, and had much ado to keep<br>
their hands off me; the master indeed was civiller to me than they, but<br>
he would not yet let me go, though he owned he could not say I was in<br>
his shop before.<br>
<br>
I began to be a little surly with him, and told him I hoped he would<br>
not take it ill if I made myself amends upon him in a more legal way<br>
another time; and desired I might send for friends to see me have right<br>
done me. No, he said, he could give no such liberty; I might ask it<br>
when I came before the justice of peace; and seeing I threatened him,<br>
he would take care of me in the meantime, and would lodge me safe in<br>
Newgate. I told him it was his time now, but it would be mine by and<br>
by, and governed my passion as well as I was able. However, I spoke to<br>
the constable to call me a porter, which he did, and then I called for<br>
pen, ink, and paper, but they would let me have none. I asked the<br>
porter his name, and where he lived, and the poor man told it me very<br>
willingly. I bade him observe and remember how I was treated there;<br>
that he saw I was detained there by force. I told him I should want his<br>
evidence in another place, and it should not be the worse for him to<br>
speak. The porter said he would serve me with all his heart. &ldquo;But,<br>
madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;let me hear them refuse to let you go, then I may be<br>
able to speak the plainer.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
With that I spoke aloud to the master of the shop, and said, &ldquo;Sir, you<br>
know in your own conscience that I am not the person you look for, and<br>
that I was not in your shop before, therefore I demand that you detain<br>
me here no longer, or tell me the reason of your stopping me.&rdquo; The<br>
fellow grew surlier upon this than before, and said he would do neither<br>
till he thought fit. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I to the constable and to the<br>
porter; &ldquo;you will be pleased to remember this, gentlemen, another<br>
time.&rdquo; The porter said, &ldquo;Yes, madam&rdquo;; and the constable began not to<br>
like it, and would have persuaded the mercer to dismiss him, and let me<br>
go, since, as he said, he owned I was not the person. &ldquo;Good, sir,&rdquo; says<br>
the mercer to him tauntingly, &ldquo;are you a justice of peace or a<br>
constable? I charged you with her; pray do you do your duty.&rdquo; The<br>
constable told him, a little moved, but very handsomely, &ldquo;I know my<br>
duty, and what I am, sir; I doubt you hardly know what you are doing.&rdquo;<br>
They had some other hard words, and in the meantime the journeyman,<br>
impudent and unmanly to the last degree, used me barbarously, and one<br>
of them, the same that first seized upon me, pretended he would search<br>
me, and began to lay hands on me. I spit in his face, called out to the<br>
constable, and bade him to take notice of my usage. &ldquo;And pray, Mr.<br>
Constable,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;ask that villain&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; pointing to the man. The<br>
constable reproved him decently, told him that he did not know what he<br>
did, for he knew that his master acknowledged I was not the person that<br>
was in his shop; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; says the constable, &ldquo;I am afraid your master is<br>
bringing himself, and me too, into trouble, if this gentlewoman comes<br>
to prove who she is, and where she was, and it appears that she is not<br>
the woman you pretend to.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damn her,&rdquo; says the fellow again, with a<br>
impudent, hardened face, &ldquo;she is the lady, you may depend upon it; I&rsquo;ll<br>
swear she is the same body that was in the shop, and that I gave the<br>
pieces of satin that is lost into her own hand. You shall hear more of<br>
it when Mr. William and Mr. Anthony (those were other journeymen) come<br>
back; they will know her again as well as I.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Just as the insolent rogue was talking thus to the constable, comes<br>
back Mr. William and Mr. Anthony, as he called them, and a great rabble<br>
with them, bringing along with them the true widow that I was pretended<br>
to be; and they came sweating and blowing into the shop, and with a<br>
great deal of triumph, dragging the poor creature in the most butcherly<br>
manner up towards their master, who was in the back shop, and cried out<br>
aloud, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the widow, sir; we have catched her at last.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do<br>
ye mean by that?&rdquo; says the master. &ldquo;Why, we have her already; there she<br>
sits,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and Mr. &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;can swear this is she.&rdquo; The<br>
other man, whom they called Mr. Anthony, replied, &ldquo;Mr. &mdash;&mdash; may say what<br>
he will, and swear what he will, but this is the woman, and there&rsquo;s the<br>
remnant of satin she stole; I took it out of her clothes with my own<br>
hand.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I sat still now, and began to take a better heart, but smiled and said<br>
nothing; the master looked pale; the constable turned about and looked<br>
at me. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em alone, Mr. Constable,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;let &ldquo;em go on.&rdquo; The<br>
case was plain and could not be denied, so the constable was charged<br>
with the right thief, and the mercer told me very civilly he was sorry<br>
for the mistake, and hoped I would not take it ill; that they had so<br>
many things of this nature put upon them every day, that they could not<br>
be blamed for being very sharp in doing themselves justice. &ldquo;Not take<br>
it ill, sir!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;how can I take it well! If you had dismissed me<br>
when your insolent fellow seized on me it the street, and brought me to<br>
you, and when you yourself acknowledged I was not the person, I would<br>
have put it by, and not taken it ill, because of the many ill things I<br>
believe you have put upon you daily; but your treatment of me since has<br>
been insufferable, and especially that of your servant; I must and will<br>
have reparation for that.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then he began to parley with me, said he would make me any reasonable<br>
satisfaction, and would fain have had me tell him what it was I<br>
expected. I told him that I should not be my own judge, the law should<br>
decide it for me; and as I was to be carried before a magistrate, I<br>
should let him hear there what I had to say. He told me there was no<br>
occasion to go before the justice now, I was at liberty to go where I<br>
pleased; and so, calling to the constable, told him he might let me go,<br>
for I was discharged. The constable said calmly to him, &ldquo;sir, you asked<br>
me just now if I knew whether I was a constable or justice, and bade me<br>
do my duty, and charged me with this gentlewoman as a prisoner. Now,<br>
sir, I find you do not understand what is my duty, for you would make<br>
me a justice indeed; but I must tell you it is not in my power. I may<br>
keep a prisoner when I am charged with him, but &rsquo;tis the law and the<br>
magistrate alone that can discharge that prisoner; therefore &rsquo;tis a<br>
mistake, sir; I must carry her before a justice now, whether you think<br>
well of it or not.&rdquo; The mercer was very high with the constable at<br>
first; but the constable happening to be not a hired officer, but a<br>
good, substantial kind of man (I think he was a corn-handler), and a<br>
man of good sense, stood to his business, would not discharge me<br>
without going to a justice of the peace; and I insisted upon it too.<br>
When the mercer saw that, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he to the constable, &ldquo;you may<br>
carry her where you please; I have nothing to say to her.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo;<br>
says the constable, &ldquo;you will go with us, I hope, for &rsquo;tis you that<br>
charged me with her.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not I,&rdquo; says the mercer; &ldquo;I tell you I have<br>
nothing to say to her.&rdquo; &ldquo;But pray, sir, do,&rdquo; says the constable; &ldquo;I<br>
desire it of you for your own sake, for the justice can do nothing<br>
without you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Prithee, fellow,&rdquo; says the mercer, &ldquo;go about your<br>
business; I tell you I have nothing to say to the gentlewoman. I charge<br>
you in the king&rsquo;s name to dismiss her.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; says the constable, &ldquo;I<br>
find you don&rsquo;t know what it is to be constable; I beg of you don&rsquo;t<br>
oblige me to be rude to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;I think I need not; you are rude enough<br>
already,&rdquo; says the mercer. &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; says the constable, &ldquo;I am not<br>
rude; you have broken the peace in bringing an honest woman out of the<br>
street, when she was about her lawful occasion, confining her in your<br>
shop, and ill-using her here by your servants; and now can you say I am<br>
rude to you? I think I am civil to you in not commanding or charging<br>
you in the king&rsquo;s name to go with me, and charging every man I see that<br>
passes your door to aid and assist me in carrying you by force; this<br>
you cannot but know I have power to do, and yet I forbear it, and once<br>
more entreat you to go with me.&rdquo; Well, he would not for all this, and<br>
gave the constable ill language. However, the constable kept his<br>
temper, and would not be provoked; and then I put in and said, &ldquo;Come,<br>
Mr. Constable, let him alone; I shall find ways enough to fetch him<br>
before a magistrate, I don&rsquo;t fear that; but there&rsquo;s the fellow,&rdquo; says<br>
I, &ldquo;he was the man that seized on me as I was innocently going along<br>
the street, and you are a witness of the violence with me since; give<br>
me leave to charge you with him, and carry him before the justice.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; says the constable; and turning to the fellow &ldquo;Come,<br>
young gentleman,&rdquo; says he to the journeyman, &ldquo;you must go along with<br>
us; I hope you are not above the constable&rsquo;s power, though your master<br>
is.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The fellow looked like a condemned thief, and hung back, then looked at<br>
his master, as if he could help him; and he, like a fool, encourage the<br>
fellow to be rude, and he truly resisted the constable, and pushed him<br>
back with a good force when he went to lay hold on him, at which the<br>
constable knocked him down, and called out for help; and immediately<br>
the shop was filled with people, and the constable seized the master<br>
and man, and all his servants.<br>
<br>
This first ill consequence of this fray was, that the woman they had<br>
taken, who was really the thief, made off, and got clear away in the<br>
crowd; and two other that they had stopped also; whether they were<br>
really guilty or not, that I can say nothing to.<br>
<br>
By this time some of his neighbours having come in, and, upon inquiry,<br>
seeing how things went, had endeavoured to bring the hot-brained mercer<br>
to his senses, and he began to be convinced that he was in the wrong;<br>
and so at length we went all very quietly before the justice, with a<br>
mob of about five hundred people at our heels; and all the way I went I<br>
could hear the people ask what was the matter, and other reply and say,<br>
a mercer had stopped a gentlewoman instead of a thief, and had<br>
afterwards taken the thief, and now the gentlewoman had taken the<br>
mercer, and was carrying him before the justice. This pleased the<br>
people strangely, and made the crowd increase, and they cried out as<br>
they went, &ldquo;Which is the rogue? which is the mercer?&rdquo; and especially<br>
the women. Then when they saw him they cried out, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s he, that&rsquo;s<br>
he&rdquo;; and every now and then came a good dab of dirt at him; and thus we<br>
marched a good while, till the mercer thought fit to desire the<br>
constable to call a coach to protect himself from the rabble; so we<br>
rode the rest of the way, the constable and I, and the mercer and his<br>
man.<br>
<br>
When we came to the justice, which was an ancient gentleman in<br>
Bloomsbury, the constable giving first a summary account of the matter,<br>
the justice bade me speak, and tell what I had to say. And first he<br>
asked my name, which I was very loth to give, but there was no remedy,<br>
so I told him my name was Mary Flanders, that I was a widow, my husband<br>
being a sea captain, died on a voyage to Virginia; and some other<br>
circumstances I told which he could never contradict, and that I lodged<br>
at present in town with such a person, naming my governess; but that I<br>
was preparing to go over to America, where my husband&rsquo;s effects lay,<br>
and that I was going that day to buy some clothes to put myself into<br>
second mourning, but had not yet been in any shop, when that fellow,<br>
pointing to the mercer&rsquo;s journeyman, came rushing upon me with such<br>
fury as very much frighted me, and carried me back to his master&rsquo;s<br>
shop, where, though his master acknowledged I was not the person, yet<br>
he would not dismiss me, but charged a constable with me.<br>
<br>
Then I proceeded to tell how the journeyman treated me; how they would<br>
not suffer me to send for any of my friends; how afterwards they found<br>
the real thief, and took the very goods they had lost upon her, and all<br>
the particulars as before.<br>
<br>
Then the constable related his case: his dialogue with the mercer about<br>
discharging me, and at last his servant&rsquo;s refusing to go with him, when<br>
he had charged him with him, and his master encouraging him to do so,<br>
and at last his striking the constable, and the like, all as I have<br>
told it already.<br>
<br>
The justice then heard the mercer and his man. The mercer indeed made a<br>
long harangue of the great loss they have daily by lifters and thieves;<br>
that it was easy for them to mistake, and that when he found it he<br>
would have dismissed me, etc., as above. As to the journeyman, he had<br>
very little to say, but that he pretended other of the servants told<br>
him that I was really the person.<br>
<br>
Upon the whole, the justice first of all told me very courteously I was<br>
discharged; that he was very sorry that the mercer&rsquo;s man should in his<br>
eager pursuit have so little discretion as to take up an innocent<br>
person for a guilty person; that if he had not been so unjust as to<br>
detain me afterward, he believed I would have forgiven the first<br>
affront; that, however, it was not in his power to award me any<br>
reparation for anything, other than by openly reproving them, which he<br>
should do; but he supposed I would apply to such methods as the law<br>
directed; in the meantime he would bind him over.<br>
<br>
But as to the breach of the peace committed by the journeyman, he told<br>
me he should give me some satisfaction for that, for he should commit<br>
him to Newgate for assaulting the constable, and for assaulting me<br>
also.<br>
<br>
Accordingly he sent the fellow to Newgate for that assault, and his<br>
master gave bail, and so we came away; but I had the satisfaction of<br>
seeing the mob wait upon them both, as they came out, hallooing and<br>
throwing stones and dirt at the coaches they rode in; and so I came<br>
home to my governess.<br>
<br>
After this hustle, coming home and telling my governess the story, she<br>
falls a-laughing at me. &ldquo;Why are you merry?&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;the story has not<br>
so much laughing room in it as you imagine; I am sure I have had a<br>
great deal of hurry and fright too, with a pack of ugly rogues.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Laugh!&rdquo; says my governess; &ldquo;I laugh, child, to see what a lucky<br>
creature you are; why, this job will be the best bargain to you that<br>
ever you made in your life, if you manage it well. I warrant you,&rdquo; says<br>
she, &ldquo;you shall make the mercer pay you &pound;500 for damages, besides what<br>
you shall get out of the journeyman.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I had other thoughts of the matter than she had; and especially,<br>
because I had given in my name to the justice of peace; and I knew that<br>
my name was so well known among the people at Hick&rsquo;s Hall, the Old<br>
Bailey, and such places, that if this cause came to be tried openly,<br>
and my name came to be inquired into, no court would give much damages,<br>
for the reputation of a person of such a character. However, I was<br>
obliged to begin a prosecution in form, and accordingly my governess<br>
found me out a very creditable sort of a man to manage it, being an<br>
attorney of very good business, and of a good reputation, and she was<br>
certainly in the right of this; for had she employed a pettifogging<br>
hedge solicitor, or a man not known, and not in good reputation, I<br>
should have brought it to but little.<br>
<br>
I met this attorney, and gave him all the particulars at large, as they<br>
are recited above; and he assured me it was a case, as he said, that<br>
would very well support itself, and that he did not question but that a<br>
jury would give very considerable damages on such an occasion; so<br>
taking his full instructions he began the prosecution, and the mercer<br>
being arrested, gave bail. A few days after his giving bail, he comes<br>
with his attorney to my attorney, to let him know that he desired to<br>
accommodate the matter; that it was all carried on in the heat of an<br>
unhappy passion; that his client, meaning me, had a sharp provoking<br>
tongue, that I used them ill, gibing at them, and jeering them, even<br>
while they believed me to be the very person, and that I had provoked<br>
them, and the like.<br>
<br>
My attorney managed as well on my side; made them believe I was a widow<br>
of fortune, that I was able to do myself justice, and had great friends<br>
to stand by me too, who had all made me promise to sue to the utmost,<br>
and that if it cost me a thousand pounds I would be sure to have<br>
satisfaction, for that the affronts I had received were insufferable.<br>
<br>
However, they brought my attorney to this, that he promised he would<br>
not blow the coals, that if I inclined to accommodation, he would not<br>
hinder me, and that he would rather persuade me to peace than to war;<br>
for which they told him he should be no loser; all which he told me<br>
very honestly, and told me that if they offered him any bribe, I should<br>
certainly know it; but upon the whole he told me very honestly that if<br>
I would take his opinion, he would advise me to make it up with them,<br>
for that as they were in a great fright, and were desirous above all<br>
things to make it up, and knew that, let it be what it would, they<br>
would be allotted to bear all the costs of the suit; he believed they<br>
would give me freely more than any jury or court of justice would give<br>
upon a trial. I asked him what he thought they would be brought to. He<br>
told me he could not tell as to that, but he would tell me more when I<br>
saw him again.<br>
<br>
Some time after this, they came again to know if he had talked with me.<br>
He told them he had; that he found me not so averse to an accommodation<br>
as some of my friends were, who resented the disgrace offered me, and<br>
set me on; that they blowed the coals in secret, prompting me to<br>
revenge, or do myself justice, as they called it; so that he could not<br>
tell what to say to it; he told them he would do his endeavour to<br>
persuade me, but he ought to be able to tell me what proposal they<br>
made. They pretended they could not make any proposal, because it might<br>
be made use of against them; and he told them, that by the same rule he<br>
could not make any offers, for that might be pleaded in abatement of<br>
what damages a jury might be inclined to give. However, after some<br>
discourse and mutual promises that no advantage should be taken on<br>
either side, by what was transacted then or at any other of those<br>
meetings, they came to a kind of a treaty; but so remote, and so wide<br>
from one another, that nothing could be expected from it; for my<br>
attorney demanded &pound;500 and charges, and they offered &pound;50 without<br>
charges; so they broke off, and the mercer proposed to have a meeting<br>
with me myself; and my attorney agreed to that very readily.<br>
<br>
My attorney gave me notice to come to this meeting in good clothes, and<br>
with some state, that the mercer might see I was something more than I<br>
seemed to be that time they had me. Accordingly I came in a new suit of<br>
second mourning, according to what I had said at the justice&rsquo;s. I set<br>
myself out, too, as well as a widow&rsquo;s dress in second mourning would<br>
admit; my governess also furnished me with a good pearl necklace, that<br>
shut in behind with a locket of diamonds, which she had in pawn; and I<br>
had a very good figure; and as I stayed till I was sure they were come,<br>
I came in a coach to the door, with my maid with me.<br>
<br>
When I came into the room the mercer was surprised. He stood up and<br>
made his bow, which I took a little notice of, and but a little, and<br>
went and sat down where my own attorney had pointed to me to sit, for<br>
it was his house. After a little while the mercer said, he did not know<br>
me again, and began to make some compliments his way. I told him, I<br>
believed he did not know me at first, and that if he had, I believed he<br>
would not have treated me as he did.<br>
<br>
He told me he was very sorry for what had happened, and that it was to<br>
testify the willingness he had to make all possible reparation that he<br>
had appointed this meeting; that he hoped I would not carry things to<br>
extremity, which might be not only too great a loss to him, but might<br>
be the ruin of his business and shop, in which case I might have the<br>
satisfaction of repaying an injury with an injury ten times greater;<br>
but that I would then get nothing, whereas he was willing to do me any<br>
justice that was in his power, without putting himself or me to the<br>
trouble or charge of a suit at law.<br>
<br>
I told him I was glad to hear him talk so much more like a man of sense<br>
than he did before; that it was true, acknowledgment in most cases of<br>
affronts was counted reparation sufficient; but this had gone too far<br>
to be made up so; that I was not revengeful, nor did I seek his ruin,<br>
or any man&rsquo;s else, but that all my friends were unanimous not to let me<br>
so far neglect my character as to adjust a thing of this kind without a<br>
sufficient reparation of honour; that to be taken up for a thief was<br>
such an indignity as could not be put up; that my character was above<br>
being treated so by any that knew me, but because in my condition of a<br>
widow I had been for some time careless of myself, and negligent of<br>
myself, I might be taken for such a creature, but that for the<br>
particular usage I had from him afterwards,&mdash;and then I repeated all as<br>
before; it was so provoking I had scarce patience to repeat it.<br>
<br>
Well, he acknowledged all, and was might humble indeed; he made<br>
proposals very handsome; he came up to &pound;100 and to pay all the law<br>
charges, and added that he would make me a present of a very good suit<br>
of clothes. I came down to &pound;300, and I demanded that I should publish<br>
an advertisement of the particulars in the common newspapers.<br>
<br>
This was a clause he never could comply with. However, at last he came<br>
up, by good management of my attorney, to &pound;150 and a suit of black silk<br>
clothes; and there I agree, and as it were, at my attorney&rsquo;s request,<br>
complied with it, he paying my attorney&rsquo;s bill and charges, and gave us<br>
a good supper into the bargain.<br>
<br>
When I came to receive the money, I brought my governess with me,<br>
dressed like an old duchess, and a gentleman very well dressed, who we<br>
pretended courted me, but I called him cousin, and the lawyer was only<br>
to hint privately to him that his gentleman courted the widow.<br>
<br>
He treated us handsomely indeed, and paid the money cheerfully enough;<br>
so that it cost him &pound;200 in all, or rather more. At our last meeting,<br>
when all was agreed, the case of the journeyman came up, and the mercer<br>
begged very hard for him; told me he was a man that had kept a shop of<br>
his own, and been in good business, had a wife, and several children,<br>
and was very poor; that he had nothing to make satisfaction with, but<br>
he should come to beg my pardon on his knees, if I desired it, as<br>
openly as I pleased. I had no spleen at the saucy rogue, nor were his<br>
submissions anything to me, since there was nothing to be got by him,<br>
so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not; so I<br>
told him I did not desire the ruin of any man, and therefore at his<br>
request I would forgive the wretch; it was below me to seek any<br>
revenge.<br>
<br>
When we were at supper he brought the poor fellow in to make<br>
acknowledgment, which he would have done with as much mean humility as<br>
his offence was with insulting haughtiness and pride, in which he was<br>
an instance of a complete baseness of spirit, impious, cruel, and<br>
relentless when uppermost and in prosperity, abject and low-spirited<br>
when down in affliction. However, I abated his cringes, told him I<br>
forgave him, and desired he might withdraw, as if I did not care for<br>
the sight of him, though I had forgiven him.<br>
<br>
I was now in good circumstances indeed, if I could have known my time<br>
for leaving off, and my governess often said I was the richest of the<br>
trade in England; and so I believe I was, for I had &pound;700 by me in<br>
money, besides clothes, rings, some plate, and two gold watches, and<br>
all of them stolen, for I had innumerable jobs besides these I have<br>
mentioned. Oh! had I even now had the grace of repentance, I had still<br>
leisure to have looked back upon my follies, and have made some<br>
reparation; but the satisfaction I was to make for the public mischiefs<br>
I had done was yet left behind; and I could not forbear going abroad<br>
again, as I called it now, than any more I could when my extremity<br>
really drove me out for bread.<br>
<br>
It was not long after the affair with the mercer was made up, that I<br>
went out in an equipage quite different from any I had ever appeared in<br>
before. I dressed myself like a beggar woman, in the coarsest and most<br>
despicable rags I could get, and I walked about peering and peeping<br>
into every door and window I came near; and indeed I was in such a<br>
plight now that I knew as ill how to behave in as ever I did in any. I<br>
naturally abhorred dirt and rags; I had been bred up tight and cleanly,<br>
and could be no other, whatever condition I was in; so that this was<br>
the most uneasy disguise to me that ever I put on. I said presently to<br>
myself that this would not do, for this was a dress that everybody was<br>
shy and afraid of; and I thought everybody looked at me, as if they<br>
were afraid I should come near them, lest I should take something from<br>
them, or afraid to come near me, lest they should get something from<br>
me. I wandered about all the evening the first time I went out, and<br>
made nothing of it, but came home again wet, draggled, and tired.<br>
However, I went out again the next night, and then I met with a little<br>
adventure, which had like to have cost me dear. As I was standing near<br>
a tavern door, there comes a gentleman on horseback, and lights at the<br>
door, and wanting to go into the tavern, he calls one of the drawers to<br>
hold his horse. He stayed pretty long in the tavern, and the drawer<br>
heard his master call, and thought he would be angry with him. Seeing<br>
me stand by him, he called to me, &ldquo;Here, woman,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;hold this<br>
horse a while, till I go in; if the gentleman comes, he&rsquo;ll give you<br>
something.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says I, and takes the horse, and walks off with him<br>
very soberly, and carried him to my governess.<br>
<br>
This had been a booty to those that had understood it; but never was<br>
poor thief more at a loss to know what to do with anything that was<br>
stolen; for when I came home, my governess was quite confounded, and<br>
what to do with the creature, we neither of us knew. To send him to a<br>
stable was doing nothing, for it was certain that public notice would<br>
be given in the _Gazette_, and the horse described, so that we durst<br>
not go to fetch it again.<br>
<br>
All the remedy we had for this unlucky adventure was to go and set up<br>
the horse at an inn, and send a note by a porter to the tavern, that<br>
the gentleman&rsquo;s horse that was lost such a time was left at such an<br>
inn, and that he might be had there; that the poor woman that held him,<br>
having led him about the street, not being able to lead him back again,<br>
had left him there. We might have waited till the owner had published<br>
and offered a reward, but we did not care to venture the receiving the<br>
reward.<br>
<br>
So this was a robbery and no robbery, for little was lost by it, and<br>
nothing was got by it, and I was quite sick of going out in a beggar&rsquo;s<br>
dress; it did not answer at all, and besides, I thought it was ominous<br>
and threatening.<br>
<br>
While I was in this disguise, I fell in with a parcel of folks of a<br>
worse kind than any I ever sorted with, and I saw a little into their<br>
ways too. These were coiners of money, and they made some very good<br>
offers to me, as to profit; but the part they would have had me have<br>
embarked in was the most dangerous part. I mean that of the very<br>
working the die, as they call it, which, had I been taken, had been<br>
certain death, and that at a stake&mdash;I say, to be burnt to death at a<br>
stake; so that though I was to appearance but a beggar, and they<br>
promised mountains of gold and silver to me to engage, yet it would not<br>
do. It is true, if I had been really a beggar, or had been desperate as<br>
when I began, I might perhaps have closed with it; for what care they<br>
to die that can&rsquo;t tell how to live? But at present this was not my<br>
condition, at least I was for no such terrible risks as those; besides,<br>
the very thoughts of being burnt at a stake struck terror into my very<br>
soul, chilled my blood, and gave me the vapours to such a degree, as I<br>
could not think of it without trembling.<br>
<br>
This put an end to my disguise too, for as I did not like the proposal,<br>
so I did not tell them so, but seemed to relish it, and promised to<br>
meet again. But I durst see them no more; for if I had seen them, and<br>
not complied, though I had declined it with the greatest assurance of<br>
secrecy in the world, they would have gone near to have murdered me, to<br>
make sure work, and make themselves easy, as they call it. What kind of<br>
easiness that is, they may best judge that understand how easy men are<br>
that can murder people to prevent danger.<br>
<br>
This and horse-stealing were things quite out of my way, and I might<br>
easily resolve I would have no more to say to them; my business seemed<br>
to lie another way, and though it had hazard enough in it too, yet it<br>
was more suitable to me, and what had more of art in it, and more room<br>
to escape, and more chances for a-coming off if a surprise should<br>
happen.<br>
<br>
I had several proposals made also to me about that time, to come into a<br>
gang of house-breakers; but that was a thing I had no mind to venture<br>
at neither, any more than I had at the coining trade. I offered to go<br>
along with two men and a woman, that made it their business to get into<br>
houses by stratagem, and with them I was willing enough to venture. But<br>
there were three of them already, and they did not care to part, nor I<br>
to have too many in a gang, so I did not close with them, but declined<br>
them, and they paid dear for their next attempt.<br>
<br>
But at length I met with a woman that had often told me what adventures<br>
she had made, and with success, at the waterside, and I closed with<br>
her, and we drove on our business pretty well. One day we came among<br>
some Dutch people at St. Catherine&rsquo;s, where we went on pretence to buy<br>
goods that were privately got on shore. I was two or three times in a<br>
house where we saw a good quantity of prohibited goods, and my<br>
companion once brought away three pieces of Dutch black silk that<br>
turned to good account, and I had my share of it; but in all the<br>
journeys I made by myself, I could not get an opportunity to do<br>
anything, so I laid it aside, for I had been so often, that they began<br>
to suspect something, and were so shy, that I saw nothing was to be<br>
done.<br>
<br>
This baulked me a little, and I resolved to push at something or other,<br>
for I was not used to come back so often without purchase; so the next<br>
day I dressed myself up fine, and took a walk to the other end of the<br>
town. I passed through the Exchange in the Strand, but had no notion of<br>
finding anything to do there, when on a sudden I saw a great cluttering<br>
in the place, and all the people, shopkeepers as well as others,<br>
standing up and staring; and what should it be but some great duchess<br>
come into the Exchange, and they said the queen was coming. I set<br>
myself close up to a shop-side with my back to the counter, as if to<br>
let the crowd pass by, when keeping my eye upon a parcel of lace which<br>
the shopkeeper was showing to some ladies that stood by me, the<br>
shopkeeper and her maid were so taken up with looking to see who was<br>
coming, and what shop they would go to, that I found means to slip a<br>
paper of lace into my pocket and come clear off with it; so the<br>
lady-milliner paid dear enough for her gaping after the queen.<br>
<br>
I went off from the shop, as if driven along by the throng, and<br>
mingling myself with the crowd, went out at the other door of the<br>
Exchange, and so got away before they missed their lace; and because I<br>
would not be followed, I called a coach and shut myself up in it. I had<br>
scarce shut the coach doors up, but I saw the milliner&rsquo;s maid and five<br>
or six more come running out into the street, and crying out as if they<br>
were frightened. They did not cry &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo; because nobody ran<br>
away, but I could hear the word &ldquo;robbed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lace,&rdquo; two or three<br>
times, and saw the wench wringing her hands, and run staring to and<br>
again, like one scared. The coachman that had taken me up was getting<br>
up into the box, but was not quite up, so that the horse had not begun<br>
to move; so that I was terrible uneasy, and I took the packet of lace<br>
and laid it ready to have dropped it out at the flap of the coach,<br>
which opens before, just behind the coachman; but to my great<br>
satisfaction, in less than a minute the coach began to move, that is to<br>
say, as soon as the coachman had got up and spoken to his horses; so he<br>
drove away without any interruption, and I brought off my purchase,<br>
which was worth near &pound;20.<br>
<br>
The next day I dressed up again, but in quite different clothes, and<br>
walked the same way again, but nothing offered till I came into St.<br>
James&rsquo;s Park, where I saw abundance of fine ladies in the Park, walking<br>
in the Mall, and among the rest there was a little miss, a young lady<br>
of about twelve or thirteen years old, and she had a sister, as I<br>
suppose it was, with her, that might be about nine years old. I<br>
observed the biggest had a fine gold watch on, and a good necklace of<br>
pearl, and they had a footman in livery with them; but as it is not<br>
usual for the footman to go behind the ladies in the Mall, so I<br>
observed the footman stopped at their going into the Mall, and the<br>
biggest of the sisters spoke to him, which I perceived was to bid him<br>
be just there when they came back.<br>
<br>
When I heard her dismiss the footman, I stepped up to him and asked<br>
him, what little lady that was? and held a little chat with him about<br>
what a pretty child it was with her, and how genteel and well-carriaged<br>
the lady, the eldest, would be: how womanish, and how grave; and the<br>
fool of a fellow told me presently who she was; that she was Sir Thomas<br>
&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s eldest daughter, of Essex, and that she was a great fortune; that<br>
her mother was not come to town yet; but she was with Sir William &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s<br>
lady, of Suffolk, at her lodging in Suffolk Street, and a great deal<br>
more; that they had a maid and a woman to wait on them, besides Sir<br>
Thomas&rsquo;s coach, the coachman, and himself; and that young lady was<br>
governess to the whole family, as well here as at home too; and, in<br>
short, told me abundance of things enough for my business.<br>
<br>
I was very well dressed, and had my gold watch as well as she; so I<br>
left the footman, and I puts myself in a rank with this young lady,<br>
having stayed till she had taken one double turn in the Mall, and was<br>
going forward again; by and by I saluted her by her name, with the<br>
title of Lady Betty. I asked her when she heard from her father; when<br>
my lady her mother would be in town, and how she did.<br>
<br>
I talked so familiarly to her of her whole family that she could not<br>
suspect but that I knew them all intimately. I asked her why she would<br>
come abroad without Mrs. Chime with her (that was the name of her<br>
woman) to take of Mrs. Judith, that was her sister. Then I entered into<br>
a long chat with her about her sister, what a fine little lady she was,<br>
and asked her if she had learned French, and a thousand such little<br>
things to entertain her, when on a sudden we saw the guards come, and<br>
the crowd ran to see the king go by to the Parliament House.<br>
<br>
The ladies ran all to the side of the Mall, and I helped my lady to<br>
stand upon the edge of the boards on the side of the Mall, that she<br>
might be high enough to see; and took the little one and lifted her<br>
quite up; during which, I took care to convey the gold watch so clean<br>
away from the Lady Betty, that she never felt it, nor missed it, till<br>
all the crowd was gone, and she was gotten into the middle of the Mall<br>
among the other ladies.<br>
<br>
I took my leave of her in the very crowd, and said to her, as if in<br>
haste, &ldquo;Dear Lady Betty, take care of your little sister.&rdquo; And so the<br>
crowd did as it were thrust me away from her, and that I was obliged<br>
unwillingly to take my leave.<br>
<br>
The hurry in such cases is immediately over, and the place clear as<br>
soon as the king is gone by; but as there is always a great running and<br>
clutter just as the king passes, so having dropped the two little<br>
ladies, and done my business with them without any miscarriage, I kept<br>
hurrying on among the crowd, as if I ran to see the king, and so I got<br>
before the crowd and kept so till I came to the end of the Mall, when<br>
the king going on towards the Horse Guards, I went forward to the<br>
passage, which went then through against the lower end of the<br>
Haymarket, and there I bestowed a coach upon myself, and made off, and<br>
I confess I have not yet been so good as my word, viz. to go and visit<br>
my Lady Betty.<br>
<br>
I was once of the mind to venture staying with Lady Betty till she<br>
missed the watch, and so have made a great outcry about it with her,<br>
and have got her into the coach, and put myself in the coach with her,<br>
and have gone home with her; for she appeared so fond of me, and so<br>
perfectly deceived by my so readily talking to her of all her relations<br>
and family, that I thought it was very easy to push the thing farther,<br>
and to have got at least the necklace of pearl; but when I considered<br>
that though the child would not perhaps have suspected me, other people<br>
might, and that if I was searched I should be discovered, I thought it<br>
was best to go off with what I had got, and be satisfied.<br>
<br>
I came accidentally afterwards to hear, that when the young lady missed<br>
her watch, she made a great outcry in the Park, and sent her footman up<br>
and down to see if he could find me out, she having described me so<br>
perfectly that he knew presently that it was the same person that had<br>
stood and talked so long with him, and asked him so many questions<br>
about them; but I gone far enough out of their reach before she could<br>
come at her footman to tell him the story.<br>
<br>
I made another adventure after this, of a nature different from all I<br>
had been concerned in yet, and this was at a gaming-house near Covent<br>
Garden.<br>
<br>
I saw several people go in and out; and I stood in the passage a good<br>
while with another woman with me, and seeing a gentleman go up that<br>
seemed to be of more than ordinary fashion, I said to him, &ldquo;Sir, pray<br>
don&rsquo;t they give women leave to go up?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and to<br>
play too, if they please.&rdquo; &ldquo;I mean so, sir,&rdquo; said I. And with that he<br>
said he would introduce me if I had a mind; so I followed him to the<br>
door, and he looking in, &ldquo;There, madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are the gamesters,<br>
if you have a mind to venture.&rdquo; I looked in and said to my comrade<br>
aloud, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s nothing but men; I won&rsquo;t venture among them.&rdquo; At which<br>
one of the gentlemen cried out, &ldquo;You need not be afraid, madam, here&rsquo;s<br>
none but fair gamesters; you are very welcome to come and set what you<br>
please.&rdquo; So I went a little nearer and looked on, and some of them<br>
brought me a chair, and I sat down and saw the box and dice go round<br>
apace; then I said to my comrade, &ldquo;The gentlemen play too high for us;<br>
come, let us go.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The people were all very civil, and one gentleman in particular<br>
encouraged me, and said, &ldquo;Come, madam, if you please to venture, if you<br>
dare trust me, I&rsquo;ll answer for it you shall have nothing put upon you<br>
here.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said I, smiling, &ldquo;I hope the gentlemen would not<br>
cheat a woman.&rdquo; But still I declined venturing, though I pulled out a<br>
purse with money in it, that they might see I did not want money.<br>
<br>
After I had sat a while, one gentleman said to me, jeering, &ldquo;Come,<br>
madam, I see you are afraid to venture for yourself; I always had good<br>
luck with the ladies, you shall set for me, if you won&rsquo;t set for<br>
yourself.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;Sir, I should be very loth to lose your money,&rdquo;<br>
though I added, &ldquo;I am pretty lucky too; but the gentlemen play so high,<br>
that I dare not indeed venture my own.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s ten guineas, madam; set them for me.&rdquo;<br>
So I took his money and set, himself looking on. I ran out nine of the<br>
guineas by one and two at a time, and then the box coming to the next<br>
man to me, my gentleman gave me ten guineas more, and made me set five<br>
of them at once, and the gentleman who had the box threw out, so there<br>
was five guineas of his money again. He was encouraged at this, and<br>
made me take the box, which was a bold venture. However, I held the box<br>
so long that I had gained him his whole money, and had a good handful<br>
of guineas in my lap, and which was the better luck, when I threw out,<br>
I threw but at one or two of those that had set me, and so went off<br>
easy.<br>
<br>
When I was come this length, I offered the gentleman all the gold, for<br>
it was his own; and so would have had him play for himself, pretending<br>
I did not understand the game well enough. He laughed, and said if I<br>
had but good luck, it was no matter whether I understood the game or<br>
no; but I should not leave off. However, he took out the fifteen<br>
guineas that he had put in at first, and bade me play with the rest. I<br>
would have told them to see how much I had got, but he said, &ldquo;No, no,<br>
don&rsquo;t tell them, I believe you are very honest, and &rsquo;tis bad luck to<br>
tell them&rdquo;; so I played on.<br>
<br>
I understood the game well enough, though I pretended I did not, and<br>
played cautiously. It was to keep a good stock in my lap, out of which<br>
I every now and then conveyed some into my pocket, but in such a<br>
manner, and at such convenient times, as I was sure he could not see<br>
it.<br>
<br>
I played a great while, and had very good luck for him; but the last<br>
time I held the box, they set me high, and I threw boldly at all; I<br>
held the box till I gained near fourscore guineas, but lost above half<br>
of it back in the last throw; so I got up, for I was afraid I should<br>
lose it all back again, and said to him, &ldquo;Pray come, sir, now, and take<br>
it and play for yourself; I think I have done pretty well for you.&rdquo; He<br>
would have had me play on, but it grew late, and I desired to be<br>
excused. When I gave it up to him, I told him I hoped he would give me<br>
leave to tell it now, that I might see what I had gained, and how lucky<br>
I had been for him; when I told them, there were threescore and three<br>
guineas. &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if it had not been for that unlucky throw, I<br>
had got you a hundred guineas.&rdquo; So I gave him all the money, but he<br>
would not take it till I had put my hand into it, and taken some for<br>
myself, and bid me please myself. I refused it, and was positive I<br>
would not take it myself; if he had a mind to anything of that kind, it<br>
should be all his own doings.<br>
<br>
The rest of the gentlemen seeing us striving cried, &ldquo;Give it her all&rdquo;;<br>
but I absolutely refused that. Then one of them said, &ldquo;D&mdash;n ye, Jack,<br>
halve it with her; don&rsquo;t you know you should be always upon even terms<br>
with the ladies.&rdquo; So, in short, he divided it with me, and I brought<br>
away thirty guineas, besides about forty-three which I had stole<br>
privately, which I was sorry for afterward, because he was so generous.<br>
<br>
Thus I brought home seventy-three guineas, and let my old governess see<br>
what good luck I had at play. However, it was her advice that I should<br>
not venture again, and I took her counsel, for I never went there any<br>
more; for I knew as well as she, if the itch of play came in, I might<br>
soon lose that, and all the rest of what I had got.<br>
<br>
Fortune had smiled upon me to that degree, and I had thriven so much,<br>
and my governess too, for she always had a share with me, that really<br>
the old gentlewoman began to talk of leaving off while we were well,<br>
and being satisfied with what we had got; but, I know not what fate<br>
guided me, I was as backward to it now as she was when I proposed it to<br>
her before, and so in an ill hour we gave over the thoughts of it for<br>
the present, and, in a word, I grew more hardened and audacious than<br>
ever, and the success I had made my name as famous as any thief of my<br>
sort ever had been at Newgate, and in the Old Bailey.<br>
<br>
I had sometime taken the liberty to play the same game over again,<br>
which is not according to practice, which however succeeded not amiss;<br>
but generally I took up new figures, and contrived to appear in new<br>
shapes every time I went abroad.<br>
<br>
It was not a rumbling time of the year, and the gentlemen being most of<br>
them gone out of town, Tunbridge, and Epsom, and such places were full<br>
of people. But the city was thin, and I thought our trade felt it a<br>
little, as well as other; so that at the latter end of the year I<br>
joined myself with a gang who usually go every year to Stourbridge<br>
Fair, and from thence to Bury Fair, in Suffolk. We promised ourselves<br>
great things there, but when I came to see how things were, I was weary<br>
of it presently; for except mere picking of pockets, there was little<br>
worth meddling with; neither, if a booty had been made, was it so easy<br>
carrying it off, nor was there such a variety of occasion for business<br>
in our way, as in London; all that I made of the whole journey was a<br>
gold watch at Bury Fair, and a small parcel of linen at Cambridge,<br>
which gave me an occasion to take leave of the place. It was on old<br>
bite, and I thought might do with a country shopkeeper, though in<br>
London it would not.<br>
<br>
I bought at a linen-draper&rsquo;s shop, not in the fair, but in the town of<br>
Cambridge, as much fine holland and other things as came to about seven<br>
pounds; when I had done, I bade them be sent to such an inn, where I<br>
had purposely taken up my being the same morning, as if I was to lodge<br>
there that night.<br>
<br>
I ordered the draper to send them home to me, about such an hour, to<br>
the inn where I lay, and I would pay him his money. At the time<br>
appointed the draper sends the goods, and I placed one of our gang at<br>
the chamber door, and when the innkeeper&rsquo;s maid brought the messenger<br>
to the door, who was a young fellow, an apprentice, almost a man, she<br>
tells him her mistress was asleep, but if he would leave the things and<br>
call in about an hour, I should be awake, and he might have the money.<br>
He left the parcel very readily, and goes his way, and in about half an<br>
hour my maid and I walked off, and that very evening I hired a horse,<br>
and a man to ride before me, and went to Newmarket, and from thence got<br>
my passage in a coach that was not quite full to St. Edmund&rsquo;s Bury,<br>
where, as I told you, I could make but little of my trade, only at a<br>
little country opera-house made a shift to carry off a gold watch from<br>
a lady&rsquo;s side, who was not only intolerably merry, but, as I thought, a<br>
little fuddled, which made my work much easier.<br>
<br>
I made off with this little booty to Ipswich, and from thence to<br>
Harwich, where I went into an inn, as if I had newly arrived from<br>
Holland, not doubting but I should make some purchase among the<br>
foreigners that came on shore there; but I found them generally empty<br>
of things of value, except what was in their portmanteaux and Dutch<br>
hampers, which were generally guarded by footmen; however, I fairly got<br>
one of their portmanteaux one evening out of the chamber where the<br>
gentleman lay, the footman being fast asleep on the bed, and I suppose<br>
very drunk.<br>
<br>
The room in which I lodged lay next to the Dutchman&rsquo;s, and having<br>
dragged the heavy thing with much ado out of the chamber into mine, I<br>
went out into the street, to see if I could find any possibility of<br>
carrying it off. I walked about a great while, but could see no<br>
probability either of getting out the thing, or of conveying away the<br>
goods that were in it if I had opened it, the town being so small, and<br>
I a perfect stranger in it; so I was returning with a resolution to<br>
carry it back again, and leave it where I found it. Just in that very<br>
moment I heard a man make a noise to some people to make haste, for the<br>
boat was going to put off, and the tide would be spent. I called to the<br>
fellow, &ldquo;What boat is it, friend,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that you belong to?&rdquo; &ldquo;The<br>
Ipswich wherry, madam,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;When do you go off?&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;This<br>
moment, madam,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;do you want to go thither?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I,<br>
&ldquo;if you can stay till I fetch my things.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are your things,<br>
madam?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;At such an inn,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go with you,<br>
madam,&rdquo; says he, very civilly, &ldquo;and bring them for you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come away,<br>
then,&rdquo; says I, and takes him with me.<br>
<br>
The people of the inn were in a great hurry, the packet-boat from<br>
Holland being just come in, and two coaches just come also with<br>
passengers from London, for another packet-boat that was going off for<br>
Holland, which coaches were to go back next day with the passengers<br>
that were just landed. In this hurry it was not much minded that I came<br>
to the bar and paid my reckoning, telling my landlady I had gotten my<br>
passage by sea in a wherry.<br>
<br>
These wherries are large vessels, with good accommodation for carrying<br>
passengers from Harwich to London; and though they are called wherries,<br>
which is a word used in the Thames for a small boat rowed with one or<br>
two men, yet these are vessels able to carry twenty passengers, and ten<br>
or fifteen tons of goods, and fitted to bear the sea. All this I had<br>
found out by inquiring the night before into the several ways of going<br>
to London.<br>
<br>
My landlady was very courteous, took my money for my reckoning, but was<br>
called away, all the house being in a hurry. So I left her, took the<br>
fellow up to my chamber, gave him the trunk, or portmanteau, for it was<br>
like a trunk, and wrapped it about with an old apron, and he went<br>
directly to his boat with it, and I after him, nobody asking us the<br>
least question about it; as for the drunken Dutch footman he was still<br>
asleep, and his master with other foreign gentlemen at supper, and very<br>
merry below, so I went clean off with it to Ipswich; and going in the<br>
night, the people of the house knew nothing but that I was gone to<br>
London by the Harwich wherry, as I had told my landlady.<br>
<br>
I was plagued at Ipswich with the custom-house officers, who stopped my<br>
trunk, as I called it, and would open and search it. I was willing, I<br>
told them, they should search it, but husband had the key, and he was<br>
not yet come from Harwich; this I said, that if upon searching it they<br>
should find all the things be such as properly belonged to a man rather<br>
than a woman, it should not seem strange to them. However, they being<br>
positive to open the trunk I consented to have it be broken open, that<br>
is to say, to have the lock taken off, which was not difficult.<br>
<br>
They found nothing for their turn, for the trunk had been searched<br>
before, but they discovered several things very much to my<br>
satisfaction, as particularly a parcel of money in French pistoles, and<br>
some Dutch ducatoons or rix-dollars, and the rest was chiefly two<br>
periwigs, wearing-linen, and razors, wash-balls, perfumes, and other<br>
useful things necessary for a gentleman, which all passed for my<br>
husband&rsquo;s, and so I was quit to them.<br>
<br>
It was now very early in the morning, and not light, and I knew not<br>
well what course to take; for I made no doubt but I should be pursued<br>
in the morning, and perhaps be taken with the things about me; so I<br>
resolved upon taking new measures. I went publicly to an inn in the<br>
town with my trunk, as I called it, and having taken the substance out,<br>
I did not think the lumber of it worth my concern; however, I gave it<br>
the landlady of the house with a charge to take great care of it, and<br>
lay it up safe till I should come again, and away I walked in to the<br>
street.<br>
<br>
When I was got into the town a great way from the inn, I met with an<br>
ancient woman who had just opened her door, and I fell into chat with<br>
her, and asked her a great many wild questions of things all remote to<br>
my purpose and design; but in my discourse I found by her how the town<br>
was situated, that I was in a street that went out towards Hadley, but<br>
that such a street went towards the water-side, such a street towards<br>
Colchester, and so the London road lay there.<br>
<br>
I had soon my ends of this old woman, for I only wanted to know which<br>
was the London road, and away I walked as fast as I could; not that I<br>
intended to go on foot, either to London or to Colchester, but I wanted<br>
to get quietly away from Ipswich.<br>
<br>
I walked about two or three miles, and then I met a plain countryman,<br>
who was busy about some husbandry work, I did not know what, and I<br>
asked him a great many questions first, not much to the purpose, but at<br>
last told him I was going for London, and the coach was full, and I<br>
could not get a passage, and asked him if he could tell me where to<br>
hire a horse that would carry double, and an honest man to ride before<br>
me to Colchester, that so I might get a place there in the coaches. The<br>
honest clown looked earnestly at me, and said nothing for above half a<br>
minute, when, scratching his poll, &ldquo;A horse, say you and to Colchester,<br>
to carry double? why yes, mistress, alack-a-day, you may have horses<br>
enough for money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, friend,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;that I take for granted; I<br>
don&rsquo;t expect it without money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, but, mistress,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;how<br>
much are you willing to give?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says I again, &ldquo;friend, I don&rsquo;t<br>
know what your rates are in the country here, for I am a stranger; but<br>
if you can get one for me, get it as cheap as you can, and I&rsquo;ll give<br>
you somewhat for your pains.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s honestly said too,&rdquo; says the countryman. &ldquo;Not so honest,<br>
neither,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;if thou knewest all.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, mistress,&rdquo;<br>
says he, &ldquo;I have a horse that will carry double, and I don&rsquo;t much care<br>
if I go myself with you,&rdquo; and the like. &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;well, I<br>
believe you are an honest man; if you will, I shall be glad of it; I&rsquo;ll<br>
pay you in reason.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, look ye, mistress,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be out<br>
of reason with you, then; if I carry you to Colchester, it will be<br>
worth five shillings for myself and my horse, for I shall hardly come<br>
back to-night.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
In short, I hired the honest man and his horse; but when we came to a<br>
town upon the road (I do not remember the name of it, but it stands<br>
upon a river), I pretended myself very ill, and I could go no farther<br>
that night but if he would stay there with me, because I was a<br>
stranger, I would pay him for himself and his horse with all my heart.<br>
<br>
This I did because I knew the Dutch gentlemen and their servants would<br>
be upon the road that day, either in the stagecoaches or riding post,<br>
and I did not know but the drunken fellow, or somebody else that might<br>
have seen me at Harwich, might see me again, and so I thought that in<br>
one day&rsquo;s stop they would be all gone by.<br>
<br>
We lay all that night there, and the next morning it was not very early<br>
when I set out, so that it was near ten o&rsquo;clock by the time I got to<br>
Colchester. It was no little pleasure that I saw the town where I had<br>
so many pleasant days, and I made many inquiries after the good old<br>
friends I had once had there, but could make little out; they were all<br>
dead or removed. The young ladies had been all married or gone to<br>
London; the old gentleman and the old lady that had been my early<br>
benefactress all dead; and which troubled me most, the young gentleman<br>
my first lover, and afterwards my brother-in-law, was dead; but two<br>
sons, men grown, were left of him, but they too were transplanted to<br>
London.<br>
<br>
I dismissed my old man here, and stayed incognito for three or four<br>
days in Colchester, and then took a passage in a waggon, because I<br>
would not venture being seen in the Harwich coaches. But I needed not<br>
have used so much caution, for there was nobody in Harwich but the<br>
woman of the house could have known me; nor was it rational to think<br>
that she, considering the hurry she was in, and that she never saw me<br>
but once, and that by candlelight, should have ever discovered me.<br>
<br>
I was now returned to London, and though by the accident of the last<br>
adventure I got something considerable, yet I was not fond of any more<br>
country rambles, nor should I have ventured abroad again if I had<br>
carried the trade on to the end of my days. I gave my governess a<br>
history of my travels; she liked the Harwich journey well enough, and<br>
in discoursing of these things between ourselves she observed, that a<br>
thief being a creature that watches the advantages of other people&rsquo;s<br>
mistakes, &rsquo;tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and<br>
industrious many opportunities must happen, and therefore she thought<br>
that one so exquisitely keen in the trade as I was, would scarce fail<br>
of something extraordinary wherever I went.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, every branch of my story, if duly considered, may be<br>
useful to honest people, and afford a due caution to people of some<br>
sort or other to guard against the like surprises, and to have their<br>
eyes about them when they have to do with strangers of any kind, for<br>
&rsquo;tis very seldom that some snare or other is not in their way. The<br>
moral, indeed, of all my history is left to be gathered by the senses<br>
and judgment of the reader; I am not qualified to preach to them. Let<br>
the experience of one creature completely wicked, and completely<br>
miserable, be a storehouse of useful warning to those that read.<br>
<br>
I am drawing now towards a new variety of the scenes of life. Upon my<br>
return, being hardened by a long race of crime, and success<br>
unparalleled, at least in the reach of my own knowledge, I had, as I<br>
have said, no thoughts of laying down a trade which, if I was to judge<br>
by the example of other, must, however, end at last in misery and<br>
sorrow.<br>
<br>
It was on the Christmas day following, in the evening, that, to finish<br>
a long train of wickedness, I went abroad to see what might offer in my<br>
way; when going by a working silversmith&rsquo;s in Foster Lane, I saw a<br>
tempting bait indeed, and not be resisted by one of my occupation, for<br>
the shop had nobody in it, as I could see, and a great deal of loose<br>
plate lay in the window, and at the seat of the man, who usually, as I<br>
suppose, worked at one side of the shop.<br>
<br>
I went boldly in, and was just going to lay my hand upon a piece of<br>
plate, and might have done it, and carried it clear off, for any care<br>
that the men who belonged to the shop had taken of it; but an officious<br>
fellow in a house, not a shop, on the other side of the way, seeing me<br>
go in, and observing that there was nobody in the shop, comes running<br>
over the street, and into the shop, and without asking me what I was,<br>
or who, seizes upon me, an cries out for the people of the house.<br>
<br>
I had not, as I said above, touched anything in the shop, and seeing a<br>
glimpse of somebody running over to the shop, I had so much presence of<br>
mind as to knock very hard with my foot on the floor of the house, and<br>
was just calling out too, when the fellow laid hands on me.<br>
<br>
However, as I had always most courage when I was in most danger, so<br>
when the fellow laid hands on me, I stood very high upon it, that I<br>
came in to buy half a dozen of silver spoons; and to my good fortune,<br>
it was a silversmith&rsquo;s that sold plate, as well as worked plate for<br>
other shops. The fellow laughed at that part, and put such a value upon<br>
the service that he had done his neighbour, that he would have it be<br>
that I came not to buy, but to steal; and raising a great crowd. I said<br>
to the master of the shop, who by this time was fetched home from some<br>
neighbouring place, that it was in vain to make noise, and enter into<br>
talk there of the case; the fellow had insisted that I came to steal,<br>
and he must prove it, and I desired we might go before a magistrate<br>
without any more words; for I began to see I should be too hard for the<br>
man that had seized me.<br>
<br>
The master and mistress of the shop were really not so violent as the<br>
man from t&rsquo;other side of the way; and the man said, &ldquo;Mistress, you<br>
might come into the shop with a good design for aught I know, but it<br>
seemed a dangerous thing for you to come into such a shop as mine is,<br>
when you see nobody there; and I cannot do justice to my neighbour, who<br>
was so kind to me, as not to acknowledge he had reason on his side;<br>
though, upon the whole, I do not find you attempted to take anything,<br>
and I really know not what to do in it.&rdquo; I pressed him to go before a<br>
magistrate with me, and if anything could be proved on me that was like<br>
a design of robbery, I should willingly submit, but if not, I expected<br>
reparation.<br>
<br>
Just while we were in this debate, and a crowd of people gathered about<br>
the door, came by Sir T. B., an alderman of the city, and justice of<br>
the peace, and the goldsmith hearing of it, goes out, and entreated his<br>
worship to come in and decide the case.<br>
<br>
Give the goldsmith his due, he told his story with a great deal of<br>
justice and moderation, and the fellow that had come over, and seized<br>
upon me, told his with as much heat and foolish passion, which did me<br>
good still, rather than harm. It came then to my turn to speak, and I<br>
told his worship that I was a stranger in London, being newly come out<br>
of the north; that I lodged in such a place, that I was passing this<br>
street, and went into the goldsmith&rsquo;s shop to buy half a dozen of<br>
spoons. By great luck I had an old silver spoon in my pocket, which I<br>
pulled out, and told him I had carried that spoon to match it with half<br>
a dozen of new ones, that it might match some I had in the country.<br>
<br>
That seeing nobody I the shop, I knocked with my foot very hard to make<br>
the people hear, and had also called aloud with my voice; &rsquo;tis true,<br>
there was loose plate in the shop, but that nobody could say I had<br>
touched any of it, or gone near it; that a fellow came running into the<br>
shop out of the street, and laid hands on me in a furious manner, in<br>
the very moments while I was calling for the people of the house; that<br>
if he had really had a mind to have done his neighbour any service, he<br>
should have stood at a distance, and silently watched to see whether I<br>
had touched anything or no, and then have clapped in upon me, and taken<br>
me in the fact. &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; says Mr. Alderman, and turning to<br>
the fellow that stopped me, he asked him if it was true that I knocked<br>
with my foot? He said, yes, I had knocked, but that might be because of<br>
his coming. &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says the alderman, taking him short, &ldquo;now you<br>
contradict yourself, for just now you said she was in the shop with her<br>
back to you, and did not see you till you came upon her.&rdquo; Now it was<br>
true that my back was partly to the street, but yet as my business was<br>
of a kind that required me to have my eyes every way, so I really had a<br>
glance of him running over, as I said before, though he did not<br>
perceive it.<br>
<br>
After a full hearing, the alderman gave it as his opinion that his<br>
neighbour was under a mistake, and that I was innocent, and the<br>
goldsmith acquiesced in it too, and his wife, and so I was dismissed;<br>
but as I was going to depart, Mr. Alderman said, &ldquo;But hold, madam, if<br>
you were designing to buy spoons, I hope you will not let my friend<br>
here lose his customer by the mistake.&rdquo; I readily answered, &ldquo;No, sir,<br>
I&rsquo;ll buy the spoons still, if he can match my odd spoon, which I<br>
brought for a pattern&rdquo;; and the goldsmith showed me some of the very<br>
same fashion. So he weighed the spoons, and they came to<br>
five-and-thirty shillings, so I pulls out my purse to pay him, in which<br>
I had near twenty guineas, for I never went without such a sum about<br>
me, whatever might happen, and I found it of use at other times as well<br>
as now.<br>
<br>
When Mr. Alderman saw my money, he said, &ldquo;Well, madam, now I am<br>
satisfied you were wronged, and it was for this reason that I moved you<br>
should buy the spoons, and stayed till you had bought them, for if you<br>
had not had money to pay for them, I should have suspected that you did<br>
not come into the shop with an intent to buy, for indeed the sort of<br>
people who come upon these designs that you have been charged with, are<br>
seldom troubled with much gold in their pockets, as I see you are.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I smiled, and told his worship, that then I owed something of his<br>
favour to my money, but I hoped he saw reason also in the justice he<br>
had done me before. He said, yes, he had, but this had confirmed his<br>
opinion, and he was fully satisfied now of my having been injured. So I<br>
came off with flying colours, though from an affair in which I was at<br>
the very brink of destruction.<br>
<br>
It was but three days after this, that not at all made cautious by my<br>
former danger, as I used to be, and still pursuing the art which I had<br>
so long been employed in, I ventured into a house where I saw the doors<br>
open, and furnished myself, as I though verily without being perceived,<br>
with two pieces of flowered silks, such as they call brocaded silk,<br>
very rich. It was not a mercer&rsquo;s shop, nor a warehouse of a mercer, but<br>
looked like a private dwelling-house, and was, it seems, inhabited by a<br>
man that sold goods for the weavers to the mercers, like a broker or<br>
factor.<br>
<br>
That I may make short of this black part of this story, I was attacked<br>
by two wenches that came open-mouthed at me just as I was going out at<br>
the door, and one of them pulled me back into the room, while the other<br>
shut the door upon me. I would have given them good words, but there<br>
was no room for it, two fiery dragons could not have been more furious<br>
than they were; they tore my clothes, bullied and roared as if they<br>
would have murdered me; the mistress of the house came next, and then<br>
the master, and all outrageous, for a while especially.<br>
<br>
I gave the master very good words, told him the door was open, and<br>
things were a temptation to me, that I was poor and distressed, and<br>
poverty was when many could not resist, and begged him with tears to<br>
have pity on me. The mistress of the house was moved with compassion,<br>
and inclined to have let me go, and had almost persuaded her husband to<br>
it also, but the saucy wenches were run, even before they were sent,<br>
and had fetched a constable, and then the master said he could not go<br>
back, I must go before a justice, and answered his wife that he might<br>
come into trouble himself if he should let me go.<br>
<br>
The sight of the constable, indeed, struck me with terror, and I<br>
thought I should have sunk into the ground. I fell into faintings, and<br>
indeed the people themselves thought I would have died, when the woman<br>
argued again for me, and entreated her husband, seeing they had lost<br>
nothing, to let me go. I offered him to pay for the two pieces,<br>
whatever the value was, though I had not got them, and argued that as<br>
he had his goods, and had really lost nothing, it would be cruel to<br>
pursue me to death, and have my blood for the bare attempt of taking<br>
them. I put the constable in mind that I had broke no doors, nor<br>
carried anything away; and when I came to the justice, and pleaded<br>
there that I had neither broken anything to get in, nor carried<br>
anything out, the justice was inclined to have released me; but the<br>
first saucy jade that stopped me, affirming that I was going out with<br>
the goods, but that she stopped me and pulled me back as I was upon the<br>
threshold, the justice upon that point committed me, and I was carried<br>
to Newgate. That horrid place! my very blood chills at the mention of<br>
its name; the place where so many of my comrades had been locked up,<br>
and from whence they went to the fatal tree; the place where my mother<br>
suffered so deeply, where I was brought into the world, and from whence<br>
I expected no redemption but by an infamous death: to conclude, the<br>
place that had so long expected me, and which with so much art and<br>
success I had so long avoided.<br>
<br>
I was not fixed indeed; &rsquo;tis impossible to describe the terror of my<br>
mind, when I was first brought in, and when I looked around upon all<br>
the horrors of that dismal place. I looked on myself as lost, and that<br>
I had nothing to think of but of going out of the world, and that with<br>
the utmost infamy: the hellish noise, the roaring, swearing, and<br>
clamour, the stench and nastiness, and all the dreadful crowd of<br>
afflicting things that I saw there, joined together to make the place<br>
seem an emblem of hell itself, and a kind of an entrance into it.<br>
<br>
Now I reproached myself with the many hints I had had, as I have<br>
mentioned above, from my own reason, from the sense of my good<br>
circumstances, and of the many dangers I had escaped, to leave off<br>
while I was well, and how I had withstood them all, and hardened my<br>
thoughts against all fear. It seemed to me that I was hurried on by an<br>
inevitable and unseen fate to this day of misery, and that now I was to<br>
expiate all my offences at the gallows; that I was now to give<br>
satisfaction to justice with my blood, and that I was come to the last<br>
hour of my life and of my wickedness together. These things poured<br>
themselves in upon my thoughts in a confused manner, and left me<br>
overwhelmed with melancholy and despair.<br>
<br>
Them I repented heartily of all my life past, but that repentance<br>
yielded me no satisfaction, no peace, no, not in the least, because, as<br>
I said to myself, it was repenting after the power of further sinning<br>
was taken away. I seemed not to mourn that I had committed such crimes,<br>
and for the fact as it was an offence against God and my neighbour, but<br>
I mourned that I was to be punished for it. I was a penitent, as I<br>
thought, not that I had sinned, but that I was to suffer, and this took<br>
away all the comfort, and even the hope of my repentance in my own<br>
thoughts.<br>
<br>
I got no sleep for several nights or days after I came into that<br>
wretched place, and glad I would have been for some time to have died<br>
there, though I did not consider dying as it ought to be considered<br>
neither; indeed, nothing could be filled with more horror to my<br>
imagination than the very place, nothing was more odious to me than the<br>
company that was there. Oh! if I had but been sent to any place in the<br>
world, and not to Newgate, I should have thought myself happy.<br>
<br>
In the next place, how did the hardened wretches that were there before<br>
me triumph over me! What! Mrs. Flanders come to Newgate at last? What!<br>
Mrs. Mary, Mrs. Molly, and after that plain Moll Flanders? They thought<br>
the devil had helped me, they said, that I had reigned so long; they<br>
expected me there many years ago, and was I come at last? Then they<br>
flouted me with my dejections, welcomed me to the place, wished me joy,<br>
bid me have a good heart, not to be cast down, things might not be so<br>
bad as I feared, and the like; then called for brandy, and drank to me,<br>
but put it all up to my score, for they told me I was but just come to<br>
the college, as they called it, and sure I had money in my pocket,<br>
though they had none.<br>
<br>
I asked one of this crew how long she had been there. She said four<br>
months. I asked her how the place looked to her when she first came<br>
into it. &ldquo;Just as it did now to you,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;dreadful and<br>
frightful&rdquo;; that she thought she was in hell; &ldquo;and I believe so still,&rdquo;<br>
adds she, &ldquo;but it is natural to me now, I don&rsquo;t disturb myself about<br>
it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you are in no danger of what is to follow?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;for you are mistaken there, I assure you, for I am<br>
under sentence, only I pleaded my belly, but I am no more with child<br>
than the judge that tried me, and I expect to be called down next<br>
sessions.&rdquo; This &ldquo;calling down&rdquo; is calling down to their former<br>
judgment, when a woman has been respited for her belly, but proves not<br>
to be with child, or if she has been with child, and has been brought<br>
to bed. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;are you thus easy?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t<br>
help myself; what signifies being sad? If I am hanged, there&rsquo;s an end<br>
of me,&rdquo; says she; and away she turns dancing, and sings as she goes the<br>
following piece of Newgate wit&mdash;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;If I swing by the string,<br>
I shall hear the bell ring,<br>
And then there&rsquo;s an end of poor Jenny.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I mention this because it would be worth the observation of any<br>
prisoner, who shall hereafter fall into the same misfortune, and come<br>
to that dreadful place of Newgate, how time, necessity, and conversing<br>
with the wretches that are there familiarizes the place to them; how at<br>
last they become reconciled to that which at first was the greatest<br>
dread upon their spirits in the world, and are as impudently cheerful<br>
and merry in their misery as they were when out of it.<br>
<br>
I cannot say, as some do, this devil is not so black as he is painted;<br>
for indeed no colours can represent the place to the life, not any soul<br>
conceive aright of it but those who have been sufferers there. But how<br>
hell should become by degree so natural, and not only tolerable, but<br>
even agreeable, is a thing unintelligible but by those who have<br>
experienced it, as I have.<br>
<br>
The same night that I was sent to Newgate, I sent the news of it to my<br>
old governess, who was surprised at it, you may be sure, and spent the<br>
night almost as ill out of Newgate, as I did in it.<br>
<br>
The next morning she came to see me; she did what she could to comfort<br>
me, but she saw that was to no purpose; however, as she said, to sink<br>
under the weight was but to increase the weight; she immediately<br>
applied herself to all the proper methods to prevent the effects of it,<br>
which we feared, and first she found out the two fiery jades that had<br>
surprised me. She tampered with them, offered them money, and, in a<br>
word, tried all imaginable ways to prevent a prosecution; she offered<br>
one of the wenches &pound;100 to go away from her mistress, and not to appear<br>
against me, but she was so resolute, that though she was but a servant<br>
maid at &pound;3 a year wages or thereabouts, she refused it, and would have<br>
refused it, as my governess said she believed, if she had offered her<br>
&pound;500. Then she attacked the other maid; she was not so hard-hearted in<br>
appearance as the other, and sometimes seemed inclined to be merciful;<br>
but the first wench kept her up, and changed her mind, and would not so<br>
much as let my governess talk with her, but threatened to have her up<br>
for tampering with the evidence.<br>
<br>
Then she applied to the master, that is to say, the man whose goods had<br>
been stolen, and particularly to his wife, who, as I told you, was<br>
inclined at first to have some compassion for me; she found the woman<br>
the same still, but the man alleged he was bound by the justice that<br>
committed me, to prosecute, and that he should forfeit his<br>
recognisance.<br>
<br>
My governess offered to find friends that should get his recognisances<br>
off of the file, as they call it, and that he should not suffer; but it<br>
was not possible to convince him that could be done, or that he could<br>
be safe any way in the world but by appearing against me; so I was to<br>
have three witnesses of fact against me, the master and his two maids;<br>
that is to say, I was as certain to be cast for my life as I was<br>
certain that I was alive, and I had nothing to do but to think of<br>
dying, and prepare for it. I had but a sad foundation to build upon, as<br>
I said before, for all my repentance appeared to me to be only the<br>
effect of my fear of death, not a sincere regret for the wicked life<br>
that I had lived, and which had brought this misery upon me, for the<br>
offending my Creator, who was now suddenly to be my judge.<br>
<br>
I lived many days here under the utmost horror of soul; I had death, as<br>
it were, in view, and thought of nothing night and day, but of gibbets<br>
and halters, evil spirits and devils; it is not to be expressed by<br>
words how I was harassed, between the dreadful apprehensions of death<br>
and the terror of my conscience reproaching me with my past horrible<br>
life.<br>
<br>
The ordinary of Newgate came to me, and talked a little in his way, but<br>
all his divinity ran upon confessing my crime, as he called it (though<br>
he knew not what I was in for), making a full discovery, and the like,<br>
without which he told me God would never forgive me; and he said so<br>
little to the purpose, that I had no manner of consolation from him;<br>
and then to observe the poor creature preaching confession and<br>
repentance to me in the morning, and find him drunk with brandy and<br>
spirits by noon, this had something in it so shocking, that I began to<br>
nauseate the man more than his work, and his work too by degrees, for<br>
the sake of the man; so that I desired him to trouble me no more.<br>
<br>
I know not how it was, but by the indefatigable application of my<br>
diligent governess I had no bill preferred against me the first<br>
sessions, I mean to the grand jury, at Guildhall; so I had another<br>
month or five weeks before me, and without doubt this ought to have<br>
been accepted by me, as so much time given me for reflection upon what<br>
was past, and preparation for what was to come; or, in a word, I ought<br>
to have esteemed it as a space given me for repentance, and have<br>
employed it as such, but it was not in me. I was sorry (as before) for<br>
being in Newgate, but had very few signs of repentance about me.<br>
<br>
On the contrary, like the waters in the cavities and hollows of<br>
mountains, which petrify and turn into stone whatever they are suffered<br>
to drop on, so the continual conversing with such a crew of hell-hounds<br>
as I was, had the same common operation upon me as upon other people. I<br>
degenerated into stone; I turned first stupid and senseless, then<br>
brutish and thoughtless, and at last raving mad as any of them were;<br>
and, in short, I became as naturally pleased and easy with the place,<br>
as if indeed I had been born there.<br>
<br>
It is scarce possible to imagine that our natures should be capable of<br>
so much degeneracy, as to make that pleasant and agreeable that in<br>
itself is the most complete misery. Here was a circumstance that I<br>
think it is scarce possible to mention a worse: I was as exquisitely<br>
miserable as, speaking of common cases, it was possible for any one to<br>
be that had life and health, and money to help them, as I had.<br>
<br>
I had weight of guilt upon me enough to sink any creature who had the<br>
least power of reflection left, and had any sense upon them of the<br>
happiness of this life, of the misery of another; then I had at first<br>
remorse indeed, but no repentance; I had now neither remorse nor<br>
repentance. I had a crime charged on me, the punishment of which was<br>
death by our law; the proof so evident, that there was no room for me<br>
so much as to plead not guilty. I had the name of an old offender, so<br>
that I had nothing to expect but death in a few weeks&rsquo; time, neither<br>
had I myself any thoughts of escaping; and yet a certain strange<br>
lethargy of soul possessed me. I had no trouble, no apprehensions, no<br>
sorrow about me, the first surprise was gone; I was, I may well say, I<br>
know not how; my senses, my reason, nay, my conscience, were all<br>
asleep; my course of life for forty years had been a horrid<br>
complication of wickedness, whoredom, adultery, incest, lying, theft;<br>
and, in a word, everything but murder and treason had been my practice<br>
from the age of eighteen, or thereabouts, to three-score; and now I was<br>
engulfed in the misery of punishment, and had an infamous death just at<br>
the door, and yet I had no sense of my condition, no thought of heaven<br>
or hell at least, that went any farther than a bare flying touch, like<br>
the stitch or pain that gives a hint and goes off. I neither had a<br>
heart to ask God&rsquo;s mercy, nor indeed to think of it. And in this, I<br>
think, I have given a brief description of the completest misery on<br>
earth.<br>
<br>
All my terrifying thoughts were past, the horrors of the place were<br>
become familiar, and I felt no more uneasiness at the noise and<br>
clamours of the prison, than they did who made that noise; in a word, I<br>
was become a mere Newgate-bird, as wicked and as outrageous as any of<br>
them; nay, I scarce retained the habit and custom of good breeding and<br>
manners, which all along till now ran through my conversation; so<br>
thorough a degeneracy had possessed me, that I was no more the same<br>
thing that I had been, than if I had never been otherwise than what I<br>
was now.<br>
<br>
In the middle of this hardened part of my life I had another sudden<br>
surprise, which called me back a little to that thing called sorrow,<br>
which indeed I began to be past the sense of before. They told me one<br>
night that there was brought into the prison late the night before<br>
three highwaymen, who had committed robbery somewhere on the road to<br>
Windsor, Hounslow Heath, I think it was, and were pursued to Uxbridge<br>
by the country, and were taken there after a gallant resistance, in<br>
which I know not how many of the country people were wounded, and some<br>
killed.<br>
<br>
It is not to be wondered that we prisoners were all desirous enough to<br>
see these brave, topping gentlemen, that were talked up to be such as<br>
their fellows had not been known, and especially because it was said<br>
they would in the morning be removed into the press-yard, having given<br>
money to the head master of the prison, to be allowed the liberty of<br>
that better part of the prison. So we that were women placed ourselves<br>
in the way, that we would be sure to see them; but nothing could<br>
express the amazement and surprise I was in, when the very first man<br>
that came out I knew to be my Lancashire husband, the same who lived so<br>
well at Dunstable, and the same who I afterwards saw at Brickhill, when<br>
I was married to my last husband, as has been related.<br>
<br>
I was struck dumb at the sight, and knew neither what to say nor what<br>
to do; he did not know me, and that was all the present relief I had. I<br>
quitted my company, and retired as much as that dreadful place suffers<br>
anybody to retire, and I cried vehemently for a great while. &ldquo;Dreadful<br>
creature that I am,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how many poor people have I made<br>
miserable? How many desperate wretches have I sent to the devil?&rdquo; He<br>
had told me at Chester he was ruined by that match, and that his<br>
fortunes were made desperate on my account; for that thinking I had<br>
been a fortune, he was run into debt more than he was able to pay, and<br>
that he knew not what course to take; that he would go into the army<br>
and carry a musket, or buy a horse and take a tour, as he called it;<br>
and though I never told him that I was a fortune, and so did not<br>
actually deceive him myself, yet I did encourage the having it thought<br>
that I was so, and by that means I was the occasion originally of his<br>
mischief.<br>
<br>
The surprise of the thing only struck deeper into my thoughts, and gave<br>
me stronger reflections than all that had befallen me before. I grieved<br>
day and night for him, and the more for that they told me he was the<br>
captain of the gang, and that he had committed so many robberies, that<br>
Hind, or Whitney, or the Golden Farmer were fools to him; that he would<br>
surely be hanged if there were no more men left in the country he was<br>
born in; and that there would abundance of people come in against him.<br>
<br>
I was overwhelmed with grief for him; my own case gave me no<br>
disturbance compared to this, and I loaded myself with reproaches on<br>
his account. I bewailed his misfortunes, and the ruin he was now come<br>
to, at such a rate, that I relished nothing now as I did before, and<br>
the first reflections I made upon the horrid, detestable life I had<br>
lived began to return upon me, and as these things returned, my<br>
abhorrence of the place I was in, and of the way of living in it,<br>
returned also; in a word, I was perfectly changed, and become another<br>
body.<br>
<br>
While I was under these influences of sorrow for him, came notice to me<br>
that the next sessions approaching there would be a bill preferred to<br>
the grand jury against me, and that I should be certainly tried for my<br>
life at the Old Bailey. My temper was touched before, the hardened,<br>
wretched boldness of spirit which I had acquired abated, and conscious<br>
in the prison, guilt began to flow in upon my mind. In short, I began<br>
to think, and to think is one real advance from hell to heaven. All<br>
that hellish, hardened state and temper of soul, which I have said so<br>
much of before, is but a deprivation of thought; he that is restored to<br>
his power of thinking, is restored to himself.<br>
<br>
As soon as I began, I say, to think, the first think that occurred to<br>
me broke out thus: &ldquo;Lord! what will become of me? I shall certainly<br>
die! I shall be cast, to be sure, and there is nothing beyond that but<br>
death! I have no friends; what shall I do? I shall be certainly cast!<br>
Lord, have mercy upon me! What will become of me?&rdquo; This was a sad<br>
thought, you will say, to be the first, after so long a time, that had<br>
started into my soul of that kind, and yet even this was nothing but<br>
fright at what was to come; there was not a word of sincere repentance<br>
in it all. However, I was indeed dreadfully dejected, and disconsolate<br>
to the last degree; and as I had no friend in the world to communicate<br>
my distressed thoughts to, it lay so heavy upon me, that it threw me<br>
into fits and swoonings several times a day. I sent for my old<br>
governess, and she, give her her due, acted the part of a true friend.<br>
She left no stone unturned to prevent the grand jury finding the bill.<br>
She sought out one or two of the jurymen, talked with them, and<br>
endeavoured to possess them with favourable dispositions, on account<br>
that nothing was taken away, and no house broken, etc.; but all would<br>
not do, they were over-ruled by the rest; the two wenches swore home to<br>
the fact, and the jury found the bill against me for robbery and<br>
house-breaking, that is, for felony and burglary.<br>
<br>
I sunk down when they brought me news of it, and after I came to myself<br>
again, I thought I should have died with the weight of it. My governess<br>
acted a true mother to me; she pitied me, she cried with me, and for<br>
me, but she could not help me; and to add to the terror of it, &rsquo;twas<br>
the discourse all over the house that I should die for it. I could hear<br>
them talk it among themselves very often, and see them shake their<br>
heads and say they were sorry for it, and the like, as is usual in the<br>
place. But still nobody came to tell me their thoughts, till at last<br>
one of the keepers came to me privately, and said with a sigh, &ldquo;Well,<br>
Mrs. Flanders, you will be tried on Friday&rdquo; (.);<br>
&ldquo;what do you intend to do?&rdquo; I turned as white as a clout, and said,<br>
&ldquo;God knows what I shall do; for my part, I know not what to do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;<br>
says he, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t flatter you, I would have you prepare for death, for<br>
I doubt you will be cast; and as they say you are an old offender, I<br>
doubt you will find but little mercy. They say,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;your case<br>
is very plain, and that the witnesses swear so home against you, there<br>
will be no standing it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was a stab into the very vitals of one under such a burthen as I<br>
was oppressed with before, and I could not speak to him a word, good or<br>
bad, for a great while; but at last I burst out into tears, and said to<br>
him, &ldquo;Lord! Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, what must I do?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do!&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;send for the<br>
ordinary; send for a minister and talk with him; for, indeed, Mrs.<br>
Flanders, unless you have very good friends, you are no woman for this<br>
world.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
This was plain dealing indeed, but it was very harsh to me, at least I<br>
thought it so. He left me in the greatest confusion imaginable, and all<br>
that night I lay awake. And now I began to say my prayers, which I had<br>
scarce done before since my last husband&rsquo;s death, or from a little<br>
while after. And truly I may well call it saying my prayers, for I was<br>
in such a confusion, and had such horror upon my mind, that though I<br>
cried, and repeated several times the ordinary expression of &ldquo;Lord,<br>
have mercy upon me!&rdquo; I never brought myself to any sense of my being a<br>
miserable sinner, as indeed I was, and of confessing my sins to God,<br>
and begging pardon for the sake of Jesus Christ. I was overwhelmed with<br>
the sense of my condition, being tried for my life, and being sure to<br>
be condemned, and then I was as sure to be executed, and on this<br>
account I cried out all night, &ldquo;Lord, what will become of me? Lord!<br>
what shall I do? Lord! I shall be hanged! Lord, have mercy upon me!&rdquo;<br>
and the like.<br>
<br>
My poor afflicted governess was now as much concerned as I, and a great<br>
deal more truly penitent, though she had no prospect of being brought<br>
to trial and sentence. Not but that she deserved it as much as I, and<br>
so she said herself; but she had not done anything herself for many<br>
years, other than receiving what I and others stole, and encouraging us<br>
to steal it. But she cried, and took on like a distracted body,<br>
wringing her hands, and crying out that she was undone, that she<br>
believed there was a curse from heaven upon her, that she should be<br>
damned, that she had been the destruction of all her friends, that she<br>
had brought such a one, and such a one, and such a one to the gallows;<br>
and there she reckoned up ten or eleven people, some of which I have<br>
given account of, that came to untimely ends; and that now she was the<br>
occasion of my ruin, for she had persuaded me to go on, when I would<br>
have left off. I interrupted her there. &ldquo;No, mother, no,&rdquo; said I,<br>
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t speak of that, for you would have had me left off when I got the<br>
mercer&rsquo;s money again, and when I came home from Harwich, and I would<br>
not hearken to you; therefore you have not been to blame; it is I only<br>
have ruined myself, I have brought myself to this misery&rdquo;; and thus we<br>
spent many hours together.<br>
<br>
Well, there was no remedy; the prosecution went on, and on the Thursday<br>
I was carried down to the sessions-house, where I was arraigned, as<br>
they called it, and the next day I was appointed to be tried. At the<br>
arraignment I pleaded &ldquo;Not guilty,&rdquo; and well I might, for I was<br>
indicted for felony and burglary; that is, for feloniously stealing two<br>
pieces of brocaded silk, value &pound;46, the goods of Anthony Johnson, and<br>
for breaking open his doors; whereas I knew very well they could not<br>
pretend to prove I had broken up the doors, or so much as lifted up a<br>
latch.<br>
<br>
On the Friday I was brought to my trial. I had exhausted my spirits<br>
with crying for two or three days before, so that I slept better the<br>
Thursday night than I expected, and had more courage for my trial than<br>
indeed I thought possible for me to have.<br>
<br>
When the trial began, the indictment was read, I would have spoke, but<br>
they told me the witnesses must be heard first, and then I should have<br>
time to be heard. The witnesses were the two wenches, a couple of<br>
hard-mouthed jades indeed, for though the thing was truth in the main,<br>
yet they aggravated it to the utmost extremity, and swore I had the<br>
goods wholly in my possession, that I had hid them among my clothes,<br>
that I was going off with them, that I had one foot over the threshold<br>
when they discovered themselves, and then I put t&rsquo; other over, so that<br>
I was quite out of the house in the street with the goods before they<br>
took hold of me, and then they seized me, and brought me back again,<br>
and they took the goods upon me. The fact in general was all true, but<br>
I believe, and insisted upon it, that they stopped me before I had set<br>
my foot clear of the threshold of the house. But that did not argue<br>
much, for certain it was that I had taken the goods, and I was bringing<br>
them away, if I had not been taken.<br>
<br>
But I pleaded that I had stole nothing, they had lost nothing, that the<br>
door was open, and I went in, seeing the goods lie there, and with<br>
design to buy. If, seeing nobody in the house, I had taken any of them<br>
up in my hand it could not be concluded that I intended to steal them,<br>
for that I never carried them farther than the door to look on them<br>
with the better light.<br>
<br>
The Court would not allow that by any means, and made a kind of a jest<br>
of my intending to buy the goods, that being no shop for the selling of<br>
anything, and as to carrying them to the door to look at them, the<br>
maids made their impudent mocks upon that, and spent their wit upon it<br>
very much; told the Court I had looked at them sufficiently, and<br>
approved them very well, for I had packed them up under my clothes, and<br>
was a-going with them.<br>
<br>
In short, I was found guilty of felony, but acquitted of the burglary,<br>
which was but small comfort to me, the first bringing me to a sentence<br>
of death, and the last would have done no more. The next day I was<br>
carried down to receive the dreadful sentence, and when they came to<br>
ask me what I had to say why sentence should not pass, I stood mute a<br>
while, but somebody that stood behind me prompted me aloud to speak to<br>
the judges, for that they could represent things favourably for me.<br>
This encouraged me to speak, and I told them I had nothing to say to<br>
stop the sentence, but that I had much to say to bespeak the mercy of<br>
the Court; that I hoped they would allow something in such a case for<br>
the circumstances of it; that I had broken no doors, had carried<br>
nothing off; that nobody had lost anything; that the person whose goods<br>
they were was pleased to say he desired mercy might be shown (which<br>
indeed he very honestly did); that, at the worst, it was the first<br>
offence, and that I had never been before any court of justice before;<br>
and, in a word, I spoke with more courage that I thought I could have<br>
done, and in such a moving tone, and though with tears, yet not so many<br>
tears as to obstruct my speech, that I could see it moved others to<br>
tears that heard me.<br>
<br>
The judges sat grave and mute, gave me an easy hearing, and time to say<br>
all that I would, but, saying neither Yes nor No to it, pronounced the<br>
sentence of death upon me, a sentence that was to me like death itself,<br>
which, after it was read, confounded me. I had no more spirit left in<br>
me, I had no tongue to speak, or eyes to look up either to God or man.<br>
<br>
My poor governess was utterly disconsolate, and she that was my<br>
comforter before, wanted comfort now herself; and sometimes mourning,<br>
sometimes raging, was as much out of herself, as to all outward<br>
appearance, as any mad woman in Bedlam. Nor was she only disconsolate<br>
as to me, but she was struck with horror at the sense of her own wicked<br>
life, and began to look back upon it with a taste quite different from<br>
mine, for she was penitent to the highest degree for her sins, as well<br>
as sorrowful for the misfortune. She sent for a minister, too, a<br>
serious, pious, good man, and applied herself with such earnestness, by<br>
his assistance, to the work of a sincere repentance, that I believe,<br>
and so did the minister too, that she was a true penitent; and, which<br>
is still more, she was not only so for the occasion, and at that<br>
juncture, but she continued so, as I was informed, to the day of her<br>
death.<br>
<br>
It is rather to be thought of than expressed what was now my condition.<br>
I had nothing before me but present death; and as I had no friends to<br>
assist me, or to stir for me, I expected nothing but to find my name in<br>
the dead warrant, which was to come down for the execution, the Friday<br>
afterwards, of five more and myself.<br>
<br>
In the meantime my poor distressed governess sent me a minister, who at<br>
her request first, and at my own afterwards, came to visit me. He<br>
exhorted me seriously to repent of all my sins, and to dally no longer<br>
with my soul; not flattering myself with hopes of life, which, he said,<br>
he was informed there was no room to expect, but unfeignedly to look up<br>
to God with my whole soul, and to cry for pardon in the name of Jesus<br>
Christ. He backed his discourses with proper quotations of Scripture,<br>
encouraging the greatest sinner to repent, and turn from their evil<br>
way, and when he had done, he kneeled down and prayed with me.<br>
<br>
It was now that, for the first time, I felt any real signs of<br>
repentance. I now began to look back upon my past life with abhorrence,<br>
and having a kind of view into the other side of time, and things of<br>
life, as I believe they do with everybody at such a time, began to look<br>
with a different aspect, and quite another shape, than they did before.<br>
The greatest and best things, the views of felicity, the joy, the<br>
griefs of life, were quite other things; and I had nothing in my<br>
thoughts but what was so infinitely superior to what I had known in<br>
life, that it appeared to me to be the greatest stupidity in nature to<br>
lay any weight upon anything, though the most valuable in this world.<br>
<br>
The word eternity represented itself with all its incomprehensible<br>
additions, and I had such extended notions of it, that I know not how<br>
to express them. Among the rest, how vile, how gross, how absurd did<br>
every pleasant thing look!&mdash;I mean, that we had counted pleasant<br>
before&mdash;especially when I reflected that these sordid trifles were the<br>
things for which we forfeited eternal felicity.<br>
<br>
With these reflections came, of mere course, severe reproaches of my<br>
own mind for my wretched behaviour in my past life; that I had<br>
forfeited all hope of any happiness in the eternity that I was just<br>
going to enter into, and on the contrary was entitled to all that was<br>
miserable, or had been conceived of misery; and all this with the<br>
frightful addition of its being also eternal.<br>
<br>
I am not capable of reading lectures of instruction to anybody, but I<br>
relate this in the very manner in which things then appeared to me, as<br>
far as I am able, but infinitely short of the lively impressions which<br>
they made on my soul at that time; indeed, those impressions are not to<br>
be explained by words, or if they are, I am not mistress of words<br>
enough to express them. It must be the work of every sober reader to<br>
make just reflections on them, as their own circumstances may direct;<br>
and, without question, this is what every one at some time or other may<br>
feel something of; I mean, a clearer sight into things to come than<br>
they had here, and a dark view of their own concern in them.<br>
<br>
But I go back to my own case. The minister pressed me to tell him, as<br>
far as I thought convenient, in what state I found myself as to the<br>
sight I had of things beyond life. He told me he did not come as<br>
ordinary of the place, whose business it is to extort confessions from<br>
prisoners, for private ends, or for the further detecting of other<br>
offenders; that his business was to move me to such freedom of<br>
discourse as might serve to disburthen my own mind, and furnish him to<br>
administer comfort to me as far as was in his power; and assured me,<br>
that whatever I said to him should remain with him, and be as much a<br>
secret as if it was known only to God and myself; and that he desired<br>
to know nothing of me, but as above to qualify him to apply proper<br>
advice and assistance to me, and to pray to God for me.<br>
<br>
This honest, friendly way of treating me unlocked all the sluices of my<br>
passions. He broke into my very soul by it; and I unravelled all the<br>
wickedness of my life to him. In a word, I gave him an abridgment of<br>
this whole history; I gave him a picture of my conduct for fifty years<br>
in miniature.<br>
<br>
I hid nothing from him, and he in return exhorted me to sincere<br>
repentance, explained to me what he meant by repentance, and then drew<br>
out such a scheme of infinite mercy, proclaimed from heaven to sinners<br>
of the greatest magnitude, that he left me nothing to say, that looked<br>
like despair, or doubting of being accepted; and in this condition he<br>
left me the first night.<br>
<br>
He visited me again the next morning, and went on with his method of<br>
explaining the terms of divine mercy, which according to him consisted<br>
of nothing more, or more difficult, than that of being sincerely<br>
desirous of it, and willing to accept it; only a sincere regret for,<br>
and hatred of, those things I had done, which rendered me so just an<br>
object of divine vengeance. I am not able to repeat the excellent<br>
discourses of this extraordinary man; &rsquo;tis all that I am able to do, to<br>
say that he revived my heart, and brought me into such a condition that<br>
I never knew anything of in my life before. I was covered with shame<br>
and tears for things past, and yet had at the same time a secret<br>
surprising joy at the prospect of being a true penitent, and obtaining<br>
the comfort of a penitent&mdash;I mean, the hope of being forgiven; and so<br>
swift did thoughts circulate, and so high did the impressions they had<br>
made upon me run, that I thought I could freely have gone out that<br>
minute to execution, without any uneasiness at all, casting my soul<br>
entirely into the arms of infinite mercy as a penitent.<br>
<br>
The good gentleman was so moved also in my behalf with a view of the<br>
influence which he saw these things had on me, that he blessed God he<br>
had come to visit me, and resolved not to leave me till the last<br>
moment; that is, not to leave visiting me.<br>
<br>
It was no less than twelve days after our receiving sentence before any<br>
were ordered for execution, and then upon a Wednesday the dead warrant,<br>
as they call it, came down, and I found my name was among them. A<br>
terrible blow this was to my new resolutions; indeed my heart sank<br>
within me, and I swooned away twice, one after another, but spoke not a<br>
word. The good minister was sorely afflicted for me, and did what he<br>
could to comfort me with the same arguments, and the same moving<br>
eloquence that he did before, and left me not that evening so long as<br>
the prisonkeepers would suffer him to stay in the prison, unless he<br>
would be locked up with me all night, which he was not willing to be.<br>
<br>
I wondered much that I did not see him all the next day, it being the<br>
day before the time appointed for execution; and I was greatly<br>
discouraged, and dejected in my mind, and indeed almost sank for want<br>
of the comfort which he had so often, and with such success, yielded me<br>
on his former visits. I waited with great impatience, and under the<br>
greatest oppressions of spirits imaginable, till about four o&rsquo;clock he<br>
came to my apartment; for I had obtained the favour, by the help of<br>
money, nothing being to be done in that place without it, not to be<br>
kept in the condemned hole, as they call it, among the rest of the<br>
prisoners who were to die, but to have a little dirty chamber to<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
My heart leaped within me for joy when I heard his voice at the door,<br>
even before I saw him; but let any one judge what kind of motion I<br>
found in my soul, when after having made a short excuse for his not<br>
coming, he showed me that his time had been employed on my account;<br>
that he had obtained a favourable report from the Recorder to the<br>
Secretary of State in my particular case, and, in short, that he had<br>
brought me a reprieve.<br>
<br>
He used all the caution that he was able in letting me know a thing<br>
which it would have been a double cruelty to have concealed; and yet it<br>
was too much for me; for as grief had overset me before, so did joy<br>
overset me now, and I fell into a much more dangerous swooning than I<br>
did at first, and it was not without a great difficulty that I was<br>
recovered at all.<br>
<br>
The good man having made a very Christian exhortation to me, not to let<br>
the joy of my reprieve put the remembrance of my past sorrow out of my<br>
mind, and having told me that he must leave me, to go and enter the<br>
reprieve in the books, and show it to the sheriffs, stood up just<br>
before his going away, and in a very earnest manner prayed to God for<br>
me, that my repentance might be made unfeigned and sincere; and that my<br>
coming back, as it were, into life again, might not be a returning to<br>
the follies of life which I had made such solemn resolutions to<br>
forsake, and to repent of them. I joined heartily in the petition, and<br>
must needs say I had deeper impressions upon my mind all that night, of<br>
the mercy of God in sparing my life, and a greater detestation of my<br>
past sins, from a sense of the goodness which I had tasted in this<br>
case, than I had in all my sorrow before.<br>
<br>
This may be thought inconsistent in itself, and wide from the business<br>
of this book; particularly, I reflect that many of those who may be<br>
pleased and diverted with the relation of the wild and wicked part of<br>
my story may not relish this, which is really the best part of my life,<br>
the most advantageous to myself, and the most instructive to others.<br>
Such, however, will, I hope, allow me the liberty to make my story<br>
complete. It would be a severe satire on such to say they do not relish<br>
the repentance as much as they do the crime; and that they had rather<br>
the history were a complete tragedy, as it was very likely to have<br>
been.<br>
<br>
But I go on with my relation. The next morning there was a sad scene<br>
indeed in the prison. The first thing I was saluted with in the morning<br>
was the tolling of the great bell at St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s, as they call it,<br>
which ushered in the day. As soon as it began to toll, a dismal<br>
groaning and crying was heard from the condemned hole, where there lay<br>
six poor souls who were to be executed that day, some from one crime,<br>
some for another, and two of them for murder.<br>
<br>
This was followed by a confused clamour in the house, among the several<br>
sorts of prisoners, expressing their awkward sorrows for the poor<br>
creatures that were to die, but in a manner extremely differing one<br>
from another. Some cried for them; some huzzaed, and wished them a good<br>
journey; some damned and cursed those that had brought them to it&mdash;that<br>
is, meaning the evidence, or prosecutors&mdash;many pitying them, and some<br>
few, but very few, praying for them.<br>
<br>
There was hardly room for so much composure of mind as was required for<br>
me to bless the merciful Providence that had, as it were, snatched me<br>
out of the jaws of this destruction. I remained, as it were, dumb and<br>
silent, overcome with the sense of it, and not able to express what I<br>
had in my heart; for the passions on such occasions as these are<br>
certainly so agitated as not to be able presently to regulate their own<br>
motions.<br>
<br>
All the while the poor condemned creatures were preparing to their<br>
death, and the ordinary, as they call him, was busy with them,<br>
disposing them to submit to their sentence&mdash;I say, all this while I was<br>
seized with a fit of trembling, as much as I could have been if I had<br>
been in the same condition, as to be sure the day before I expected to<br>
be; I was so violently agitated by this surprising fit, that I shook as<br>
if it had been in the cold fit of an ague, so that I could not speak or<br>
look but like one distracted. As soon as they were all put into carts<br>
and gone, which, however, I had not courage enough to see&mdash;I say, as<br>
soon as they were gone, I fell into a fit of crying involuntarily, and<br>
without design, but as a mere distemper, and yet so violent, and it<br>
held me so long, that I knew not what course to take, nor could I stop,<br>
or put a check to it, no, not with all the strength and courage I had.<br>
<br>
This fit of crying held me near two hours, and, as I believe, held me<br>
till they were all out of the world, and then a most humble, penitent,<br>
serious kind of joy succeeded; a real transport it was, or passion of<br>
joy and thankfulness, but still unable to give vent to it by words, and<br>
in this I continued most part of the day.<br>
<br>
In the evening the good minister visited me again, and then fell to his<br>
usual good discourses. He congratulated my having a space yet allowed<br>
me for repentance, whereas the state of those six poor creatures was<br>
determined, and they were now past the offers of salvation; he<br>
earnestly pressed me to retain the same sentiments of the things of<br>
life that I had when I had a view of eternity; and at the end of all<br>
told me I should not conclude that all was over, that a reprieve was<br>
not a pardon, that he could not yet answer for the effects of it;<br>
however, I had this mercy, that I had more time given me, and that it<br>
was my business to improve that time.<br>
<br>
This discourse, though very seasonable, left a kind of sadness on my<br>
heart, as if I might expect the affair would have a tragical issue<br>
still, which, however, he had no certainty of; and I did not indeed, at<br>
that time, question him about it, he having said that he would do his<br>
utmost to bring it to a good end, and that he hoped he might, but he<br>
would not have me be secure; and the consequence proved that he had<br>
reason for what he said.<br>
<br>
It was about a fortnight after this that I had some just apprehensions<br>
that I should be included in the next dead warrant at the ensuing<br>
sessions; and it was not without great difficulty, and at last a humble<br>
petition for transportation, that I avoided it, so ill was I beholding<br>
to fame, and so prevailing was the fatal report of being an old<br>
offender; though in that they did not do me strict justice, for I was<br>
not in the sense of the law an old offender, whatever I was in the eye<br>
of the judge, for I had never been before them in a judicial way<br>
before; so the judges could not charge me with being an old offender,<br>
but the Recorder was pleased to represent my case as he thought fit.<br>
<br>
I had now a certainty of life indeed, but with the hard conditions of<br>
being ordered for transportation, which indeed was hard condition in<br>
itself, but not when comparatively considered; and therefore I shall<br>
make no comments upon the sentence, nor upon the choice I was put to.<br>
We shall all choose anything rather than death, especially when &rsquo;tis<br>
attended with an uncomfortable prospect beyond it, which was my case.<br>
<br>
The good minister, whose interest, though a stranger to me, had<br>
obtained me the reprieve, mourned sincerely for this part. He was in<br>
hopes, he said, that I should have ended my days under the influence of<br>
good instruction, that I should not have been turned loose again among<br>
such a wretched crew as they generally are, who are thus sent abroad,<br>
where, as he said, I must have more than ordinary secret assistance<br>
from the grace of God, if I did not turn as wicked again as ever.<br>
<br>
I have not for a good while mentioned my governess, who had during<br>
most, if not all, of this part been dangerously sick, and being in as<br>
near a view of death by her disease as I was by my sentence, was a<br>
great penitent&mdash;I say, I have not mentioned her, nor indeed did I see<br>
her in all this time; but being now recovering, and just able to come<br>
abroad, she came to see me.<br>
<br>
I told her my condition, and what a different flux and reflux of tears<br>
and hopes I had been agitated with; I told her what I had escaped, and<br>
upon what terms; and she was present when the minister expressed his<br>
fears of my relapsing into wickedness upon my falling into the wretched<br>
companies that are generally transported. Indeed I had a melancholy<br>
reflection upon it in my own mind, for I knew what a dreadful gang was<br>
always sent away together, and I said to my governess that the good<br>
minister&rsquo;s fears were not without cause. &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;but I<br>
hope you will not be tempted with such a horrid example as that.&rdquo; And<br>
as soon as the minister was gone, she told me she would not have me<br>
discouraged, for perhaps ways and means might be found out to dispose<br>
of me in a particular way, by myself, of which she would talk further<br>
to me afterward.<br>
<br>
I looked earnestly at her, and I thought she looked more cheerful than<br>
she usually had done, and I entertained immediately a thousand notions<br>
of being delivered, but could not for my life image the methods, or<br>
think of one that was in the least feasible; but I was too much<br>
concerned in it to let her go from me without explaining herself,<br>
which, though she was very loth to do, yet my importunity prevailed,<br>
and, while I was still pressing, she answered me in a few words, thus:<br>
&ldquo;Why, you have money, have you not? Did you ever know one in your life<br>
that was transported and had a hundred pounds in his pocket, I&rsquo;ll<br>
warrant you, child?&rdquo; says she.<br>
<br>
I understood her presently, but told her I would leave all that to her,<br>
but I saw no room to hope for anything but a strict execution of the<br>
order, and as it was a severity that was esteemed a mercy, there was no<br>
doubt but it would be strictly observed. She said no more but this: &ldquo;We<br>
will try what can be done,&rdquo; and so we parted for that night.<br>
<br>
I lay in the prison near fifteen weeks after this order for<br>
transportation was signed. What the reason of it was, I know not, but<br>
at the end of this time I was put on board of a ship in the Thames, and<br>
with me a gang of thirteen as hardened vile creatures as ever Newgate<br>
produced in my time; and it would really well take up a history longer<br>
than mine to describe the degrees of impudence and audacious villainy<br>
that those thirteen were arrived to, and the manner of their behaviour<br>
in the voyage; of which I have a very diverting account by me, which<br>
the captain of the ship who carried them over gave me the minutes of,<br>
and which he caused his mate to write down at large.<br>
<br>
It may perhaps be thought trifling to enter here into a relation of all<br>
the little incidents which attended me in this interval of my<br>
circumstances; I mean, between the final order of my transportation and<br>
the time of my going on board the ship; and I am too near the end of my<br>
story to allow room for it; but something relating to me and my<br>
Lancashire husband I must not omit.<br>
<br>
He had, as I have observed already, been carried from the master&rsquo;s side<br>
of the ordinary prison into the press-yard, with three of his comrades,<br>
for they found another to add to them after some time; here, for what<br>
reason I knew not, they were kept in custody without being brought to<br>
trial almost three months. It seems they found means to bribe or buy<br>
off some of those who were expected to come in against them, and they<br>
wanted evidence for some time to convict them. After some puzzle on<br>
this account, at first they made a shift to get proof enough against<br>
two of them to carry them off; but the other two, of which my<br>
Lancashire husband was one, lay still in suspense. They had, I think,<br>
one positive evidence against each of them, but the law strictly<br>
obliging them to have two witnesses, they could make nothing of it. Yet<br>
it seems they were resolved not to part with the men neither, not<br>
doubting but a further evidence would at last come in; and in order to<br>
this, I think publication was made, that such prisoners being taken,<br>
any one that had been robbed by them might come to the prison and see<br>
them.<br>
<br>
I took this opportunity to satisfy my curiosity, pretending that I had<br>
been robbed in the Dunstable coach, and that I would go to see the two<br>
highwaymen. But when I came into the press-yard, I so disguised myself,<br>
and muffled my face up so, that he could see little of me, and<br>
consequently knew nothing of who I was; and when I came back, I said<br>
publicly that I knew them very well.<br>
<br>
Immediately it was rumoured all over the prison that Moll Flanders<br>
would turn evidence against one of the highwaymen, and that I was to<br>
come off by it from the sentence of transportation.<br>
<br>
They heard of it, and immediately my husband desired to see this Mrs.<br>
Flanders that knew him so well, and was to be an evidence against him;<br>
and accordingly I had leave given to go to him. I dressed myself up as<br>
well as the best clothes that I suffered myself ever to appear in there<br>
would allow me, and went to the press-yard, but had for some time a<br>
hood over my face. He said little to me at first, but asked me if I<br>
knew him. I told him, Yes, very well; but as I concealed my face, so I<br>
counterfeited my voice, that he had not the least guess at who I was.<br>
He asked me where I had seen him. I told him between Dunstable and<br>
Brickhill; but turning to the keeper that stood by, I asked if I might<br>
not be admitted to talk with him alone. He said Yes, yes, as much as I<br>
pleased, and so very civilly withdrew.<br>
<br>
As soon as he was gone, I had shut the door, I threw off my hood, and<br>
bursting out into tears, &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;do you not know me?&rdquo; He<br>
turned pale, and stood speechless, like one thunderstruck, and, not<br>
able to conquer the surprise, said no more but this, &ldquo;Let me sit down&rdquo;;<br>
and sitting down by a table, he laid his elbow upon the table, and<br>
leaning his head on his hand, fixed his eyes on the ground as one<br>
stupid. I cried so vehemently, on the other hand, that it was a good<br>
while ere I could speak any more; but after I had given some vent to my<br>
passion by tears, I repeated the same words, &ldquo;My dear, do you not know<br>
me?&rdquo; At which he answered, Yes, and said no more a good while.<br>
<br>
After some time continuing in the surprise, as above, he cast up his<br>
eyes towards me and said, &ldquo;How could you be so cruel?&rdquo; I did not<br>
readily understand what he meant; and I answered, &ldquo;How can you call me<br>
cruel? What have I been cruel to you in?&rdquo; &ldquo;To come to me,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;in<br>
such a place as this, is it not to insult me? I have not robbed you, at<br>
least not on the highway.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I perceived by this that he knew nothing of the miserable circumstances<br>
I was in, and thought that, having got some intelligence of his being<br>
there, I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me. But I had too<br>
much to say to him to be affronted, and told him in few words, that I<br>
was far from coming to insult him, but at best I came to condole<br>
mutually; that he would be easily satisfied that I had no such view,<br>
when I should tell him that my condition was worse than his, and that<br>
many ways. He looked a little concerned at the general expression of my<br>
condition being worse than his, but, with a kind smile, looked a little<br>
wildly, and said, &ldquo;How can that be? When you see me fettered, and in<br>
Newgate, and two of my companions executed already, how can your your<br>
condition be worse than mine?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;we have a long piece of work to do, if I<br>
should be to relate, or you to hear, my unfortunate history; but if you<br>
are disposed to hear it, you will soon conclude with me that my<br>
condition is worse than yours.&rdquo; &ldquo;How is that possible,&rdquo; says he again,<br>
&ldquo;when I expect to be cast for my life the very next sessions?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;<br>
says I, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis very possible, when I shall tell you that I have been<br>
cast for my life three sessions ago, and am under sentence of death; is<br>
not my case worse than yours?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
Then indeed, he stood silent again, like one struck dumb, and after a<br>
while he starts up. &ldquo;Unhappy couple!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;How can this be<br>
possible?&rdquo; I took him by the hand. &ldquo;Come, my dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;sit down,<br>
and let us compare our sorrows. I am a prisoner in this very house, and<br>
in much worse circumstances than you, and you will be satisfied I do<br>
not come to insult you, when I tell you the particulars.&rdquo; And with this<br>
we sat down together, and I told him so much of my story as I thought<br>
was convenient, bringing it at last to my being reduced to great<br>
poverty, and representing myself as fallen into some company that led<br>
me to relieve my distresses by way that I had been utterly unacquainted<br>
with, and that they making an attempt at a tradesman&rsquo;s house, I was<br>
seized upon for having been but just at the door, the maid-servant<br>
pulling me in; that I neither had broke any lock nor taken anything<br>
away, and that notwithstanding that, I was brought in guilty and<br>
sentenced to die; but that the judges, having been made sensible of the<br>
hardship of my circumstances, had obtained leave to remit the sentence<br>
upon my consenting to be transported.<br>
<br>
I told him I fared the worse for being taken in the prison for one Moll<br>
Flanders, who was a famous successful thief, that all of them had heard<br>
of, but none of them had ever seen; but that, as he knew well, was none<br>
of my name. But I placed all to the account of my ill fortune, and that<br>
under this name I was dealt with as an old offender, though this was<br>
the first thing they had ever known of me. I gave him a long particular<br>
of things that had befallen me since I saw him, but I told him if I had<br>
seen him since he might think I had, and then gave him an account how I<br>
had seen him at Brickhill; how furiously he was pursued, and how, by<br>
giving an account that I knew him, and that he was a very honest<br>
gentleman, one Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, the hue-and-cry was stopped, and the high<br>
constable went back again.<br>
<br>
He listened most attentively to all my story, and smiled at most of the<br>
particulars, being all of them petty matters, and infinitely below what<br>
he had been at the head of; but when I came to the story of Brickhill,<br>
he was surprised. &ldquo;And was it you, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that gave the<br>
check to the mob that was at our heels there, at Brickhill?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;<br>
said I, &ldquo;it was I indeed.&rdquo; And then I told him the particulars which I<br>
had observed him there. &ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was you that saved my<br>
life at that time, and I am glad I owe my life to you, for I will pay<br>
the debt to you now, and I&rsquo;ll deliver you from the present condition<br>
you are in, or I will die in the attempt.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I told him, by no means; it was a risk too great, not worth his running<br>
the hazard of, and for a life not worth his saving. &rsquo;Twas no matter for<br>
that, he said, it was a life worth all the world to him; a life that<br>
had given him a new life; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I was never in real danger<br>
of being taken, but that time, till the last minute when I was taken.&rdquo;<br>
Indeed, he told me his danger then lay in his believing he had not been<br>
pursued that way; for they had gone off from Hockey quite another way,<br>
and had come over the enclosed country into Brickhill, not by the road,<br>
and were sure they had not been seen by anybody.<br>
<br>
Here he gave me a long history of his life, which indeed would make a<br>
very strange history, and be infinitely diverting. He told me he took<br>
to the road about twelve years before he married me; that the woman<br>
which called him brother was not really his sister, or any kin to him,<br>
but one that belonged to their gang, and who, keeping correspondence<br>
with him, lived always in town, having good store of acquaintance; that<br>
she gave them a perfect intelligence of persons going out of town, and<br>
that they had made several good booties by her correspondence; that she<br>
thought she had fixed a fortune for him when she brought me to him, but<br>
happened to be disappointed, which he really could not blame her for;<br>
that if it had been his good luck that I had had the estate, which she<br>
was informed I had, he had resolved to leave off the road and live a<br>
retired, sober life but never to appear in public till some general<br>
pardon had been passed, or till he could, for money, have got his name<br>
into some particular pardon, that so he might have been perfectly easy;<br>
but that, as it had proved otherwise, he was obliged to put off his<br>
equipage and take up the old trade again.<br>
<br>
He gave me a long account of some of his adventures, and particularly<br>
one when he robbed the West Chester coaches near Lichfield, when he got<br>
a very great booty; and after that, how he robbed five graziers, in the<br>
west, going to Burford Fair in Wiltshire to buy sheep. He told me he<br>
got so much money on those two occasions, that if he had known where to<br>
have found me, he would certainly have embraced my proposal of going<br>
with me to Virginia, or to have settled in a plantation on some other<br>
parts of the English colonies in America.<br>
<br>
He told me he wrote two or three letters to me, directed according to<br>
my order, but heard nothing from me. This I indeed knew to be true, but<br>
the letters coming to my hand in the time of my latter husband, I could<br>
do nothing in it, and therefore chose to give no answer, that so he<br>
might rather believe they had miscarried.<br>
<br>
Being thus disappointed, he said, he carried on the old trade ever<br>
since, though when he had gotten so much money, he said, he did not run<br>
such desperate risks as he did before. Then he gave me some account of<br>
several hard and desperate encounters which he had with gentlemen on<br>
the road, who parted too hardly with their money, and showed me some<br>
wounds he had received; and he had one or two very terrible wounds<br>
indeed, as particularly one by a pistol bullet, which broke his arm,<br>
and another with a sword, which ran him quite through the body, but<br>
that missing his vitals, he was cured again; one of his comrades having<br>
kept with him so faithfully, and so friendly, as that he assisted him<br>
in riding near eighty miles before his arm was set, and then got a<br>
surgeon in a considerable city, remote from that place where it was<br>
done, pretending they were gentlemen travelling towards Carlisle and<br>
that they had been attacked on the road by highwaymen, and that one of<br>
them had shot him into the arm and broke the bone.<br>
<br>
This, he said, his friend managed so well, that they were not suspected<br>
at all, but lay still till he was perfectly cured. He gave me so many<br>
distinct accounts of his adventures, that it is with great reluctance<br>
that I decline the relating them; but I consider that this is my own<br>
story, not his.<br>
<br>
I then inquired into the circumstances of his present case at that<br>
time, and what it was he expected when he came to be tried. He told me<br>
that they had no evidence against him, or but very little; for that of<br>
three robberies, which they were all charged with, it was his good<br>
fortune that he was but in one of them, and that there was but one<br>
witness to be had for that fact, which was not sufficient, but that it<br>
was expected some others would come in against him; that he thought<br>
indeed, when he first saw me, that I had been one that came of that<br>
errand; but that if somebody came in against him, he hoped he should be<br>
cleared; that he had had some intimation, that if he would submit to<br>
transport himself, he might be admitted to it without a trial, but that<br>
he could not think of it with any temper, and thought he could much<br>
easier submit to be hanged.<br>
<br>
I blamed him for that, and told him I blamed him on two accounts;<br>
first, because if he was transported, there might be a hundred ways for<br>
him that was a gentleman, and a bold enterprising man, to find his way<br>
back again, and perhaps some ways and means to come back before he<br>
went. He smiled at that part, and said he should like the last the best<br>
of the two, for he had a kind of horror upon his mind at his being sent<br>
over to the plantations, as Romans sent condemned slaves to work in the<br>
mines; that he thought the passage into another state, let it be what<br>
it would, much more tolerable at the gallows, and that this was the<br>
general notion of all the gentlemen who were driven by the exigence of<br>
their fortunes to take the road; that at the place of execution there<br>
was at least an end of all the miseries of the present state, and as<br>
for what was to follow, a man was, in his opinion, as likely to repent<br>
sincerely in the last fortnight of his life, under the pressures and<br>
agonies of a jail and the condemned hole, as he would ever be in the<br>
woods and wilderness of America; that servitude and hard labour were<br>
things gentlemen could never stoop to; that it was but the way to force<br>
them to be their own executioners afterwards, which was much worse; and<br>
that therefore he could not have any patience when he did but think of<br>
being transported.<br>
<br>
I used the utmost of my endeavour to persuade him, and joined that<br>
known woman&rsquo;s rhetoric to it&mdash;I mean, that of tears. I told him the<br>
infamy of a public execution was certainly a greater pressure upon the<br>
spirits of a gentleman than any of the mortifications that he could<br>
meet with abroad could be; that he had at least in the other a chance<br>
for his life, whereas here he had none at all; that it was the easiest<br>
thing in the world for him to manage the captain of a ship, who were,<br>
generally speaking, men of good-humour and some gallantry; and a small<br>
matter of conduct, especially if there was any money to be had, would<br>
make way for him to buy himself off when he came to Virginia.<br>
<br>
He looked wistfully at me, and I thought I guessed at what he meant,<br>
that is to say, that he had no money; but I was mistaken, his meaning<br>
was another way. &ldquo;You hinted just now, my dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that there<br>
might be a way of coming back before I went, by which I understood you<br>
that it might be possible to buy it off here. I had rather give &pound;200 to<br>
prevent going, than &pound;100 to be set at liberty when I came there.&rdquo; &ldquo;That<br>
is, my dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;because you do not know the place so well as I<br>
do.&rdquo; &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and yet I believe, as well as you know<br>
it, you would do the same, unless it is because, as you told me, you<br>
have a mother there.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I told him, as to my mother, it was next to impossible but that she<br>
must be dead many years before; and as for any other relations that I<br>
might have there, I knew them not now; that since the misfortunes I had<br>
been under had reduced me to the condition I had been in for some<br>
years, I had not kept up any correspondence with them; and that he<br>
would easily believe, I should find but a cold reception from them if I<br>
should be put to make my first visit in the condition of a transported<br>
felon; that therefore, if I went thither, I resolved not to see them;<br>
but that I had many views in going there, if it should be my fate,<br>
which took off all the uneasy part of it; and if he found himself<br>
obliged to go also, I should easily instruct him how to manage himself,<br>
so as never to go a servant at all, especially since I found he was not<br>
destitute of money, which was the only friend in such a condition.<br>
<br>
He smiled, and said he did not tell me he had money. I took him up<br>
short, and told him I hoped he did not understand by my speaking, that<br>
I should expect any supply from him if he had money; that, on the other<br>
hand, though I had not a great deal, yet I did not want, and while I<br>
had any I would rather add to him than weaken him in that article,<br>
seeing, whatever he had, I knew in the case of transportation he would<br>
have occasion of it all.<br>
<br>
He expressed himself in a most tender manner upon that head. He told me<br>
what money he had was not a great deal, but that he would never hide<br>
any of it from me if I wanted it, and that he assured me he did not<br>
speak with any such apprehensions; that he was only intent upon what I<br>
had hinted to him before he went; that here he knew what to do with<br>
himself, but that there he should be the most ignorant, helpless wretch<br>
alive.<br>
<br>
I told him he frighted and terrified himself with that which had no<br>
terror in it; that if he had money, as I was glad to hear he had, he<br>
might not only avoid the servitude supposed to be the consequence of<br>
transportation, but begin the world upon a new foundation, and that<br>
such a one as he could not fail of success in, with the common<br>
application usual in such cases; that he could not but call to mind<br>
that it was what I had recommended to him many years before and had<br>
proposed it for our mutual subsistence and restoring our fortunes in<br>
the world; and I would tell him now, that to convince him both of the<br>
certainty of it and of my being fully acquainted with the method, and<br>
also fully satisfied in the probability of success, he should first see<br>
me deliver myself from the necessity of going over at all, and then<br>
that I would go with him freely, and of my own choice, and perhaps<br>
carry enough with me to satisfy him that I did not offer it for want of<br>
being able to live without assistance from him, but that I thought our<br>
mutual misfortunes had been such as were sufficient to reconcile us<br>
both to quitting this part of the world, and living where nobody could<br>
upbraid us with what was past, or we be in any dread of a prison, and<br>
without agonies of a condemned hole to drive us to it; this where we<br>
should look back on all our past disasters with infinite satisfaction,<br>
when we should consider that our enemies should entirely forget us, and<br>
that we should live as new people in a new world, nobody having<br>
anything to say to us, or we to them.<br>
<br>
I pressed this home to him with so many arguments, and answered all his<br>
own passionate objections so effectually that he embraced me, and told<br>
me I treated him with such sincerity and affection as overcame him;<br>
that he would take my advice, and would strive to submit to his fate in<br>
hope of having the comfort of my assistance, and of so faithful a<br>
counsellor and such a companion in his misery. But still he put me in<br>
mind of what I had mentioned before, namely, that there might be some<br>
way to get off before he went, and that it might be possible to avoid<br>
going at all, which he said would be much better. I told him he should<br>
see, and be fully satisfied, that I would do my utmost in that part<br>
too, and if it did not succeed, yet that I would make good the rest.<br>
<br>
We parted after this long conference with such testimonies of kindness<br>
and affection as I thought were equal, if not superior, to that at our<br>
parting at Dunstable; and now I saw more plainly than before, the<br>
reason why he declined coming at that time any farther with me toward<br>
London than Dunstable, and why, when we parted there, he told me it was<br>
not convenient for him to come part of the way to London to bring me<br>
going, as he would otherwise have done. I have observed that the<br>
account of his life would have made a much more pleasing history than<br>
this of mine; and, indeed, nothing in it was more strange than this<br>
part, viz. that he carried on that desperate trade full five-and-twenty<br>
years and had never been taken, the success he had met with had been so<br>
very uncommon, and such that sometimes he had lived handsomely, and<br>
retired in place for a year or two at a time, keeping himself and a<br>
man-servant to wait on him, and had often sat in the coffee-houses and<br>
heard the very people whom he had robbed give accounts of their being<br>
robbed, and of the place and circumstances, so that he could easily<br>
remember that it was the same.<br>
<br>
In this manner, it seems, he lived near Liverpool at the time he<br>
unluckily married me for a fortune. Had I been the fortune he expected,<br>
I verily believe, as he said, that he would have taken up and lived<br>
honestly all his days.<br>
<br>
He had with the rest of his misfortunes the good luck not to be<br>
actually upon the spot when the robbery was done which he was committed<br>
for, and so none of the persons robbed could swear to him, or had<br>
anything to charge upon him. But it seems as he was taken with the<br>
gang, one hard-mouthed countryman swore home to him, and they were like<br>
to have others come in according to the publication they had made; so<br>
that they expected more evidence against him, and for that reason he<br>
was kept in hold.<br>
<br>
However, the offer which was made to him of admitting him to<br>
transportation was made, as I understood, upon the intercession of some<br>
great person who pressed him hard to accept of it before a trial; and<br>
indeed, as he knew there were several that might come in against him, I<br>
thought his friend was in the right, and I lay at him night and day to<br>
delay it no longer.<br>
<br>
At last, with much difficulty, he gave his consent; and as he was not<br>
therefore admitted to transportation in court, and on his petition, as<br>
I was, so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking<br>
himself as I had said he might have done; his great friend, who was his<br>
intercessor for the favour of that grant, having given security for him<br>
that he should transport himself, and not return within the term.<br>
<br>
This hardship broke all my measures, for the steps I took afterwards<br>
for my own deliverance were hereby rendered wholly ineffectual, unless<br>
I would abandon him, and leave him to go to America by himself; than<br>
which he protested he would much rather venture, although he were<br>
certain to go directly to the gallows.<br>
<br>
I must now return to my case. The time of my being transported<br>
according to my sentence was near at hand; my governess, who continued<br>
my fast friend, had tried to obtain a pardon, but it could not be done<br>
unless with an expense too heavy for my purse, considering that to be<br>
left naked and empty, unless I had resolved to return to my old trade<br>
again, had been worse than my transportation, because there I knew I<br>
could live, here I could not. The good minister stood very hard on<br>
another account to prevent my being transported also; but he was<br>
answered, that indeed my life had been given me at his first<br>
solicitations, and therefore he ought to ask no more. He was sensibly<br>
grieved at my going, because, as he said, he feared I should lose the<br>
good impressions which a prospect of death had at first made on me, and<br>
which were since increased by his instructions; and the pious gentleman<br>
was exceedingly concerned about me on that account.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I really was not so solicitous about it as I was<br>
before, but I industriously concealed my reasons for it from the<br>
minister, and to the last he did not know but that I went with the<br>
utmost reluctance and affliction.<br>
<br>
It was in the month of February that I was, with seven other convicts,<br>
as they called us, delivered to a merchant that traded to Virginia, on<br>
board a ship, riding, as they called it, in Deptford Reach. The officer<br>
of the prison delivered us on board, and the master of the vessel gave<br>
a discharge for us.<br>
<br>
We were for that night clapped under hatches, and kept so close that I<br>
thought I should have been suffocated for want of air; and the next<br>
morning the ship weighed, and fell down the river to a place they call<br>
Bugby&rsquo;s Hole, which was done, as they told us, by the agreement of the<br>
merchant, that all opportunity of escape should be taken from us.<br>
However, when the ship came thither and cast anchor, we were allowed<br>
more liberty, and particularly were permitted to come up on the deck,<br>
but not up on the quarter-deck, that being kept particularly for the<br>
captain and for passengers.<br>
<br>
When by the noise of the men over my head, and the motion of the ship,<br>
I perceived that they were under sail, I was at first greatly<br>
surprised, fearing we should go away directly, and that our friends<br>
would not be admitted to see us any more; but I was easy soon after,<br>
when I found they had come to an anchor again, and soon after that we<br>
had notice given by some of the men where we were, that the next<br>
morning we should have the liberty to come up on deck, and to have our<br>
friends come and see us if we had any.<br>
<br>
All that night I lay upon the hard boards of the deck, as the<br>
passengers did, but we had afterwards the liberty of little cabins for<br>
such of us as had any bedding to lay in them, and room to stow any box<br>
or trunk for clothes and linen, if we had it (which might well be put<br>
in), for some of them had neither shirt nor shift or a rag of linen or<br>
woollen, but what was on their backs, or a farthing of money to help<br>
themselves; and yet I did not find but they fared well enough in the<br>
ship, especially the women, who got money from the seamen for washing<br>
their clothes, sufficient to purchase any common things that they<br>
wanted.<br>
<br>
When the next morning we had the liberty to come up on the deck, I<br>
asked one of the officers of the ship, whether I might not have the<br>
liberty to send a letter on shore, to let my friends know where the<br>
ship lay, and to get some necessary things sent to me. This was, it<br>
seems, the boatswain, a very civil, courteous sort of man, who told me<br>
I should have that, or any other liberty that I desired, that he could<br>
allow me with safety. I told him I desired no other; and he answered<br>
that the ship&rsquo;s boat would go up to London the next tide, and he would<br>
order my letter to be carried.<br>
<br>
Accordingly, when the boat went off, the boatswain came to me and told<br>
me the boat was going off, and that he went in it himself, and asked me<br>
if my letter was ready he would take care of it. I had prepared myself,<br>
you may be sure, pen, ink, and paper beforehand, and I had gotten a<br>
letter ready directed to my governess, and enclosed another for my<br>
fellow-prisoner, which, however, I did not let her know was my husband,<br>
not to the last. In that to my governess, I let her know where the ship<br>
lay, and pressed her earnestly to send me what things I knew she had<br>
got ready for me for my voyage.<br>
<br>
When I gave the boatswain the letter, I gave him a shilling with it,<br>
which I told him was for the charge of a messenger or porter, which I<br>
entreated him to send with the letter as soon as he came on shore, that<br>
if possible I might have an answer brought back by the same hand, that<br>
I might know what was become of my things; &ldquo;for sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;if the<br>
ship should go away before I have them on board, I am undone.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
I took care, when I gave him the shilling, to let him see that I had a<br>
little better furniture about me than the ordinary prisoners, for he<br>
saw that I had a purse, and in it a pretty deal of money; and I found<br>
that the very sight of it immediately furnished me with very different<br>
treatment from what I should otherwise have met with in the ship; for<br>
though he was very courteous indeed before, in a kind of natural<br>
compassion to me, as a woman in distress, yet he was more than<br>
ordinarily so afterwards, and procured me to be better treated in the<br>
ship than, I say, I might otherwise have been; as shall appear in its<br>
place.<br>
<br>
He very honestly had my letter delivered to my governess&rsquo;s own hands,<br>
and brought me back an answer from her in writing; and when he gave me<br>
the answer, gave me the shilling again. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your<br>
shilling again too, for I delivered the letter myself.&rdquo; I could not<br>
tell what to say, I was so surprised at the thing; but after some<br>
pause, I said, &ldquo;Sir, you are too kind; it had been but reasonable that<br>
you had paid yourself coach-hire, then.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I am overpaid. What is the gentlewoman? Your<br>
sister.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;she is no relation to me, but she is a dear friend,<br>
and all the friends I have in the world.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there are<br>
few such friends in the world. Why, she cried after you like a child.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says I again, &ldquo;she would give a hundred pounds, I believe, to<br>
deliver me from this dreadful condition I am in.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Would she so?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;For half the money I believe I could put you<br>
in a way how to deliver yourself.&rdquo; But this he spoke softly, that<br>
nobody could hear.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Alas! sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but then that must be such a deliverance as, if I<br>
should be taken again, would cost me my life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you<br>
were once out of the ship, you must look to yourself afterwards; that I<br>
can say nothing to.&rdquo; So we dropped the discourse for that time.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, my governess, faithful to the last moment, conveyed my<br>
letter to the prison to my husband, and got an answer to it, and the<br>
next day came down herself to the ship, bringing me, in the first<br>
place, a sea-bed as they call it, and all its furniture, such as was<br>
convenient, but not to let the people think it was extraordinary. She<br>
brought with her a sea-chest&mdash;that is, a chest, such as are made for<br>
seamen, with all the conveniences in it, and filled with everything<br>
almost that I could want; and in one of the corners of the chest, where<br>
there was a private drawer, was my bank of money&mdash;this is to say, so<br>
much of it as I had resolved to carry with me; for I ordered a part of<br>
my stock to be left behind me, to be sent afterwards in such goods as I<br>
should want when I came to settle; for money in that country is not of<br>
much use where all things are brought for tobacco, much more is it a<br>
great loss to carry it from hence.<br>
<br>
But my case was particular; it was by no means proper to me to go<br>
thither without money or goods, and for a poor convict, that was to be<br>
sold as soon as I came on shore, to carry with me a cargo of goods<br>
would be to have notice taken of it, and perhaps to have them seized by<br>
the public; so I took part of my stock with me thus, and left the other<br>
part with my governess.<br>
<br>
My governess brought me a great many other things, but it was not<br>
proper for me to look too well provided in the ship, at least till I<br>
knew what kind of a captain we should have. When she came into the<br>
ship, I thought she would have died indeed; her heart sank at the sight<br>
of me, and at the thoughts of parting with me in that condition, and<br>
she cried so intolerably, I could not for a long time have any talk<br>
with her.<br>
<br>
I took that time to read my fellow-prisoner&rsquo;s letter, which, however,<br>
greatly perplexed me. He told me he was determined to go, but found it<br>
would be impossible for him to be discharged time enough for going in<br>
the same ship, and which was more than all, he began to question<br>
whether they would give him leave to go in what ship he pleased, though<br>
he did voluntarily transport himself; but that they would see him put<br>
on board such a ship as they should direct, and that he would be<br>
charged upon the captain as other convict prisoners were; so that he<br>
began to be in despair of seeing me till he came to Virginia, which<br>
made him almost desperate; seeing that, on the other hand, if I should<br>
not be there, if any accident of the sea or of mortality should take me<br>
away, he should be the most undone creature there in the world.<br>
<br>
This was very perplexing, and I knew not what course to take. I told my<br>
governess the story of the boatswain, and she was mighty eager with me<br>
treat with him; but I had no mind to it, till I heard whether my<br>
husband, or fellow-prisoner, so she called him, could be at liberty to<br>
go with me or no. At last I was forced to let her into the whole<br>
matter, except only that of his being my husband. I told her I had made<br>
a positive bargain or agreement with him to go, if he could get the<br>
liberty of going in the same ship, and that I found he had money.<br>
<br>
Then I read a long lecture to her of what I proposed to do when we came<br>
there, how we could plant, settle, and, in short, grow rich without any<br>
more adventures; and, as a great secret, I told her that we were to<br>
marry as soon as he came on board.<br>
<br>
She soon agreed cheerfully to my going when she heard this, and she<br>
made it her business from that time to get him out of the prison in<br>
time, so that he might go in the same ship with me, which at last was<br>
brought to pass, though with great difficulty, and not without all the<br>
forms of a transported prisoner-convict, which he really was not yet,<br>
for he had not been tried, and which was a great mortification to him.<br>
As our fate was now determined, and we were both on board, actually<br>
bound to Virginia, in the despicable quality of transported convicts<br>
destined to be sold for slaves, I for five years, and he under bonds<br>
and security not to return to England any more, as long as he lived, he<br>
was very much dejected and cast down; the mortification of being<br>
brought on board, as he was, like a prisoner, piqued him very much,<br>
since it was first told him he should transport himself, and so that he<br>
might go as a gentleman at liberty. It is true he was not ordered to be<br>
sold when he came there, as we were, and for that reason he was obliged<br>
to pay for his passage to the captain, which we were not; as to the<br>
rest, he was as much at a loss as a child what to do with himself, or<br>
with what he had, but by directions.<br>
<br>
Our first business was to compare our stock. He was very honest to me,<br>
and told me his stock was pretty good when he came into the prison, but<br>
the living there as he did in a figure like a gentleman, and, which was<br>
ten times as much, the making of friends, and soliciting his case, had<br>
been very expensive; and, in a word, all his stock that he had left was<br>
&pound;108, which he had about him all in gold.<br>
<br>
I gave him an account of my stock as faithfully, that is to say, of<br>
what I had taken to carry with me, for I was resolved, whatever should<br>
happen, to keep what I had left with my governess in reserve; that in<br>
case I should die, what I had with me was enough to give him, and that<br>
which was left in my governess&rsquo;s hands would be her own, which she had<br>
well deserved of me indeed.<br>
<br>
My stock which I had with me was &pound;246 some odd shillings; so that we<br>
had &pound;354 between us, but a worse gotten estate was scarce ever put<br>
together to begin the world with.<br>
<br>
Our greatest misfortune as to our stock was that it was all in money,<br>
which every one knows is an unprofitable cargo to be carried to the<br>
plantations. I believe his was really all he had left in the world, as<br>
he told me it was; but I, who had between &pound;700 and &pound;800 in bank when<br>
this disaster befell me, and who had one of the faithfullest friends in<br>
the world to manage it for me, considering she was a woman of manner of<br>
religious principles, had still &pound;300 left in her hand, which I reserved<br>
as above; besides, some very valuable things, as particularly two gold<br>
watches, some small pieces of plate, and some rings&mdash;all stolen goods.<br>
The plate, rings, and watches were put in my chest with the money, and<br>
with this fortune, and in the sixty-first year of my age, I launched<br>
out into a new world, as I may call it, in the condition (as to what<br>
appeared) only of a poor, naked convict, ordered to be transported in<br>
respite from the gallows. My clothes were poor and mean, but not ragged<br>
or dirty, and none knew in the whole ship that I had anything of value<br>
about me.<br>
<br>
However, as I had a great many very good clothes and linen in<br>
abundance, which I had ordered to be packed up in two great boxes, I<br>
had them shipped on board, not as my goods, but as consigned to my real<br>
name in Virginia; and had the bills of loading signed by a captain in<br>
my pocket; and in these boxes was my plate and watches, and everything<br>
of value except my money, which I kept by itself in a private drawer in<br>
my chest, which could not be found, or opened, if found, without<br>
splitting the chest to pieces.<br>
<br>
In this condition I lay for three weeks in the ship, not knowing<br>
whether I should have my husband with me or no, and therefore not<br>
resolving how or in what manner to receive the honest boatswain&rsquo;s<br>
proposal, which indeed he thought a little strange at first.<br>
<br>
At the end of this time, behold my husband came on board. He looked<br>
with a dejected, angry countenance, his great heart was swelled with<br>
rage and disdain; to be dragged along with three keepers of Newgate,<br>
and put on board like a convict, when he had not so much as been<br>
brought to a trial. He made loud complaints of it by his friends, for<br>
it seems he had some interest; but his friends got some check in their<br>
application, and were told he had had favour enough, and that they had<br>
received such an account of him, since the last grant of his<br>
transportation, that he ought to think himself very well treated that<br>
he was not prosecuted anew. This answer quieted him at once, for he<br>
knew too much what might have happened, and what he had room to expect;<br>
and now he saw the goodness of the advice to him, which prevailed with<br>
him to accept of the offer of a voluntary transportation. And after<br>
this his chagrin at these hell-hounds, as he called them, was a little<br>
over, he looked a little composed, began to be cheerful, and as I was<br>
telling him how glad I was to have him once more out of their hands, he<br>
took me in his arms, and acknowledged with great tenderness that I had<br>
given him the best advice possible. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;thou has twice<br>
saved my life; from henceforward it shall be all employed for you, and<br>
I&rsquo;ll always take your advice.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The ship began now to fill; several passengers came on board, who were<br>
embarked on no criminal account, and these had accommodations assigned<br>
them in the great cabin, and other parts of the ship, whereas we, as<br>
convicts, were thrust down below, I know not where. But when my husband<br>
came on board, I spoke to the boatswain, who had so early given me<br>
hints of his friendship in carrying my letter. I told him he had<br>
befriended me in many things, and I had not made any suitable return to<br>
him, and with that I put a guinea into his hand. I told him that my<br>
husband was now come on board; that though we were both under the<br>
present misfortune, yet we had been persons of a different character<br>
from the wretched crew that we came with, and desired to know of him,<br>
whether the captain might not be moved to admit us to some conveniences<br>
in the ship, for which we would make him what satisfaction he pleased,<br>
and that we would gratify him for his pains in procuring this for us.<br>
He took the guinea, as I could see, with great satisfaction, and<br>
assured me of his assistance.<br>
<br>
Then he told us he did not doubt but that the captain, who was one of<br>
the best-humoured gentlemen in the world, would be easily brought to<br>
accommodate us as well as we could desire, and, to make me easy, told<br>
me he would go up the next tide on purpose to speak to the captain<br>
about it. The next morning, happening to sleep a little longer than<br>
ordinary, when I got up, and began to look abroad, I saw the boatswain<br>
among the men in his ordinary business. I was a little melancholy at<br>
seeing him there, and going forward to speak to him, he saw me, and<br>
came towards me, but not giving him time to speak first, I said,<br>
smiling, &ldquo;I doubt, sir, you have forgot us, for I see you are very<br>
busy.&rdquo; He returned presently, &ldquo;Come along with me, and you shall see.&rdquo;<br>
So he took me into the great cabin, and there sat a good sort of a<br>
gentlemanly man for a seaman, writing, and with a great many papers<br>
before him.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says the boatswain to him that was a-writing, &ldquo;is the<br>
gentlewoman that the captain spoke to you of&rdquo;; and turning to me, he<br>
said, &ldquo;I have been so far from forgetting your business, that I have<br>
been up at the captain&rsquo;s house, and have represented faithfully to the<br>
captain what you said, relating to you being furnished with better<br>
conveniences for yourself and your husband; and the captain has sent<br>
this gentleman, who is mate of the ship, down with me, on purpose to<br>
show you everything, and to accommodate you fully to your content, and<br>
bid me assure you that you shall not be treated like what you were at<br>
first expected to be, but with the same respect as other passengers are<br>
treated.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
The mate then spoke to me, and, not giving me time to thank the<br>
boatswain for his kindness, confirmed what the boatswain had said, and<br>
added that it was the captain&rsquo;s delight to show himself kind and<br>
charitable, especially to those that were under any misfortunes, and<br>
with that he showed me several cabins built up, some in the great<br>
cabin, and some partitioned off, out of the steerage, but opening into<br>
the great cabin on purpose for the accommodation of passengers, and<br>
gave me leave to choose where I would. However, I chose a cabin which<br>
opened into the steerage, in which was very good conveniences to set<br>
our chest and boxes, and a table to eat on.<br>
<br>
The mate then told me that the boatswain had given so good a character<br>
of me and my husband, as to our civil behaviour, that he had orders to<br>
tell me we should eat with him, if we thought fit, during the whole<br>
voyage, on the common terms of passengers; that we might lay in some<br>
fresh provisions, if we pleased; or if not, he should lay in his usual<br>
store, and we should have share with him. This was very reviving news<br>
to me, after so many hardships and afflictions as I had gone through of<br>
late. I thanked him, and told him the captain should make his own terms<br>
with us, and asked him leave to go and tell my husband of it, who was<br>
not very well, and was not yet out of his cabin. Accordingly I went,<br>
and my husband, whose spirits were still so much sunk with the<br>
indignity (as he understood it) offered him, that he was scarce yet<br>
himself, was so revived with the account that I gave him of the<br>
reception we were like to have in the ship, that he was quite another<br>
man, and new vigour and courage appeared in his very countenance. So<br>
true is it, that the greatest of spirits, when overwhelmed by their<br>
afflictions, are subject to the greatest dejections, and are the most<br>
apt to despair and give themselves up.<br>
<br>
After some little pause to recover himself, my husband came up with me,<br>
and gave the mate thanks for the kindness, which he had expressed to<br>
us, and sent suitable acknowledgment by him to the captain, offering to<br>
pay him by advance, whatever he demanded for our passage, and for the<br>
conveniences he had helped us to. The mate told him that the captain<br>
would be on board in the afternoon, and that he would leave all that<br>
till he came. Accordingly, in the afternoon the captain came, and we<br>
found him the same courteous, obliging man that the boatswain had<br>
represented him to be; and he was so well pleased with my husband&rsquo;s<br>
conversation, that, in short, he would not let us keep the cabin we had<br>
chosen, but gave us one that, as I said before, opened into the great<br>
cabin.<br>
<br>
Nor were his conditions exorbitant, or the man craving and eager to<br>
make a prey of us, but for fifteen guineas we had our whole passage and<br>
provisions and cabin, ate at the captain&rsquo;s table, and were very<br>
handsomely entertained.<br>
<br>
The captain lay himself in the other part of the great cabin, having<br>
let his round house, as they call it, to a rich planter who went over<br>
with his wife and three children, who ate by themselves. He had some<br>
other ordinary passengers, who quartered in the steerage, and as for<br>
our old fraternity, they were kept under the hatches while the ship lay<br>
there, and came very little on the deck.<br>
<br>
I could not refrain acquainting my governess with what had happened; it<br>
was but just that she, who was so really concerned for me, should have<br>
part in my good fortune. Besides, I wanted her assistance to supply me<br>
with several necessaries, which before I was shy of letting anybody see<br>
me have, that it might not be public; but now I had a cabin and room to<br>
set things in, I ordered abundance of good things for our comfort in<br>
the voyage, as brandy, sugar, lemons, etc., to make punch, and treat<br>
our benefactor, the captain; and abundance of things for eating and<br>
drinking in the voyage; also a larger bed, and bedding proportioned to<br>
it; so that, in a word, we resolved to want for nothing in the voyage.<br>
<br>
All this while I had provided nothing for our assistance when we should<br>
come to the place and begin to call ourselves planters; and I was far<br>
from being ignorant of what was needful on that occasion; particularly<br>
all sorts of tools for the planter&rsquo;s work, and for building; and all<br>
kinds of furniture for our dwelling, which, if to be bought in the<br>
country, must necessarily cost double the price.<br>
<br>
So I discoursed that point with my governess, and she went and waited<br>
upon the captain, and told him that she hoped ways might be found out<br>
for her two unfortunate cousins, as she called us, to obtain our<br>
freedom when we came into the country, and so entered into a discourse<br>
with him about the means and terms also, of which I shall say more in<br>
its place; and after thus sounding the captain, she let him know,<br>
though we were unhappy in the circumstances that occasioned our going,<br>
yet that we were not unfurnished to set ourselves to work in the<br>
country, and we resolved to settle and live there as planters, if we<br>
might be put in a way how to do it. The captain readily offered his<br>
assistance, told her the method of entering upon such business, and how<br>
easy, nay, how certain it was for industrious people to recover their<br>
fortunes in such a manner. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis no reproach to any<br>
many in that country to have been sent over in worse circumstances than<br>
I perceive your cousins are in, provided they do but apply with<br>
diligence and good judgment to the business of that place when they<br>
come there.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
She then inquired of him what things it was necessary we should carry<br>
over with us, and he, like a very honest as well as knowing man, told<br>
her thus: &ldquo;Madam, your cousins in the first place must procure somebody<br>
to buy them as servants, in conformity to the conditions of their<br>
transportation, and then, in the name of that person, they may go about<br>
what they will; they may either purchase some plantations already<br>
begun, or they may purchase land of the Government of the country, and<br>
begin where they please, and both will be done reasonably.&rdquo; She bespoke<br>
his favour in the first article, which he promised to her to take upon<br>
himself, and indeed faithfully performed it, and as to the rest, he<br>
promised to recommend us to such as should give us the best advice, and<br>
not to impose upon us, which was as much as could be desired.<br>
<br>
She then asked him if it would not be necessary to furnish us with a<br>
stock of tools and materials for the business of planting, and he said,<br>
&ldquo;Yes, by all means.&rdquo; And then she begged his assistance in it. She told<br>
him she would furnish us with everything that was convenient whatever<br>
it cost her. He accordingly gave her a long particular of things<br>
necessary for a planter, which, by his account, came to about fourscore<br>
or a hundred pounds. And, in short, she went about as dexterously to<br>
buy them, as if she had been an old Virginia merchant; only that she<br>
bought, by my direction, above twice as much of everything as he had<br>
given her a list of.<br>
<br>
These she put on board in her own name, took his bills of loading for<br>
them, and endorsed those bills of loading to my husband, insuring the<br>
cargo afterwards in her own name, by our order; so that we were<br>
provided for all events, and for all disasters.<br>
<br>
I should have told you that my husband gave her all his whole stock of<br>
&pound;108, which, as I have said, he had about him in gold, to lay out thus,<br>
and I gave her a good sum besides; so that I did not break into the<br>
stock which I had left in her hands at all, but after we had sorted out<br>
our whole cargo, we had yet near &pound;200 in money, which was more than<br>
enough for our purpose.<br>
<br>
In this condition, very cheerful, and indeed joyful at being so happily<br>
accommodated as we were, we set sail from Bugby&rsquo;s Hole to Gravesend,<br>
where the ship lay about ten more days, and where the captain came on<br>
board for good and all. Here the captain offered us a civility, which<br>
indeed we had no reason to expect, namely, to let us go on shore and<br>
refresh ourselves, upon giving our words in a solemn manner that we<br>
would not go from him, and that we would return peaceably on board<br>
again. This was such an evidence of his confidence in us, that it<br>
overcame my husband, who, in a mere principle of gratitude, told him,<br>
as he could not be in any capacity to make a suitable return for such a<br>
favour, so he could not think of accepting of it, nor could he be easy<br>
that the captain should run such a risk. After some mutual civilities,<br>
I gave my husband a purse, in which was eighty guineas, and he put in<br>
into the captain&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;There, captain,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s part of a<br>
pledge for our fidelity; if we deal dishonestly with you on any<br>
account, &rsquo;tis your own.&rdquo; And on this we went on shore.<br>
<br>
Indeed, the captain had assurance enough of our resolutions to go, for<br>
that having made such provision to settle there, it did not seem<br>
rational that we would choose to remain here at the expense and peril<br>
of life, for such it must have been if we had been taken again. In a<br>
word, we went all on shore with the captain, and supped together in<br>
Gravesend, where we were very merry, stayed all night, lay at the house<br>
where we supped, and came all very honestly on board again with him in<br>
the morning. Here we bought ten dozen bottles of good beer, some wine,<br>
some fowls, and such things as we thought might be acceptable on board.<br>
<br>
My governess was with us all this while, and went with us round into<br>
the Downs, as did also the captain&rsquo;s wife, with whom she went back. I<br>
was never so sorrowful at parting with my own mother as I was at<br>
parting with her, and I never saw her more. We had a fair easterly wind<br>
sprung up the third day after we came to the Downs, and we sailed from<br>
thence the 10th of April. Nor did we touch any more at any place, till,<br>
being driven on the coast of Ireland by a very hard gale of wind, the<br>
ship came to an anchor in a little bay, near the mouth of a river,<br>
whose name I remember not, but they said the river came down from<br>
Limerick, and that it was the largest river in Ireland.<br>
<br>
Here, being detained by bad weather for some time, the captain, who<br>
continued the same kind, good-humoured man as at first, took us two on<br>
shore with him again. He did it now in kindness to my husband indeed,<br>
who bore the sea very ill, and was very sick, especially when it blew<br>
so hard. Here we bought in again a store of fresh provisions,<br>
especially beef, pork, mutton, and fowls, and the captain stayed to<br>
pickle up five or six barrels of beef to lengthen out the ship&rsquo;s store.<br>
We were here not above five days, when the weather turning mild, and a<br>
fair wind, we set sail again, and in two-and-forty days came safe to<br>
the coast of Virginia.<br>
<br>
When we drew near to the shore, the captain called me to him, and told<br>
me that he found by my discourse I had some relations in the place, and<br>
that I had been there before, and so he supposed I understood the<br>
custom in their disposing the convict prisoners when they arrived. I<br>
told him I did not, and that as to what relations I had in the place,<br>
he might be sure I would make myself known to none of them while I was<br>
in the circumstances of a prisoner, and that as to the rest, we left<br>
ourselves entirely to him to assist us, as he was pleased to promise us<br>
he would do. He told me I must get somebody in the place to come and<br>
buy us as servants, and who must answer for us to the governor of the<br>
country, if he demanded us. I told him we should do as he should<br>
direct; so he brought a planter to treat with him, as it were, for the<br>
purchase of these two servants, my husband and me, and there we were<br>
formally sold to him, and went ashore with him. The captain went with<br>
us, and carried us to a certain house, whether it was to be called a<br>
tavern or not I know not, but we had a bowl of punch there made of rum,<br>
etc., and were very merry. After some time the planter gave us a<br>
certificate of discharge, and an acknowledgment of having served him<br>
faithfully, and we were free from him the next morning, to go wither we<br>
would.<br>
<br>
For this piece of service the captain demanded of us six thousand<br>
weight of tabacco, which he said he was accountable for to his<br>
freighter, and which we immediately bought for him, and made him a<br>
present of twenty guineas besides, with which he was abundantly<br>
satisfied.<br>
<br>
It is not proper to enter here into the particulars of what part of the<br>
colony of Virginia we settled in, for divers reasons; it may suffice to<br>
mention that we went into the great river Potomac, the ship being bound<br>
thither; and there we intended to have settled first, though afterwards<br>
we altered our minds.<br>
<br>
The first thing I did of moment after having gotten all our goods on<br>
shore, and placed them in a storehouse, or warehouse, which, with a<br>
lodging, we hired at the small place or village where we landed&mdash;I say,<br>
the first thing was to inquire after my mother, and after my brother<br>
(that fatal person whom I married as a husband, as I have related at<br>
large). A little inquiry furnished me with information that Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;,<br>
that is, my mother, was dead; that my brother (or husband) was alive,<br>
which I confess I was not very glad to hear; but which was worse, I<br>
found he was removed from the plantation where he lived formerly, and<br>
where I lived with him, and lived with one of his sons in a plantation<br>
just by the place where we landed, and where we had hired a warehouse.<br>
<br>
I was a little surprised at first, but as I ventured to satisfy myself<br>
that he could not know me, I was not only perfectly easy, but had a<br>
great mind to see him, if it was possible to so do without his seeing<br>
me. In order to that I found out by inquiry the plantation where he<br>
lived, and with a woman of that place whom I got to help me, like what<br>
we call a chairwoman, I rambled about towards the place as if I had<br>
only a mind to see the country and look about me. At last I came so<br>
near that I saw the dwellinghouse. I asked the woman whose plantation<br>
that was; she said it belonged to such a man, and looking out a little<br>
to our right hands, &ldquo;there,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;is the gentleman that owns the<br>
plantation, and his father with him.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are their Christian names?&rdquo;<br>
said I. &ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;what the old gentleman&rsquo;s name is, but<br>
the son&rsquo;s name is Humphrey; and I believe,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;the father&rsquo;s is<br>
so too.&rdquo; You may guess, if you can, what a confused mixture of joy and<br>
fight possessed my thoughts upon this occasion, for I immediately knew<br>
that this was nobody else but my own son, by that father she showed me,<br>
who was my own brother. I had no mask, but I ruffled my hood so about<br>
my face, that I depended upon it that after above twenty years&rsquo;<br>
absence, and withal not expecting anything of me in that part of the<br>
world, he would not be able to know anything of me. But I need not have<br>
used all that caution, for the old gentleman was grown dim-sighted by<br>
some distemper which had fallen upon his eyes, and could but just see<br>
well enough to walk about, and not run against a tree or into a ditch.<br>
The woman that was with me had told me that by a mere accident, knowing<br>
nothing of what importance it was to me. As they drew near to us, I<br>
said, &ldquo;Does he know you, Mrs. Owen?&rdquo; (so they called the woman). &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;<br>
said she, &ldquo;if he hears me speak, he will know me; but he can&rsquo;t see well<br>
enough to know me or anybody else&rdquo;; and so she told me the story of his<br>
sight, as I have related. This made me secure, and so I threw open my<br>
hoods again, and let them pass by me. It was a wretched thing for a<br>
mother thus to see her own son, a handsome, comely young gentleman in<br>
flourishing circumstances, and durst not make herself known to him, and<br>
durst not take any notice of him. Let any mother of children that reads<br>
this consider it, and but think with what anguish of mind I restrained<br>
myself; what yearnings of soul I had in me to embrace him, and weep<br>
over him; and how I thought all my entrails turned within me, that my<br>
very bowels moved, and I knew not what to do, as I now know not how to<br>
express those agonies! When he went from me I stood gazing and<br>
trembling, and looking after him as long as I could see him; then<br>
sitting down to rest me, but turned from her, and lying on my face,<br>
wept, and kissed the ground that he had set his foot on.<br>
<br>
I could not conceal my disorder so much from the woman but that she<br>
perceived it, and thought I was not well, which I was obliged to<br>
pretend was true; upon which she pressed me to rise, the ground being<br>
damp and dangerous, which I did accordingly, and walked away.<br>
<br>
As I was going back again, and still talking of this gentleman and his<br>
son, a new occasion of melancholy offered itself thus. The woman began,<br>
as if she would tell me a story to divert me: &ldquo;There goes,&rdquo; says she,<br>
&ldquo;a very odd tale among the neighbours where this gentleman formerly<br>
live.&rdquo; &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;that old gentleman<br>
going to England, when he was a young man, fell in love with a young<br>
lady there, one of the finest women that ever was seen, and married<br>
her, and brought her over hither to his mother who was then living. He<br>
lived here several years with her,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;and had several<br>
children by her, of which the young gentleman that was with him now was<br>
one; but after some time, the old gentlewoman, his mother, talking to<br>
her of something relating to herself when she was in England, and of<br>
her circumstances in England, which were bad enough, the<br>
daughter-in-law began to be very much surprised and uneasy; and, in<br>
short, examining further into things, it appeared past all<br>
contradiction that the old gentlewoman was her own mother, and that<br>
consequently that son was his wife&rsquo;s own brother, which struck the<br>
whole family with horror, and put them into such confusion that it had<br>
almost ruined them all. The young woman would not live with him; the<br>
son, her brother and husband, for a time went distracted; and at last<br>
the young woman went away for England, and has never been heard of<br>
since.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
It is easy to believe that I was strangely affected with this story,<br>
but &rsquo;tis impossible to describe the nature of my disturbance. I seemed<br>
astonished at the story, and asked her a thousand questions about the<br>
particulars, which I found she was thoroughly acquainted with. At last<br>
I began to inquire into the circumstances of the family, how the old<br>
gentlewoman, I mean my mother, died, and how she left what she had; for<br>
my mother had promised me very solemnly, that when she died she would<br>
do something for me, and leave it so, as that, if I was living, I<br>
should one way or other come at it, without its being in the power of<br>
her son, my brother and husband, to prevent it. She told me she did not<br>
know exactly how it was ordered, but she had been told that my mother<br>
had left a sum of money, and had tied her plantation for the payment of<br>
it, to be made good to the daughter, if ever she could be heard of,<br>
either in England or elsewhere; and that the trust was left with this<br>
son, who was the person that we saw with his father.<br>
<br>
This was news too good for me to make light of, and, you may be sure,<br>
filled my heart with a thousand thoughts, what course I should take,<br>
how, and when, and in what manner I should make myself known, or<br>
whether I should ever make myself know or no.<br>
<br>
Here was a perplexity that I had not indeed skill to manage myself in,<br>
neither knew I what course to take. It lay heavy upon my mind night and<br>
day. I could neither sleep nor converse, so that my husband perceived<br>
it, and wondered what ailed me, strove to divert me, but it was all to<br>
no purpose. He pressed me to tell him what it was troubled me, but I<br>
put it off, till at last, importuning me continually, I was forced to<br>
form a story, which yet had a plain truth to lay it upon too. I told<br>
him I was troubled because I found we must shift our quarters and alter<br>
our scheme of settling, for that I found I should be known if I stayed<br>
in that part of the country; for that my mother being dead, several of<br>
my relations were come into that part where we then was, and that I<br>
must either discover myself to them, which in our present circumstances<br>
was not proper on many accounts, or remove; and which to do I knew not,<br>
and that this it was that made me so melancholy and so thoughtful.<br>
<br>
He joined with me in this, that it was by no means proper for me to<br>
make myself known to anybody in the circumstances in which we then<br>
were; and therefore he told me he would be willing to remove to any<br>
other part of the country, or even to any other country if I thought<br>
fit. But now I had another difficulty, which was, that if I removed to<br>
any other colony, I put myself out of the way of ever making a due<br>
search after those effects which my mother had left. Again I could<br>
never so much as think of breaking the secret of my former marriage to<br>
my new husband; it was not a story, as I thought, that would bear<br>
telling, nor could I tell what might be the consequences of it; and it<br>
was impossible to search into the bottom of the thing without making it<br>
public all over the country, as well who I was, as what I now was also.<br>
<br>
In this perplexity I continued a great while, and this made my spouse<br>
very uneasy; for he found me perplexed, and yet thought I was not open<br>
with him, and did not let him into every part of my grievance; and he<br>
would often say, he wondered what he had done that I would not trust<br>
him with whatever it was, especially if it was grievous and afflicting.<br>
The truth is, he ought to have been trusted with everything, for no man<br>
in the world could deserve better of a wife; but this was a thing I<br>
knew not how to open to him, and yet having nobody to disclose any part<br>
of it to, the burthen was too heavy for my mind; for let them say what<br>
they please of our sex not being able to keep a secret, my life is a<br>
plain conviction to me of the contrary; but be it our sex, or the man&rsquo;s<br>
sex, a secret of moment should always have a confidant, a bosom friend,<br>
to whom we may communicate the joy of it, or the grief of it, be it<br>
which it will, or it will be a double weight upon the spirits, and<br>
perhaps become even insupportable in itself; and this I appeal to all<br>
human testimony for the truth of.<br>
<br>
And this is the cause why many times men as well as women, and men of<br>
the greatest and best qualities other ways, yet have found themselves<br>
weak in this part, and have not been able to bear the weight of a<br>
secret joy or of a secret sorrow, but have been obliged to disclose it,<br>
even for the mere giving vent to themselves, and to unbend the mind<br>
oppressed with the load and weights which attended it. Nor was this any<br>
token of folly or thoughtlessness at all, but a natural consequence of<br>
the thing; and such people, had they struggled longer with the<br>
oppression, would certainly have told it in their sleep, and disclosed<br>
the secret, let it have been of what fatal nature soever, without<br>
regard to the person to whom it might be exposed. This necessity of<br>
nature is a thing which works sometimes with such vehemence in the<br>
minds of those who are guilty of any atrocious villainy, such as secret<br>
murder in particular, that they have been obliged to discover it,<br>
though the consequence would necessarily be their own destruction. Now,<br>
though it may be true that the divine justice ought to have the glory<br>
of all those discoveries and confessions, yet &rsquo;tis as certain that<br>
Providence, which ordinarily works by the hands of nature, makes use<br>
here of the same natural causes to produce those extraordinary effects.<br>
<br>
I could give several remarkable instances of this in my long<br>
conversation with crime and with criminals. I knew one fellow that,<br>
while I was in prison in Newgate, was one of those they called then<br>
night-fliers. I know not what other word they may have understood it by<br>
since, but he was one who by connivance was admitted to go abroad every<br>
evening, when he played his pranks, and furnished those honest people<br>
they call thief-catchers with business to find out the next day, and<br>
restore for a reward what they had stolen the evening before. This<br>
fellow was as sure to tell in his sleep all that he had done, and every<br>
step he had taken, what he had stolen, and where, as sure as if he had<br>
engaged to tell it waking, and that there was no harm or danger in it,<br>
and therefore he was obliged, after he had been out, to lock himself<br>
up, or be locked up by some of the keepers that had him in fee, that<br>
nobody should hear him; but, on the other hand, if he had told all the<br>
particulars, and given a full account of his rambles and success, to<br>
any comrade, any brother thief, or to his employers, as I may justly<br>
call them, then all was well with him, and he slept as quietly as other<br>
people.<br>
<br>
As the publishing this account of my life is for the sake of the just<br>
moral of very part of it, and for instruction, caution, warning, and<br>
improvement to every reader, so this will not pass, I hope, for an<br>
unnecessary digression concerning some people being obliged to disclose<br>
the greatest secrets either of their own or other people&rsquo;s affairs.<br>
<br>
Under the certain oppression of this weight upon my mind, I laboured in<br>
the case I have been naming; and the only relief I found for it was to<br>
let my husband into so much of it as I thought would convince him of<br>
the necessity there was for us to think of settling in some other part<br>
of the world; and the next consideration before us was, which part of<br>
the English settlements we should go to. My husband was a perfect<br>
stranger to the country, and had not yet so much as a geographical<br>
knowledge of the situation of the several places; and I, that, till I<br>
wrote this, did not know what the word geographical signified, had only<br>
a general knowledge from long conversation with people that came from<br>
or went to several places; but this I knew, that Maryland,<br>
Pennsylvania, East and West Jersey, New York, and New England lay all<br>
north of Virginia, and that they were consequently all colder climates,<br>
to which for that very reason, I had an aversion. For that as I<br>
naturally loved warm weather, so now I grew into years I had a stronger<br>
inclination to shun a cold climate. I therefore considered of going to<br>
Carolina, which is the only southern colony of the English on the<br>
continent of America, and hither I proposed to go; and the rather<br>
because I might with great ease come from thence at any time, when it<br>
might be proper to inquire after my mother&rsquo;s effects, and to make<br>
myself known enough to demand them.<br>
<br>
With this resolution I proposed to my husband our going away from where<br>
we was, and carrying all our effects with us to Carolina, where we<br>
resolved to settle; for my husband readily agreed to the first part,<br>
viz. that was not at all proper to stay where we was, since I had<br>
assured him we should be known there, and the rest I effectually<br>
concealed from him.<br>
<br>
But now I found a new difficulty upon me. The main affair grew heavy<br>
upon my mind still, and I could not think of going out of the country<br>
without somehow or other making inquiry into the grand affair of what<br>
my mother had done for me; nor could I with any patience bear the<br>
thought of going away, and not make myself known to my old husband<br>
(brother), or to my child, his son; only I would fain have had this<br>
done without my new husband having any knowledge of it, or they having<br>
any knowledge of him, or that I had such a thing as a husband.<br>
<br>
I cast about innumerable ways in my thoughts how this might be done. I<br>
would gladly have sent my husband away to Carolina with all our goods,<br>
and have come after myself, but this was impracticable; he would never<br>
stir without me, being himself perfectly unacquainted with the country,<br>
and with the methods of settling there or anywhere else. Then I thought<br>
we would both go first with part of our goods, and that when we were<br>
settled I should come back to Virginia and fetch the remainder; but<br>
even then I knew he would never part with me, and be left there to go<br>
on alone. The case was plain; he was bred a gentleman, and by<br>
consequence was not only unacquainted, but indolent, and when we did<br>
settle, would much rather go out into the woods with his gun, which<br>
they call there hunting, and which is the ordinary work of the Indians,<br>
and which they do as servants; I say, he would rather do that than<br>
attend the natural business of his plantation.<br>
<br>
These were therefore difficulties insurmountable, and such as I knew<br>
not what to do in. I had such strong impressions on my mind about<br>
discovering myself to my brother, formerly my husband, that I could not<br>
withstand them; and the rather, because it ran constantly in my<br>
thoughts, that if I did not do it while he lived, I might in vain<br>
endeavour to convince my son afterward that I was really the same<br>
person, and that I was his mother, and so might both lose the<br>
assistance and comfort of the relation, and the benefit of whatever it<br>
was my mother had left me; and yet, on the other hand, I could never<br>
think it proper to discover myself to them in the circumstances I was<br>
in, as well relating to the having a husband with me as to my being<br>
brought over by a legal transportation as a criminal; on both which<br>
accounts it was absolutely necessary to me to remove from the place<br>
where I was, and come again to him, as from another place and in<br>
another figure.<br>
<br>
Upon those considerations, I went on with telling my husband the<br>
absolute necessity there was of our not settling in Potomac River, at<br>
least that we should be presently made public there; whereas if we went<br>
to any other place in the world, we should come in with as much<br>
reputation as any family that came to plant; that, as it was always<br>
agreeable to the inhabitants to have families come among them to plant,<br>
who brought substance with them, either to purchase plantations or<br>
begin new ones, so we should be sure of a kind, agreeable reception,<br>
and that without any possibility of a discovery of our circumstances.<br>
<br>
I told him in general, too, that as I had several relations in the<br>
place where we were, and that I durst not now let myself be known to<br>
them, because they would soon come into a knowledge of the occasion and<br>
reason of my coming over, which would be to expose myself to the last<br>
degree, so I had reason to believe that my mother, who died here, had<br>
left me something, and perhaps considerable, which it might be very<br>
well worth my while to inquire after; but that this too could not be<br>
done without exposing us publicly, unless we went from hence; and then,<br>
wherever we settled, I might come, as it were, to visit and to see my<br>
brother and nephews, make myself known to them, claim and inquire after<br>
what was my due, be received with respect, and at the same time have<br>
justice done me with cheerfulness and good will; whereas, if I did it<br>
now, I could expect nothing but with trouble, such as exacting it by<br>
force, receiving it with curses and reluctance, and with all kinds of<br>
affronts, which he would not perhaps bear to see; that in case of being<br>
obliged to legal proofs of being really her daughter, I might be at<br>
loss, be obliged to have recourse to England, and it may be to fail at<br>
last, and so lose it, whatever it might be. With these arguments, and<br>
having thus acquainted my husband with the whole secret so far as was<br>
needful of him, we resolved to go and seek a settlement in some other<br>
colony, and at first thoughts, Carolina was the place we pitched upon.<br>
<br>
In order to this we began to make inquiry for vessels going to<br>
Carolina, and in a very little while got information, that on the other<br>
side the bay, as they call it, namely, in Maryland, there was a ship<br>
which came from Carolina, laden with rice and other goods, and was<br>
going back again thither, and from thence to Jamaica, with provisions.<br>
On this news we hired a sloop to take in our goods, and taking, as it<br>
were, a final farewell of Potomac River, we went with all our cargo<br>
over to Maryland.<br>
<br>
This was a long and unpleasant voyage, and my spouse said it was worse<br>
to him than all the voyage from England, because the weather was but<br>
indifferent, the water rough, and the vessel small and inconvenient. In<br>
the next place, we were full a hundred miles up Potomac River, in a<br>
part which they call Westmoreland County, and as that river is by far<br>
the greatest in Virginia, and I have heard say it is the greatest river<br>
in the world that falls into another river, and not directly into the<br>
sea, so we had base weather in it, and were frequently in great danger;<br>
for though we were in the middle, we could not see land on either side<br>
for many leagues together. Then we had the great river or bay of<br>
Chesapeake to cross, which is where the river Potomac falls into it,<br>
near thirty miles broad, and we entered more great vast waters whose<br>
names I know not, so that our voyage was full two hundred miles, in a<br>
poor, sorry sloop, with all our treasure, and if any accident had<br>
happened to us, we might at last have been very miserable; supposing we<br>
had lost our goods and saved our lives only, and had then been left<br>
naked and destitute, and in a wild, strange place not having one friend<br>
or acquaintance in all that part of the world. The very thought of it<br>
gives me some horror, even since the danger is past.<br>
<br>
Well, we came to the place in five days&rsquo; sailing; I think they call it<br>
Philip&rsquo;s Point; and behold, when we came thither, the ship bound to<br>
Carolina was loaded and gone away but three days before. This was a<br>
disappointment; but, however, I, that was to be discouraged with<br>
nothing, told my husband that since we could not get passage to<br>
Carolina, and that the country we was in was very fertile and good, we<br>
would, if he liked of it, see if we could find out anything for our<br>
tune where we was, and that if he liked things we would settle here.<br>
<br>
We immediately went on shore, but found no conveniences just at that<br>
place, either for our being on shore or preserving our goods on shore,<br>
but was directed by a very honest Quaker, whom we found there, to go to<br>
a place about sixty miles east; that is to say, nearer the mouth of the<br>
bay, where he said he lived, and where we should be accommodated,<br>
either to plant, or to wait for any other place to plant in that might<br>
be more convenient; and he invited us with so much kindness and simple<br>
honesty, that we agreed to go, and the Quaker himself went with us.<br>
<br>
Here we bought us two servants, viz. an English woman-servant just come<br>
on shore from a ship of Liverpool, and a Negro man-servant, things<br>
absolutely necessary for all people that pretended to settle in that<br>
country. This honest Quaker was very helpful to us, and when we came to<br>
the place that he proposed to us, found us out a convenient storehouse<br>
for our goods, and lodging for ourselves and our servants; and about<br>
two months or thereabouts afterwards, by his direction, we took up a<br>
large piece of land from the governor of that country, in order to form<br>
our plantation, and so we laid the thoughts of going to Carolina wholly<br>
aside, having been very well received here, and accommodated with a<br>
convenient lodging till we could prepare things, and have land enough<br>
cleared, and timber and materials provided for building us a house, all<br>
which we managed by the direction of the Quaker; so that in one year&rsquo;s<br>
time we had nearly fifty acres of land cleared, part of it enclosed,<br>
and some of it planted with tabacco, though not much; besides, we had<br>
garden ground and corn sufficient to help supply our servants with<br>
roots and herbs and bread.<br>
<br>
And now I persuaded my husband to let me go over the bay again, and<br>
inquire after my friends. He was the willinger to consent to it now,<br>
because he had business upon his hands sufficient to employ him,<br>
besides his gun to divert him, which they call hunting there, and which<br>
he greatly delighted in; and indeed we used to look at one another,<br>
sometimes with a great deal of pleasure, reflecting how much better<br>
that was, not than Newgate only, but than the most prosperous of our<br>
circumstances in the wicked trade that we had been both carrying on.<br>
<br>
Our affair was in a very good posture; we purchased of the proprietors<br>
of the colony as much land for &pound;35, paid in ready money, as would make<br>
a sufficient plantation to employ between fifty and sixty servants, and<br>
which, being well improved, would be sufficient to us as long as we<br>
could either of us live; and as for children, I was past the prospect<br>
of anything of that kind.<br>
<br>
But out good fortune did not end here. I went, as I have said, over the<br>
bay, to the place where my brother, once a husband, lived; but I did<br>
not go to the same village where I was before, but went up another<br>
great river, on the east side of the river Potomac, called Rappahannock<br>
River, and by this means came on the back of his plantation, which was<br>
large, and by the help of a navigable creek, or little river, that ran<br>
into the Rappahannock, I came very near it.<br>
<br>
I was now fully resolved to go up point-blank to my brother (husband),<br>
and to tell him who I was; but not knowing what temper I might find him<br>
in, or how much out of temper rather, I might make him by such a rash<br>
visit, I resolved to write a letter to him first, to let him know who I<br>
was, and that I was come not to give him any trouble upon the old<br>
relation, which I hoped was entirely forgot, but that I applied to him<br>
as a sister to a brother, desiring his assistance in the case of that<br>
provision which our mother, at her decease, had left for my support,<br>
and which I did not doubt but he would do me justice in, especially<br>
considering that I was come thus far to look after it.<br>
<br>
I said some very tender, kind things in the letter about his son, which<br>
I told him he knew to be my own child, and that as I was guilty of<br>
nothing in marrying him, any more than he was in marrying me, neither<br>
of us having then known our being at all related to one another, so I<br>
hoped he would allow me the most passionate desire of once seeing my<br>
one and only child, and of showing something of the infirmities of a<br>
mother in preserving a violent affect for him, who had never been able<br>
to retain any thought of me one way or other.<br>
<br>
I did believe that, having received this letter, he would immediately<br>
give it to his son to read, I having understood his eyes being so dim,<br>
that he could not see to read it; but it fell out better than so, for<br>
as his sight was dim, so he had allowed his son to open all letters<br>
that came to his hand for him, and the old gentleman being from home,<br>
or out of the way when my messenger came, my letter came directly to my<br>
son&rsquo;s hand, and he opened and read it.<br>
<br>
He called the messenger in, after some little stay, and asked him where<br>
the person was who gave him the letter. The messenger told him the<br>
place, which was about seven miles off, so he bid him stay, and<br>
ordering a horse to be got ready, and two servants, away he came to me<br>
with the messenger. Let any one judge the consternation I was in when<br>
my messenger came back, and told me the old gentleman was not at home,<br>
but his son was come along with him, and was just coming up to me. I<br>
was perfectly confounded, for I knew not whether it was peace or war,<br>
nor could I tell how to behave; however, I had but a very few moments<br>
to think, for my son was at the heels of the messenger, and coming up<br>
into my lodgings, asked the fellow at the door something. I suppose it<br>
was, for I did not hear it so as to understand it, which was the<br>
gentlewoman that sent him; for the messenger said, &ldquo;There she is, sir&rdquo;;<br>
at which he comes directly up to me, kisses me, took me in his arms,<br>
and embraced me with so much passion that he could not speak, but I<br>
could feel his breast heave and throb like a child, that cries, but<br>
sobs, and cannot cry it out.<br>
<br>
I can neither express nor describe the joy that touched my very soul<br>
when I found, for it was easy to discover that part, that he came not<br>
as a stranger, but as a son to a mother, and indeed as a son who had<br>
never before known what a mother of his own was; in short, we cried<br>
over one another a considerable while, when at last he broke out first.<br>
&ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are you still alive? I never expected to<br>
have seen your face.&rdquo; As for me, I could say nothing a great while.<br>
<br>
After we had both recovered ourselves a little, and were able to talk,<br>
he told me how things stood. As to what I had written to his father, he<br>
told me he had not showed my letter to his father, or told him anything<br>
about it; that what his grandmother left me was in his hands, and that<br>
he would do me justice to my full satisfaction; that as to his father,<br>
he was old and infirm both in body and mind; that he was very fretful<br>
and passionate, almost blind, and capable of nothing; and he questioned<br>
whether he would know how to act in an affair which was of so nice a<br>
nature as this; and that therefore he had come himself, as well to<br>
satisfy himself in seeing me, which he could not restrain himself from,<br>
as also to put it into my power to make a judgment, after I had seen<br>
how things were, whether I would discover myself to his father or no.<br>
<br>
This was really so prudently and wisely managed, that I found my son<br>
was a man of sense, and needed no direction from me. I told him I did<br>
not wonder that his father was as he had described him, for that his<br>
head was a little touched before I went away; and principally his<br>
disturbance was because I could not be persuaded to conceal our<br>
relation and to live with him as my husband, after I knew that he was<br>
my brother; that as he knew better than I what his father&rsquo;s present<br>
condition was, I should readily join with him in such measure as he<br>
would direct; that I was indifferent as to seeing his father, since I<br>
had seen him first, and he could not have told me better news than to<br>
tell me that what his grandmother had left me was entrusted in his<br>
hands, who, I doubted not, now he knew who I was, would, as he said, do<br>
me justice. I inquired then how long my mother had been dead, and where<br>
she died, and told so many particulars of the family, that I left him<br>
no room to doubt the truth of my being really and truly his mother.<br>
<br>
My son then inquired where I was, and how I had disposed myself. I told<br>
him I was on the Maryland side of the bay, at the plantation of a<br>
particular friend who came from England in the same ship with me; that<br>
as for that side of the bay where he was, I had no habitation. He told<br>
me I should go home with him, and live with him, if I pleased, as long<br>
as I lived; that as to his father, he knew nobody, and would never so<br>
much as guess at me. I considered of that a little, and told him, that<br>
though it was really no concern to me to live at a distance from him,<br>
yet I could not say it would be the most comfortable thing in the world<br>
to me to live in the house with him, and to have that unhappy object<br>
always before me, which had been such a blow to my peace before; that<br>
though I should be glad to have his company (my son), or to be as near<br>
him as possible while I stayed, yet I could not think of being in the<br>
house where I should be also under constant restraint for fear of<br>
betraying myself in my discourse, nor should I be able to refrain some<br>
expressions in my conversing with him as my son, that might discover<br>
the whole affair, which would by no means be convenient.<br>
<br>
He acknowledged that I was right in all this. &ldquo;But then, dear mother,&rdquo;<br>
says he, &ldquo;you shall be as near me as you can.&rdquo; So he took me with him<br>
on horseback to a plantation next to his own, and where I was as well<br>
entertained as I could have been in his own. Having left me there he<br>
went away home, telling me we would talk of the main business the next<br>
day; and having first called me his aunt, and given a charge to the<br>
people, who it seems were his tenants, to treat me with all possible<br>
respect. About two hours after he was gone, he sent me a maid-servant<br>
and a Negro boy to wait on me, and provisions ready dressed for my<br>
supper; and thus I was as if I had been in a new world, and began<br>
secretly now to wish that I had not brought my Lancashire husband from<br>
England at all.<br>
<br>
However, that wish was not hearty neither, for I loved my Lancashire<br>
husband entirely, as indeed I had ever done from the beginning; and he<br>
merited from me as much as it was possible for a man to do; but that by<br>
the way.<br>
<br>
The next morning my son came to visit me again almost as soon as I was<br>
up. After a little discourse, he first of all pulled out a deerskin<br>
bag, and gave it me, with five-and-fifty Spanish pistoles in it, and<br>
told me that was to supply my expenses from England, for though it was<br>
not his business to inquire, yet he ought to think I did not bring a<br>
great deal of money out with me, it not being usual to bring much money<br>
into that country. Then he pulled out his grandmother&rsquo;s will, and read<br>
it over to me, whereby it appeared that she had left a small<br>
plantation, as he called it, on York River, that is, where my mother<br>
lived, to me, with the stock of servants and cattle upon it, and given<br>
it in trust to this son of mine for my use, whenever he should hear of<br>
my being alive, and to my heirs, if I had any children, and in default<br>
of heirs, to whomsoever I should by will dispose of it; but gave the<br>
income of it, till I should be heard of, or found, to my said son; and<br>
if I should not be living, then it was to him, and his heirs.<br>
<br>
This plantation, though remote from him, he said he did not let out,<br>
but managed it by a head-clerk (steward), as he did another that was<br>
his father&rsquo;s, that lay hard by it, and went over himself three or four<br>
times a year to look after it. I asked him what he thought the<br>
plantation might be worth. He said, if I would let it out, he would<br>
give me about &pound;60 a year for it; but if I would live on it, then it<br>
would be worth much more, and, he believed, would bring me in about<br>
&pound;150 a year. But seeing I was likely either to settle on the other side<br>
of the bay, or might perhaps have a mind to go back to England again,<br>
if I would let him be my steward he would manage it for me, as he had<br>
done for himself, and that he believed he should be able to send me as<br>
much tobacco to England from it as would yield me about &pound;100 a year,<br>
sometimes more.<br>
<br>
This was all strange news to me, and things I had not been used to; and<br>
really my heart began to look up more seriously than I think it ever<br>
did before, and to look with great thankfulness to the hand of<br>
Providence, which had done such wonders for me, who had been myself the<br>
greatest wonder of wickedness perhaps that had been suffered to live in<br>
the world. And I must again observe, that not on this occasion only,<br>
but even on all other occasions of thankfulness, my past wicked and<br>
abominable life never looked so monstrous to me, and I never so<br>
completely abhorred it, and reproached myself with it, as when I had a<br>
sense upon me of Providence doing good to me, while I had been making<br>
those vile returns on my part.<br>
<br>
But I leave the reader to improve these thoughts, as no doubt they will<br>
see cause, and I go on to the fact. My son&rsquo;s tender carriage and kind<br>
offers fetched tears from me, almost all the while he talked with me.<br>
Indeed, I could scarce discourse with him but in the intervals of my<br>
passion; however, at length I began, and expressing myself with wonder<br>
at my being so happy to have the trust of what I had left, put into the<br>
hands of my own child, I told him, that as to the inheritance of it, I<br>
had no child but him in the world, and was now past having any if I<br>
should marry, and therefore would desire him to get a writing drawn,<br>
which I was ready to execute, by which I would, after me, give it<br>
wholly to him and to his heirs. And in the meantime, smiling, I asked<br>
him what made him continue a bachelor so long. His answer was kind and<br>
ready, that Virginia did not yield any great plenty of wives, and that<br>
since I talked of going back to England, I should send him a wife from<br>
London.<br>
<br>
This was the substance of our first day&rsquo;s conversation, the pleasantest<br>
day that ever passed over my head in my life, and which gave me the<br>
truest satisfaction. He came every day after this, and spent a great<br>
part of his time with me, and carried me about to several of his<br>
friends&rsquo; houses, where I was entertained with great respect. Also I<br>
dined several times at his own house, when he took care always to see<br>
his half-dead father so out of the way that I never saw him, or he me.<br>
I made him one present, and it was all I had of value, and that was one<br>
of the gold watches, of which I mentioned above, that I had two in my<br>
chest, and this I happened to have with me, and I gave it him at his<br>
third visit. I told him I had nothing of any value to bestow but that,<br>
and I desired he would now and then kiss it for my sake. I did not<br>
indeed tell him that I had stole it from a gentlewoman&rsquo;s side, at a<br>
meeting-house in London. That&rsquo;s by the way.<br>
<br>
He stood a little while hesitating, as if doubtful whether to take it<br>
or no; but I pressed it on him, and made him accept it, and it was not<br>
much less worth than his leather pouch full of Spanish gold; no, though<br>
it were to be reckoned as if at London, whereas it was worth twice as<br>
much there, where I gave it him. At length he took it, kissed it, told<br>
me the watch should be a debt upon him that he would be paying as long<br>
as I lived.<br>
<br>
A few days after he brought the writings of gift, and the scrivener<br>
with them, and I signed them very freely, and delivered them to him<br>
with a hundred kisses; for sure nothing ever passed between a mother<br>
and a tender, dutiful child with more affection. The next day he brings<br>
me an obligation under his hand and seal, whereby he engaged himself to<br>
manage and improve the plantation for my account, and with his utmost<br>
skill, and to remit the produce to my order wherever I should be; and<br>
withal, to be obliged himself to make up the produce &pound;100 a year to me.<br>
When he had done so, he told me that as I came to demand it before the<br>
crop was off, I had a right to produce of the current year, and so he<br>
paid me &pound;100 in Spanish pieces of eight, and desired me to give him a<br>
receipt for it as in full for that year, ending at Christmas following;<br>
this being about the latter end of August.<br>
<br>
I stayed here about five weeks, and indeed had much ado to get away<br>
then. Nay, he would have come over the bay with me, but I would by no<br>
means allow him to it. However, he would send me over in a sloop of his<br>
own, which was built like a yacht, and served him as well for pleasure<br>
as business. This I accepted of, and so, after the utmost expressions<br>
both of duty and affection, he let me come away, and I arrived safe in<br>
two days at my friend&rsquo;s the Quaker&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
I brought over with me for the use of our plantation, three horses,<br>
with harness and saddles, some hogs, two cows, and a thousand other<br>
things, the gift of the kindest and tenderest child that ever woman<br>
had. I related to my husband all the particulars of this voyage, except<br>
that I called my son my cousin; and first I told him that I had lost my<br>
watch, which he seemed to take as a misfortune; but then I told him how<br>
kind my cousin had been, that my mother had left me such a plantation,<br>
and that he had preserved it for me, in hopes some time or other he<br>
should hear from me; then I told him that I had left it to his<br>
management, that he would render me a faithful account of its produce;<br>
and then I pulled him out the &pound;100 in silver, as the first year&rsquo;s<br>
produce; and then pulling out the deerskin purse with the pistoles,<br>
&ldquo;And here, my dear,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;is the gold watch.&rdquo; My husband&mdash;so is<br>
Heaven&rsquo;s goodness sure to work the same effects in all sensible minds<br>
where mercies touch the heart&mdash;lifted up both hands, and with an ecstacy<br>
of joy, &ldquo;What is God a-doing,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;for such an ungrateful dog as<br>
I am!&rdquo; Then I let him know what I had brought over in the sloop,<br>
besides all this; I mean the horses, hogs, and cows, and other stores<br>
for our plantation; all which added to his surprise, and filled his<br>
heart with thankfulness; and from this time forward I believe he was as<br>
sincere a penitent, and as thoroughly a reformed man, as ever God&rsquo;s<br>
goodness brought back from a profligate, a highwayman, and a robber. I<br>
could fill a larger history than this with the evidence of this truth,<br>
and but that I doubt that part of the story will not be equally<br>
diverting as the wicked part, I have had thoughts of making a volume of<br>
it by itself.<br>
<br>
As for myself, as this is to be my own story, not my husband&rsquo;s, I<br>
return to that part which related to myself. We went on with our<br>
plantation, and managed it with the help and diversion of such friends<br>
as we got there by our obliging behaviour, and especially the honest<br>
Quaker, who proved a faithful, generous, and steady friend to us; and<br>
we had very good success, for having a flourishing stock to begin with,<br>
as I have said, and this being now increased by the addition of &pound;150<br>
sterling in money, we enlarged our number of servants, built us a very<br>
good house, and cured every year a great deal of land. The second year<br>
I wrote to my old governess, giving her part with us of the joy of our<br>
success, and order her how to lay out the money I had left with her,<br>
which was &pound;250 as above, and to send it to us in goods, which she<br>
performed with her usual kindness and fidelity, and this arrived safe<br>
to us.<br>
<br>
Here we had a supply of all sorts of clothes, as well for my husband as<br>
for myself; and I took especial care to buy for him all those things<br>
that I knew he delighted to have; as two good long wigs, two<br>
silver-hilted swords, three or four fine fowling-pieces, a fine saddle<br>
with holsters and pistols very handsome, with a scarlet cloak; and, in<br>
a word, everything I could think of to oblige him, and to make him<br>
appear, as he really was, a very fine gentleman. I ordered a good<br>
quantity of such household stuff as we yet wanted, with linen of all<br>
sorts for us both. As for myself, I wanted very little of clothes or<br>
linen, being very well furnished before. The rest of my cargo consisted<br>
in iron-work of all sorts, harness for horses, tools, clothes for<br>
servants, and woollen cloth, stuffs, serges, stockings, shoes, hats,<br>
and the like, such as servants wear; and whole pieces also to make up<br>
for servants, all by direction of the Quaker; and all this cargo<br>
arrived safe, and in good condition, with three woman-servants, lusty<br>
wenches, which my old governess had picked for me, suitable enough to<br>
the place, and to the work we had for them to do; one of which happened<br>
to come double, having been got with child by one of the seamen in the<br>
ship, as she owned afterwards, before the ship got so far as Gravesend;<br>
so she brought us a stout boy, about seven months after her landing.<br>
<br>
My husband, you may suppose, was a little surprised at the arriving of<br>
all this cargo from England; and talking with me after he saw the<br>
account of this particular, &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;what is the meaning of<br>
all this? I fear you will run us too deep in debt: when shall we be<br>
able to make return for it all?&rdquo; I smiled, and told him that it was all<br>
paid for; and then I told him, that what our circumstances might expose<br>
us to, I had not taken my whole stock with me, that I had reserved so<br>
much in my friend&rsquo;s hands, which now we were come over safe, and was<br>
settled in a way to live, I had sent for, as he might see.<br>
<br>
He was amazed, and stood a while telling upon his fingers, but said<br>
nothing. At last he began thus: &ldquo;Hold, let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; says he, telling<br>
upon his fingers still, and first on his thumb; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s &pound;246 in money<br>
at first, then two gold watches, diamond rings, and plate,&rdquo; says he,<br>
upon the forefinger. Then upon the next finger, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a plantation on<br>
York River, &pound;100 a year, then &pound;150 in money, then a sloop load of<br>
horses, cows, hogs, and stores&rdquo;; and so on to the thumb again. &ldquo;And<br>
now,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;a cargo cost &pound;250 in England, and worth here twice the<br>
money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;what do you make of all that?&rdquo; &ldquo;Make of it?&rdquo;<br>
says he; &ldquo;why, who says I was deceived when I married a wife in<br>
Lancashire? I think I have married a fortune, and a very good fortune<br>
too,&rdquo; says he.<br>
<br>
In a word, we were now in very considerable circumstances, and every<br>
year increasing; for our new plantation grew upon our hands insensibly,<br>
and in eight years which we lived upon it, we brought it to such pitch,<br>
that the produce was at least &pound;300 sterling a year; I mean, worth so<br>
much in England.<br>
<br>
After I had been a year at home again, I went over the bay to see my<br>
son, and to receive another year&rsquo;s income of my plantation; and I was<br>
surprised to hear, just at my landing there, that my old husband was<br>
dead, and had not been buried above a fortnight. This, I confess, was<br>
not disagreeable news, because now I could appear as I was, in a<br>
married condition; so I told my son before I came from him, that I<br>
believed I should marry a gentleman who had a plantation near mine; and<br>
though I was legally free to marry, as to any obligation that was on me<br>
before, yet that I was shy of it, lest the blot should some time or<br>
other be revived, and it might make a husband uneasy. My son, the same<br>
kind, dutiful, and obliging creature as ever, treated me now at his own<br>
house, paid me my hundred pounds, and sent me home again loaded with<br>
presents.<br>
<br>
Some time after this, I let my son know I was married, and invited him<br>
over to see us, and my husband wrote a very obliging letter to him<br>
also, inviting him to come and see him; and he came accordingly some<br>
months after, and happened to be there just when my cargo from England<br>
came in, which I let him believe belonged all to my husband&rsquo;s estate,<br>
not to me.<br>
<br>
It must be observed that when the old wretch my brother (husband) was<br>
dead, I then freely gave my husband an account of all that affair, and<br>
of this cousin, as I had called him before, being my own son by that<br>
mistaken unhappy match. He was perfectly easy in the account, and told<br>
me he should have been as easy if the old man, as we called him, had<br>
been alive. &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it<br>
was a mistake impossible to be prevented.&rdquo; He only reproached him with<br>
desiring me to conceal it, and to live with him as a wife, after I knew<br>
that he was my brother; that, he said, was a vile part. Thus all these<br>
difficulties were made easy, and we lived together with the greatest<br>
kindness and comfort imaginable.<br>
<br>
We are grown old; I am come back to England, being almost seventy years<br>
of age, husband sixty-eight, having performed much more than the<br>
limited terms of my transportation; and now, notwithstanding all the<br>
fatigues and all the miseries we have both gone through, we are both of<br>
us in good heart and health. My husband remained there some time after<br>
me to settle our affairs, and at first I had intended to go back to<br>
him, but at his desire I altered that resolution, and he is come over<br>
to England also, where we resolve to spend the remainder of our years<br>
in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived.<br>
