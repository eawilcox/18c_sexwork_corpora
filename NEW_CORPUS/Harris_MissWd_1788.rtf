 mill Street, Tottenham Court Road_.<br>
<br>
 -------Fair<br>
 As May morning rising from the east,<br>
 Or day dismounting from the golden west.<br>
<br>
 This young charmer is of the middle<br>
size, and the resplendent black of her<br>
lively eyes is finely contrasted by the<br>
fairness of her complexion and lightness<br>
of her hair: her teeth are good, and her<br>
temper complying. She is really a delici-<br>
ous piece, and her _terra incognita_ is so<br>
very agreeable to every traveller therein,<br>
that it hath ceas'd to deserve that name,<br>
and is become a well known and much<br>
frequented country; freely _taking in_ the<br>
stranger, _raising_ up them that _fall_,<br>
making the _crooked straight_, and although<br>
she does not pretend to restore sight to<br>
the blind, she'll place him in such a direc-<br>
tion that he cannot mistake the way; and<br>
for one guinea will engage he returns the<br>
same way back without any direction at<br>
all.</font></span></font></body>
