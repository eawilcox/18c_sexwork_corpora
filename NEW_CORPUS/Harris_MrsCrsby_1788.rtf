over Black Fryars Bridge_.<br>
<br>
Fast lock'd in her arms,<br>
And enjoying her charms,<br>
Every frown of old care I'll defy;<br>
Give desire such a loose,<br>
That the all potent _Juice_,<br>
Shall pervade ev'ry sense, and swim in each<br>
Eye.<br>
<br>
Birmingham lays claim to the birth of<br>
this daughter of love, and, under the<br>
care and protection of an indulgent<br>
father and mother, she reached her<br>
fifteenth year &quot; pure and unsullied;&quot;<br>
at this period nature began to be very<br>
bay with Nancy, and a strong propen-<br>
sity for seeing _Life_, compelled her to<br>
leave her parents and enter into servitude,<br>
and being particularly attached to the<br>
sons of Neptune, she chose for her<br>
master a sea captain, whose name she<br>
still prefers to any other. A twelve<br>
month had not elapsed in the captain's<br>
service before our charmer's feelings had<br>
reached their highest pitch, and the<br>
captain, blest with a keen appetite, after<br>
a six months voyage, with little persua-<br>
sion, opened her _port hole_, cleared her<br>
_gangway_, and threw her virtue _overboard_.<br>
He grew strongly attached to her, and,<br>
being a man rather advanced in years,<br>
became contented and happy, nor<br>
wished for any other but his dear Nancy.<br>
She was his own, and he was all she at<br>
that time wished or desired for; one or<br>
two little prattlers were pledges of their<br>
mutual regard, and till the day of the<br>
captain's death they lived &quot; the happy<br>
pair.&quot; It is near two years since she<br>
lost her friend, by whose death she<br>
receives a little annuity, that will ever<br>
keep her from the necessity of parading<br>
the streets _merely_ for support, and you<br>
are certain to meet with her at home at<br>
almost any hour of the day; in the<br>
evening the generally visits one of the<br>
Theatres, and always sits in the side<br>
boxes, in which place she contrives to<br>
chuse her spark, and if possible to take<br>
him home with her (for she never sleeps<br>
out,) where he will meet with snug com-<br>
fortable apartments, civility, good hu-<br>
mour, and a very engaging partner,<br>
whilst she continues good humoured; if<br>
he uses any language or behaviour to<br>
ruffle her temper, she can act the Virago<br>
as well as most of her sex. She is rather<br>
below mediocrity in size, with dark hair,<br>
flowing in ringlets down her back, <br>
languishing grey eyes, and a very toler-<br>
able complexion, and a pair of pretty<br>
little firm _bubbies_. Her leg and foot is<br>
particularly graceful, always ornamented<br>
with a white silk stocking, and a neat<br>
shoe; she is a loving bed-fellow, and<br>
sincerely _attaches_ herself to the enjoyment,<br>
feels the thrilling sensation with poig-<br>
nancy, and for one guinea will _enjoy_ you<br>
as many times as you please.<br>
<br>
N. B. She keeps the house, and you<br>
must not mention to her a syllable con-<br>
cerning her pretty lodger _above_, if you<br>
wish to be calm _below_.<br>
