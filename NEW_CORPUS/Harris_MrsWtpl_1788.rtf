 Oxford-Street_.<br>
<br>
 She smil'd, and gave a kiss might Jove disarm,<br>
 And from his hand the brandished thunder<br>
 charm.<br>
<br>
 If this good natured willing girl should<br>
chance to be engaged herself, she will<br>
with the greatest pleasure provide her<br>
gentleman with another companion;<br>
she is a genteel woman, and a very<br>
chearful companion, completely mis-<br>
tress of the sport, and can _turn_ and<br>
_twist_ in all the enchanting folds of love,<br>
and press you to her breast,<br>
 In all the extatic raptures of a lover;<br>
will enjoy, or seem to enjoy, every _high<br>
toned_ sensation; will bend eagerly to<br>
meet the _succulent shower_ of b1iss, and<br>
repeat the amorous content as frequently<br>
as you please, being first _convinced_ that<br>
you will make her a guinea richer in the<br>
morning.<br>
