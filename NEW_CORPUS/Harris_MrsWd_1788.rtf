 Fields_.<br>
<br>
 Oh! that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,<br>
 And with a virtuous vizard hide deep vice.<br>
<br>
 Mens palates are as various as their<br>
faces, and like a good ordinary we would<br>
offer up a dish for every palate. In the<br>
time of the ancient Romans we are told<br>
that the fat paps of the sow where held a<br>
great dainty. For those that have a re-<br>
lish for such a repast we recommend<br>
Mrs. Wood, and can assure them, such<br>
paps as she possesses are seldom to be met<br>
with. She keeps the house, and is wife<br>
to 'squire P--'s coachman, late of the sta-<br>
bles, Bolton street; her front is well bra-<br>
zen'd; her face is continually upon the<br>
full grin, and as for talking bawdy, swea-<br>
ring, or bare fac'd indecency, she could<br>
vie with the ancient _Meselina_ of Rome;<br>
she dispenses her favours for any sum to<br>
one whose arms are sufficiently long to<br>
embrace her, and may do now, but in<br>
the dog days must be intolerable.</font></span></font></body>
