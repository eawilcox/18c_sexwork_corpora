<body><font face="Courier"><span style="font-size:13pt"><font color="#000000">Miss M--nt--n, No. 55, _Berwick-Street,<br>
 Soho_.<br>
<br>
 Toil all the night, and at the approach of<br>
 morn,<br>
 When tir'd nature calls aloud for rest,<br>
 The wanton fair, a stranger to fatigue,<br>
 With eager fondness will renew the sport;<br>
 Entwine the busy limbs to force the joy,<br>
 Whilst through the parting lips, the playful<br>
 tongue,<br>
 The vital fire thro' every nerve propels,<br>
 And drown the senses in love's potent stream.<br>
<br>
 Would the amorous _devotee_ wish us<br>
to say more, perhaps he may require<br>
personal charms, even then he will not<br>
be disappointed; she is of the brunette<br>
cast, with fine languishing eyes, fine<br>
even teeth, plump, well formed, pant-<br>
ing bubbies, and as she has now only<br>
entered into her nineteenth year, can-<br>
not possibly have lost the transports<br>
of _mutuality_; at present she trades the<br>
independant lass, having no particular<br>
friend to humour or offend; she takes<br>
her noon and evening excursions re-<br>
gularly, and enjoys, with unfeigned rap-<br>
ture, every man of pleasure that _en-<br>
ters_ properly equipped for the sport;<br>
and her love of variety, and her at-<br>
tachment to the sport, is so very<br>
prevalent, that, provided the gentle-<br>
man's pocket is sufficiently armed,<br>
there is not the least reason to fear she<br>
then will meet him _midway_, with true<br>
rapture, will _grasp_ the _pointed weapon_ with<br>
genuine female fortitude, and urge him<br>
_home_ with singular delight, _lesson_ his<br>
_pride_ with becoming dignity, and ask<br>
repeated pleasures.------It is now only<br>
eight months we have been able to<br>
call her _our own_, and as she seems sa-<br>
tisfied with one guinea, would recom-<br>
mend her as a _deserving_ peice.<br>
