 Street, Rathbone-Place_.<br>
<br>
 If women were as little as they are good,<br>
 A peas cod would make them a gown and a<br>
 hood.<br>
<br>
A pretty, little, lively, fair complex-<br>
ioned girl, with a dainty leg and foot,<br>
and as pretty a pair of pouting bubbies<br>
as ever went against a man's stomach,<br>
and one who well deserves the attention<br>
that is paid her by every man capable of<br>
knowing her value. She is pleasing,<br>
though fond, and can make wantonness<br>
delightful; every part assists to bring on<br>
the momomentary delirium, and then each<br>
part combines to raise up the fallen mem-<br>
ber, to contribute again to repeated<br>
rapture; her price is commonly two guineas,<br>
but if a man is clever, she is very<br>
ready to make some abatement.</font></span></font></body>
