 street, Red Lion Square_.<br>
<br>
 Behold her round the vine, in loose attire,<br>
 Her panting bosom thrills with soft desire,<br>
 Which white and firm invites the amorous hand,<br>
 And never fails to make the member stand;<br>
 Then to her couch she'll lead the conquered<br>
 boy,<br>
 Who in her feels a tickling pinching joy.<br>
<br>
 Bishopsgate-street is the place that gave<br>
birth to this volatile charmer; her father<br>
moved in the sphere of a hackney-coach-<br>
man, and reared this daughter of Venus<br>
with no small care, till she attained her<br>
sixteenth year, at which period, a young<br>
man about twenty wooed her, and she did<br>
not repulse him; but found his embraces<br>
so agreeable, that she soon wished for<br>
food more substantial than kisses; but<br>
then the thought of sacrificing her cha-<br>
racter to her pleasure was a bar not easily<br>
surmounted, but nature called so loud<br>
for its favorite _choak pear_, that she resolved<br>
to throw herself into the arms of the<br>
vigorous youth, and for the first time<br>
suck the juice of the enchanting fruit;<br>
a few promises and vows of his, fully<br>
preponderated all her maiden niceties,<br>
and she soon yielded to the giddy im-<br>
pulse of her passion;<br>
<br>
 She did not stay for marriage, that stale<br>
 trick,<br>
 But lost her reputation for a----;<br>
<br>
but the cruel laceration that this first<br>
attack was productive of, obliged her to<br>
confine herself to her bed two days, and<br>
led her parents to the discovery of their<br>
daughter's shame, which so highly in-<br>
censed them, that they abandoned her to<br>
the world at large; and from this aera<br>
we may date her entrance into life. The<br>
_Kite_, in _Catherine-street_, first _swooped_ upon<br>
her, and carried her to the _nest_ as a fine<br>
prey, and she was not mistaken; she<br>
proved such, and for six months never<br>
was in want of _culls_; at the end of this<br>
time ihe deserted the mother abbess,<br>
took apartments in Glanville-street, and<br>
traded on her own _bottom_, where she<br>
figured away with tolerable grace for<br>
three months, and then removed to her<br>
prefent situation. She is diminitive in<br>
size, with fine black eyes, large firm, and<br>
full breasts, a handsome mouth, pretty<br>
curling brown ringlets, and delicate lit-<br>
tle hands; a very pretty leg and foot,<br>
which is at all times ready to divide and<br>
_house_ its old friend, at the very low price<br>
of one ounce of silver.</font></span></font></body>
