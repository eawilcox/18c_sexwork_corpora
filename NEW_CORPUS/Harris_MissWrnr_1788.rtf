 Street, Leicester-Fields_.<br>
<br>
 Embrace me close, and join thy lips to mine,<br>
 There's no security in other joys;<br>
 Here happiness is rivetted alone;<br>
 Here nothing fades, nothing decays, the fweets<br>
 Immortal are, and never cease to spring.<br>
<br>
 This is a fine girl, lately come from<br>
Cambridge, and just dancing into her<br>
twentieth year, we have known her but<br>
a very little time, but from her com-<br>
plexion, which is bordering on the<br>
brunette; her lively hazel eyes, and<br>
the lovely pouting orbs of nature, we can<br>
venture to affirm her no bad sportswoman;<br>
the _grove beneath_ is beautifully border'd<br>
by a _sable fringe_, the _ruby portals_ of<br>
which when unfolded, display the _coral<br>
tipt janitor_ strutting in all the luscious<br>
mess of full fraught womanhood, and<br>
will safely conduct the well erected engine<br>
into the harbour of delight, and bath<br>
him, in the choicest sweets of nature, for<br>
two pounds, two shillings.<br>
