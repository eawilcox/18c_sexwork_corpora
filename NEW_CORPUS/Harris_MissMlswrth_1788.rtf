 street, Oxford-street_.<br>
<br>
 A summer's day will seem an hour but short,<br>
 Being wasted in such time-be guiling sport.<br>
<br>
 Without possessing any particular at-<br>
tracing charms this lady pleases, and has<br>
many admirers. Her face is agreeable<br>
without being pretty, she is well made,<br>
without being strictly genteel; and a friend<br>
to mirth and good humour, without vul-<br>
garity. She carries on a snug good trade,<br>
without going much abroad, and is in bed<br>
a very amorous companion. If she does go<br>
abroad it is generally to some of the pub-<br>
iic hops, where she contrives to select out<br>
her partner for the night, and will con-<br>
vince him (although she dances well a-<br>
midst twenty couple) that she _cuts_ a much<br>
better _figure_ with only _one_, and being now<br>
only twenty years of age,with good nature,<br>
affability, and love depicted in all her<br>
actions, no one that has three guineas in<br>
his pocket, ought to be against parting<br>
with two thirds to oblige her.<br>
