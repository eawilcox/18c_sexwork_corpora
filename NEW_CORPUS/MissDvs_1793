<body>Miss D-vis, No. 22, Upper Newman-street.<br>
<br>
Artful ways beguile the implicit rake.<br>
<br>
THIS is a fine lively girl, about twenty-one, rather above the middle <br>
size, genteely made; has several good friends, but is much attached <br>
to young Br-om, the lottery-office-keeper, who is now in prison, <br>
where she often visits him; is ever obliging, and seldom out of <br>
humour, understands a great deal of her business, and never fails to <br>
please. She enjoys her favourite man with ecstasy; and pleases, with <br>
cold indifference, managed by art, the rest of her votaries; who are <br>
content with thinking they have fathomed the deepest part of a girl <br>
so replete with sensation; in short, she can so well counterfeit the <br>
passions of love and lust, that many of the most knowing rakes of the <br>
town would be easily deceived. This lady occupies the parlour.</body>
