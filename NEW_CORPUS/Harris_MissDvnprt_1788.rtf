 Leicester-fields_.<br>
<br>
 The nymphs like Nereids round her couch<br>
 were plac'd,<br>
 Where she another sea-born Venus lay;<br>
 She lay and lean'd her cheek upon her hand,<br>
 And cast a look fo languishingly sweet,<br>
 As if secure of all beholders hearts,<br>
 Neglecting she could take 'em.<br>
<br>
 This young charmer, for she is not<br>
yet past the bloom of eighteen, has so<br>
beautiful a face, that though here and<br>
there the general ravager of beauty has<br>
left his dented marks in a skin, that the<br>
finest tints of the tulip, carnation, or<br>
rose, blended with the hue of the fairest<br>
lily, cannot equal, (so vastly superior is<br>
the vermilion tinge of nature, in this her<br>
choicest and most animated work over<br>
all other) yet their effect is rather pleas-<br>
ing than otherwise; and perhaps have<br>
tempered a blaze of beauty, which with-<br>
out them would have been insupportable.<br>
Her eyes are of that colour, which the<br>
celebrated Fielding has given the heroine<br>
ofhis most admirable work, and which<br>
dart a lustre peculiar to themselves.<br>
From such an eye each look has power<br>
to raise<br>
<br>
 &quot;The loosest wishes in the chastest heart,&quot;'<br>
<br>
and melt the soul to all the thrillings of<br>
unasked desire, till quite overpowered<br>
with the transporting gaze, the senses<br>
faint, and hasten to enjoyment. Her<br>
hair is also black, of which great orna-<br>
ment, nature has been lavishly bountiful,<br>
for when loose, it flows in unlimited<br>
tresses down to her waist; nor are the<br>
_tendrills_ of the _moss covered grotto_ thinner<br>
distributed, but though not yet _bushy_,<br>
might truly be stiled _Black Heath_; how<br>
early this _thicket_ of her maidenhead _was<br>
penetrated_ through, by the natural invader<br>
of _Middlesex_, we cannot pretend to say;<br>
moft probably when it was only<br>
a small brake; for from its present<br>
state, and the extraordinary warmth<br>
of the soil, it must have began to shoot<br>
very early, and the mother of all things<br>
must have opened the sanguinary sluices<br>
in this delightful _Channel_, at an early<br>
period. The mount above, has a most<br>
delicious swell, as ambitious to receive<br>
on it downy bed, its _swelling rival_and<br>
_antagonist_, and it is so well clothed, that<br>
it may be justly called the Cyprian<br>
Grove; whilst her breasts are so fine and<br>
so fully shaped, as to entitle her to be<br>
stiled _en bon point_, in the richest sense of<br>
the words, and they have a springinness<br>
that defies any weight whatever, of amo-<br>
rous pressure. Here the voluptuary<br>
might revel in pleasure, better imagined<br>
than described, in<br>
<br>
 &quot;Soft silent rapture and extatic bliss.&quot;<br>
<br>
Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is<br>
tall, and so well proportioned (when you<br>
examine her whole naked figure, which<br>
she will permit you to do, if you per-<br>
form Cytherean Rites like an able priest)<br>
that she might be taken for a fourth<br>
Grace, or a breathing Animated Venus<br>
de Medicis. Her disposition and tem-<br>
per is remarkably good, so sweet that it<br>
is your own fault if it be soured;<br>
for she is possesed of an uncommon<br>
share of politeness, nothing rude or un-<br>
courteous in her manner, but abounding<br>
with civility and good breeding; her<br>
connections are good, and she has a<br>
keeper (a Mr. H--nn--h) both kind<br>
and liberal; notwithstanding which, she<br>
has no objection to two supernumerary<br>
guineas.</font></span></font></body>
