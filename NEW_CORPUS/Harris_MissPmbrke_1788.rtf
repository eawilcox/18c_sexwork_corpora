 Adelphi_.<br>
<br>
 Where did my soul in the dear transport go?<br>
 Did it with willing haste to her depart?<br>
 It did, I'm sure, and fluttered around her<br>
 heart;<br>
 It heav'd, it trembled, and it panted there,<br>
 But all its weak efforts to stay were vain,<br>
 A kiss restored the fugitive again;<br>
 My soul re-enterd, we repeated o'er<br>
 A thousand joys unknown to both before.<br>
<br>
 In the bloom of sixteen, tall and ele-<br>
gantly genteel, with fine black expressive<br>
eyes, and remarkable fine hair, which<br>
flows in graceful ringlets down her back,<br>
and with an envious shade sweetly pro-<br>
tects two of the most enchanting snowy<br>
hillocks nature ever formed. Miss<br>
P---- may well please, may well<br>
attract the eye. She does please, she<br>
does attract, and upon every account<br>
well merits the attention of the man of<br>
true taste. Untutored by art, and taught<br>
only by powerful nature, she charms in<br>
enjoyment; and as she has not, from<br>
over frequency, been rendered callous<br>
to the joys of love, she repays every<br>
rapture with interest, and meets the<br>
blissful moment with a tepid flood of<br>
delight. At present she is in good<br>
keeping by a citizen, not many miles<br>
from Fleet Market, and having been<br>
only three months under his care, has<br>
not yet been sufficiently broke for the<br>
sport, hope therefore that some of our<br>
good friends will, by properly supplying<br>
the citizen's place at those hours his<br>
employment obliges him to be absent,<br>
_instill_ into _her_ such _principles_ that will<br>
at least raise her spunk to _proof_; but'<br>
altho' young, she can well dispense with<br>
a little more pocket money than her<br>
keeper allows, and always expects twice<br>
the number of pieces that her paramour<br>
gives proofs of his manhood.<br>
