 street_.<br>
<br>
 Firm breasts, white belly, and such thighs,<br>
 Gaze ghastly envy, and forget her size.<br>
<br>
 This lady's affable temper, and en-<br>
gaging disposition, fully compensates<br>
for her size, which is rather diminutive,<br>
and the innumerable beauties of her face,<br>
when put in competition with this defi-<br>
ciency, ought entirely to efface the small-<br>
est idea of it. From her youth we might<br>
be led to imagine her deficient in the<br>
practice of love, but we can assure our<br>
readers he will meet but few in the _cy-<br>
prian field_ that will shew better sport;<br>
her hair is a beautiful glossy dark brown;<br>
her eye brows finely arc'd, and of the<br>
same hue, which, contrasted by a pair of<br>
beautiful cerulean eyes, and cheeks of<br>
living roses and lilies, places her in the<br>
rank of first rate beauties,<br>
<br>
 Her rising breasts two hillocks are of snow,<br>
 On which two little fragrant rose buds grow;<br>
<br>
below which descends the smooth track<br>
of a belly, which conveys to the mind an<br>
idea of animated ivory, at the bottom<br>
of which is display'd a lovely chesnut<br>
fringe, terminated by a pouting _slash hole_,<br>
which is far from being insensible to the<br>
raptures of its _grisly antagonist_, and with<br>
pleasure _opens_ its _mouth_ to receive his well<br>
erected crest, who _enters_ with his accus-<br>
tomed pride, but soon returns with _fal-<br>
len head_, as if conscious of its presumption;<br>
but the _mistress_ of this formidable _enemy_<br>
is well acquainted with the means of re-<br>
storing life to the _vanquished memmber_, but<br>
only to make it more sensible of its ina-<br>
bility. Mercenary views are far from<br>
what she aims at; she can give and<br>
receive a _luscious_ share of pleasures<br>
of _copulation_; but beginning to know the<br>
accustom'd ways of the baser sort of<br>
men, and not being always confident of<br>
the honour of her _paramour_, if he is a<br>
stranger, she must receive her compli-<br>
ment of half a guinea, or a guinea, ac-<br>
cording to the length of the intended<br>
visit, before she proceeds to any kind of<br>
business.<br>
