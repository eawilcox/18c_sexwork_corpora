 Queen-Ann-Street_.<br>
<br>
 No time shall pass without that dear delight,<br>
 I'll talk of love all day, and aca it all the night;<br>
 Pleasure and I as to one goal design'd,<br>
 Will run with equal pace, while sorrow lays<br>
 behind.<br>
<br>
 Those who choose to sail the island<br>
of love in a _first rate_ ship, or to enclose<br>
an armful of delight, must be pleased<br>
with this lady; who, tho' only seventeen<br>
and short, is very fat and corpulent;<br>
yet, notwithstanding, she is a fine piece<br>
of frailty; her face is handsome and<br>
 her<br>
<br>
 ( 18 )<br>
<br>
her _nut brown locks_, which are placed<br>
_above_ and below, promise a luscious<br>
treat to the voluptuary. Her temper is<br>
agreeable and pleasing, and she is so far<br>
from being mercenary, that a single<br>
guinea is the boundage of her wish.</font></span></font></body>
