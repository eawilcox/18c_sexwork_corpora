 Rathbone Place_.<br>
<br>
 Sure nature cast one in her softest mould,<br>
 All mild and gentle, never made to scold.<br>
<br>
 West Indies gave birth to this daugh-<br>
ter of Momus by Venus; the warmth of<br>
the clime brought the charming girl's feel-<br>
ing to maturity at an early period, and<br>
a gentleman, whose name she assumes,<br>
first _trod_ down _Hymen's_ fence, and made<br>
her a perfect woman; but the natural<br>
warmth of her constitution soon compell-<br>
ed her to seek variety in our great mart;<br>
she therefore left her good friend, and<br>
now presents the world with a sweet<br>
chearful disposition, fine dark hair, and<br>
eyes of the same friendly hue; fine teeth,<br>
is short and plump, and we have not had<br>
her above eighteen months; she expects<br>
three guineas for a whole night, but if you<br>
make a short visit, one pound one shilling<br>
is the least.<br>
