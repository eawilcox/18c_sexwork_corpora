<body><font face="Courier"><span style="font-size:13pt"><font color="#000000">Mrs. H--w--rd, No. 14, _Moor's-place,<br>
 Lambeth_.<br>
<br>
 Her brows are arch'd, and rather full and thin,<br>
 To shade the dazzling light that dwells therein.<br>
<br>
 Although Mrs. H--w--rd cannot be<br>
more than twenty-six, she has been a true<br>
sportswoman, at the cyprian games, for<br>
at least twelve years, and has within these<br>
late ones contracted such an habit of in-<br>
timacy with the gin bottle, that unless a<br>
person is particularly partial to it, it is al-<br>
most intolerable, to approach her. At<br>
Brighton, this last season, she was the fa-<br>
vourite girl at Mrs.John--n's, and had she<br>
not, through a foolish fondness, gave the<br>
preference to her dear Mr. Sn--m,<br>
it is in general believed Mr. W----, the<br>
capital Brewer, would have taken her<br>
under his own protection; she is rather too<br>
short, and too fat, fine dark hair; and<br>
eyes and eye-brows that answer very well<br>
to her motto; the _grove_ below is _well<br>
thatched_, and ample enough in size to _take<br>
in_ any guest; but still she has learnt the<br>
knack of _contracting_ it, and a small made<br>
gentleman may feel the tender friction.<br>
When she elopes from her dear fellow,<br>
she is to be met with at Mrs. J--ns--n's,<br>
in German-street, and does not turn<br>
away any money offered her.</font></span></font></body>
